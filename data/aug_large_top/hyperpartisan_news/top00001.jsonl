Hillary Clinton 's Presidential campaign spread the offensive and far fetched rumor that Latinos were less likely to vote for a black candidate for President , loosely basing such a ridiculous idea on tensions between Mexican / Chicano gangs and African - American gangs in Los Angeles .Now , the media has chosen to embrace a more truthful assumption about the Latino vote in this country : that many Latinos vote conservatively .This assumption is based mostly ( and solidly ) on how much of the Latino vote George W. Bush won in 2000 and 2004 .But I think some people - namely white liberals - are often shocked that a Latino can be anything but a blindly loyal Democrat .A lot of black people are also surprised to find out I do not subscribe to liberalism .I 'm surprised why more black Americans are n't conservative .At the risk of using sweeping generalizations , I do n't think that most people would doubt that blacks and Latinos are people of faith .Latinos pray almost as many times a day as Muslims , and blacks are the only people I know whose voice mail greetings are most likely to tell callers to have \" a blessed day .\" Like the Christian Right and the Republicans who pander to that voting bloc , Latinos and blacks invoke God into their personal lives on a daily basis , and not just when they take the Lord 's name into vain , either .Liberals , on the other hand , are widely regarded as being secular and atheist .Most white college professors are both liberal and secular to the point where they actually look down on people who believe in God .Most white liberals could n't care less that the right wing segment of American media label them as Godless and blame them for everything from the overblown \" war on Christmas \" to an alleged opposition to school prayer ... but Latinos care .While white liberals may enjoy depicting the evangelical Christian community in the U.S. as one operated solely by stereotypical angry white males , most within the mainstream evangelical community know that Latinos make an enormous contribution to their efforts .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"46.78592"}

{"text":"Moving that much earth does n't just require a lot of energy .It can also lead to toxic mine drainage , probably the biggest environmental concern associated with gold - mining .When you dig up rock that 's been buried for a long time , air and moisture can set off chemical reactions that produce acids and leach toxic metals .If those substances - sulfuric acid , arsenic and copper , for example - run off into lakes , rivers and streams , they will pose serious risks for populations of fish and other aquatic organisms .Mine drainage is a problem for many kinds of operations , but it 's especially significant for gold extraction .For one thing , gold is often found in rock that contains a lot of acid - generating sulfides ; for another , mining gold produces much more unwanted rock than does mining other minerals .Once you start extracting the gold from the ore , new issues arise .Take mercury , for example .The element , which has been linked to a host of negative health effects , is found in many metal and coal deposits .Large - scale gold operations often start processing ore by roasting it , which can shoot a lot of mercury into the atmosphere .( The same thing happens at coal - burning power plants , the source of about half the United States ' airborne mercury emissions in 2005 . )New pollution control technologies can greatly reduce the emissions from gold roasters .For example , according to University of Nevada environmental science professor Glenn Miller , scrubbers have helped Nevada cut its mercury emissions from more than 20,000 pounds a year a decade ago to just about 4,000 pounds a year .Meanwhile , there 's hope that new treatment processes can also alleviate the serious mercury pollution issues related to small - scale gold - mining in the developing world .According to the EPA , these operations - which produce about one - fifth of the world 's gold - are currently the planet 's No . 1 source of mercury releases to the environment .Whether or not they roast the ore , big mining operations typically finish off the extraction process by dousing the ore in cyanide .Cyanide is extremely lethal , but as an environmental contaminant it 's not as problematic as mercury , since it degrades fairly quickly .( Mercury sticks around forever . )Some of the byproducts of that degradation process , such as nitrates , may contaminate groundwater , but a bigger issue is that the use of cyanide allows mining companies to go after very low - grade ore .That means they end up digging up more earth to produce the same amount of gold , which produces huge amounts of tailings , the material that 's left over once the ore has been processed .Gold tailing ponds and piles are chock - full of contaminants such as arsenic , antimony , residual cyanide and mercury , and so must be carefully managed to avoid generating runoff or coming into contact with wildlife .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"28.859386"}

{"text":"The 1st Amendment is the most well known to Americans of all the amendments in the Bill of Rights .It contains some of the most familiar phrases in political discussion , such as freedom of religion , freedom of speech and freedom of the press .The 1stAmendment reads like this : .The 1stAmendment protects your right to believe and practice whatever religious principles you choose and your right to say what you believe , even if it is unpopular or against the will of elected officials .It also protects your right to publish any information you want , join together with whomever you want and ask the government to correct its own errors .What exactly does the 1stAmendment mean and how does it apply to people today ?Does it have relevance to you today ?It sure does .In fact , it affects just about everything you do .The 1stAmendment has seven clauses .This page has a brief description of each clause with links to more detailed information about the history and purpose of each section .The Opening Phrase of the 1st Amendment says \" Congress shall make no law .\"This opening phrase immediately tells exactly who this amendment is aimed at ... and that entity is Congress .So the 1st Amendment specifically prohibits Congress from making laws interfering with the rights mentioned in the amendment .It does not however , prohibit the states from making such laws , nor does it prohibit individuals from restricting these rights to those who may be under their authority , such as a parent and child or an employer and an employee .Learn more about the Opening Phrase of the 1st Amendment here .The Establishment Clause is the part of the 1stAmendment that says Congress shall make no law \" respecting an establishment of religion .\" This is a very crucial part of the American Constitution .It prohibits the government from establishing a state religion or denomination and from directing people in what they must believe .Without the Establishment Clause , the government could choose a state religion and force everyone to participate in it .It could also punish anyone who did n't adhere to its chosen faith .This clause has been the focus of much debate in the last half century .Some Americans believe that whenever the government is involved , absolutely all religious expression must be forbidden in order to comply with the Establishment Clause .For example , they might say a public school football team should not pray at a football game because the school is a government funded school .Other Americans believe the government must make certain allowances for religious expressions in public events and buildings because Americans are a very religious people .They belive a high school football team prayer or a government employee displaying a cross at work does not violate the Establishment Clause because it is simply a personal expression and not an expression endorsed by the state .Indeed , in the minds of some , banning expressions of religious faith like this is a violation of another clause of the 1st Amendment - the Free Exercise Clause , because it seeks to control the religious expressions of citizens .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"10.00042"}

{"text":"Experts say white supremacist groups are on the rise , fueled by a bad economy and the election of a black president .By Ron Scherer , Staff Writer , Kevin Loria , Contributor / August 6 , 2012 .The deadly shooting at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee is renewing concern about the white supremacist movement in the United States , which experts say is on the rise in large part because of the weak economy and a visceral distrust among some people of the first African - American president .Wade Michael Page , who gunned down six people Sunday before being shot and killed by police , was a member of a hardcore rock band that was part of underground movement featuring racist ideologies and he had coded racist tattoos .Police have not released any details as to Mr. Page 's motivations .Despite the increase in the number of hate groups , however , it is relatively rare for their vitriol to result in actual violence , experts say .Instead , their invective shows up on website chat rooms and in social media like Facebook and Twitter , using relatively obscure names oftentimes related to Adolf Hitler .White supremacist members , often with shaved heads and tattoos extolling the Nazi cause , meet periodically at barbeques and concerts that receive little advance publicity .Their music is often filled with lyrics that appeal to alienated individuals .High unemployment caused by the lingering economic recession often fuels resentment , causing groups to lash out at immigrants or others often competing for low - wage jobs .The Sept. 11 , 2011 terrorist attacks caused a backlash against Muslims , and attacks have been reported on Sikhs by people confusing them with Muslims .At the same time that hate groups appear to be on the rise , hate crimes have fallen to a 14-year low , Mr. Levin says .Hate crime homicides are relatively rare .\" The last ten years we 've averaged under a dozen a year , \" Levin says .\" But most years it 's in single digits .\" When they do take place , the odds are good a white supremacist was involved .According to Mark Pitcavage , director of investigative research at the Anti - Defamation League , 85 percent of all extremist - related murders are committed by white supremacists .The most violent group , according to Pitcavage , is the Texas Aryan Brotherhood , which the ADL says has committed at least 29 murders .Even when group members are arrested , they continue operating in prison , Pitcavage says .According to the Houston Chronicle , a four - year statewide investigation by law enforcement into the group resulted in the prosecution of 34 members for murder and racketeering .Another 30 ended up in state prisons .According to Pitcavage , gaining membership in a hate group such as Hammerskins requires a trial period for other members to assess a prospective member .In the case of Page , he appears to have joined the group early in 2011 and became a full - fledged member by late 2011 , Pitcavage says .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"64.061806"}

McCarthy , investigated allegations of subversive elements in the government and the Hollywood film industry .The climate of fear and repression linked to the Red Scare finally began to ease by the late 1950s .Cold War Concerns about Communism .Following World War II ( 1939 - 45 ) , the democratic United States and the communist Soviet Union became engaged in a series of largely political and economic clashes known as the Cold War .The intense rivalry between the two superpowers raised concerns in the United States that Communists and leftist sympathizers inside America might actively work as Soviet spies and pose a threat to U.S. security .Did You Know ?FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was quick to equate any kind of protest with communist subversion , including the civil rights demonstrations led by Martin Luther King Jr. Hoover labeled King a communist and covertly worked to intimidate and discredit the civil rights leader .Such ideas were not totally unfounded .The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) had long carried out espionage activities inside America with the aid of U.S. citizens , particularly during World War II .As apprehension about Soviet influence grew as the Cold War heated up , U.S. leaders decided to take action .On March 21 , 1947 , President Harry S. Truman ( 1884 - 1972 ) issued Executive Order 9835 , also known as the Loyalty Order , which mandated that all federal employees be analyzed to determine whether they were sufficiently loyal to the government .Truman 's loyalty program was a startling development for a country that prized the concepts of personal liberty and freedom of political organization .Yet it was only one of many questionable activities that occurred during the period of anticommunist hysteria known as the Red Scare .Probing Red Influence .One of the pioneering efforts to investigate communist activities took place in the U.S. House of Representatives , where the House Un - American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) was formed in 1938 .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"50.628708"}

{"text":"In a warming climate , all other things will not necessarily be equal .For one thing , wind patterns will probably change , and something called wind shear , which tends to snuff out hurricanes before they can fully form , may increase over the Atlantic as the climate changes .Moreover , some climate scientists argue that a key factor in hurricane formation is not simply the ocean temperature , but the differences in temperature from one ocean basin to another .One recent paper in Science concludes that the overall number of hurricanes in the Atlantic is likely to decrease over the coming century - but that the intensity of those that do happen is likely to increase .Let 's also not forget that while storm surges pose the biggest danger , Irene will almost certainly bring torrential rains to a part of the country that has already been drenched over the past couple of weeks .With saturated ground and a deluge that could add up to 10 or even 20 inches of rain in just a day or so , rivers and creeks will likely overflow their banks , causing widespread flooding .And then there 's the wind , which will inevitably cut power to hundreds of thousands of people , at least ( it can happen even when there is n't a hurricane ) .So this is another potential way that global warming can make hurricanes more destructive - by causing more deluges that can saturate the ground and worsen the flooding caused by a subsequent hurricane ( whose deluge itself was likely worsened by global warming ) .Finally , even without global warming , there are obviously good reasons for increased funding of early warning of hurricanes - which the Republican House has in fact reversed - and for improving the ability of coastal communities to deal with hurricanes .And , because of global warming , there are good reasons to plan for more extreme weather events , which , again , the GOP House bitterly opposes .As long as the Tea Party rules , coastal communities are unlikely to see any significant funding increases for monitoring , planning , resilience , or adaptation .Hurricane season 2005 - -why so active ?This will be my last blog entry until August 12 ; I 'm vacationing far from the tropics ( Yellowstone ! ) to appreciate some mountain weather .Today 's monthly summary of hurricane activity for July issued by the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) states : . \" The month of July saw unprecedented tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic Basin ... with the development of five named storms ...Tropical Storm Cindy ...Hurricane Dennis ...Hurricane Emily ...Tropical Storm Franklin ... and Tropical Storm Gert .The previous record for named storms that formed in July was four .The two major hurricanes that developed during the month tied a record set in 1916 .The July activity follows an unusually active month of June ...And the seven named storms that have formed thus far in 2005 represent a record level of activity for the first two months of the season .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"42.267387"}

{"text":"Obama has staked the credibility of the United States - and his presidency - on his call for a military operation to punish the Syrian government for its alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians last month .But the president faces hardening barriers in Congress , where both Republican critics and Democratic allies have voiced deep reservations or flat opposition to his proposal to intervene militarily in a predominantly Muslim nation after a decade of war overseas .Polls show that much of the American public is skeptical , too .The urgency partly reflects the surprising way that Obama culminated days of deliberation over how to respond to President Bashar al - Assad 's alleged use of chemical weapons , which Obama called \" an assault on human dignity \" that can not go unpunished .He announced Saturday that he would seek congressional approval for any military strike against the Syrian government , and he has struggled to rally support across party lines amid his previously scheduled trip to Sweden and Russia .As of Sept. 4 , lawmakers appear to be tentatively dividing into four camps over military action in Syria .The White House lobbying effort has included direct conversations between Obama or top administration officials and at least 60 senators and at least 125 House members as of Thursday , according to a White House official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration operations .Late Thursday afternoon , Vice President Biden and Antony Blinken , the deputy national security adviser , briefed a bipartisan group of House and Senate members in the White House Situation Room , an administration official said .The outcome of a congressional vote , especially in the Republican­led House , is unclear , and the issue has blurred traditional party lines .White House officials said they are not concerned about the vote trend in Congress so far .They said Obama , who is to return to Washington late Friday , will begin a more public campaign , including perhaps a presidential address , to win support from Congress and the American public for a strike .The full Senate plans to begin considering as early as Friday a resolution authorizing the use of force after a divided Foreign Relations Committee this week backed limited military action .Majority Leader Harry M. Reid ( D - Nev . ) is \" guardedly optimistic \" that the resolution can pass , according to Senate aides .But Sen. Joe Manchin III ( W.Va . ) , a moderate Democrat who has been a bipartisan consensus-­builder , said Thursday that a military strike \" would be the wrong course of action \" before all diplomatic options are exhausted .Here in St. Petersburg , Obama 's quandary over Syria - and his estrangement from the summit 's host and Syria 's key patron , Russian President Vladi­mir Putin - largely overshadowed the economic agenda of the Group of 20 meeting .Obama used the gathering to privately press his G-20 colleagues to support a U.S.-led strike in words , if not resources .He found one possible ally in Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , who Obama said agrees that the Syrian attack should not go unpunished .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"25.850317"}
{"text":"Sound simple ?Perhaps .But think about this .Imagine an ancestral group of hominids with a powerful but unfair and selfish leader who happens to also be bigger and stronger than any of the others in the group ( which is how he got this leadership position in the first place ) .Attacking him physically would be risky ; he can punch harder than you can - remember , he is big and strong .But throwing a rock - well that can smart a bit - doesn't have the same potential costs as close - up physical confrontation .In fact , thrown just right , a rock can kill someone .But the cost to the thrower is , again , small in terms of time and energy .When humans first evolved the ability to accurately throw projectiles in this way , they gained the ability to hold coercive threat over others in an evolutionarily unprecedented manner .Couple this with another aspect of humans that is clearly part of our evolutionary story - the forming of social alliances .Humans are clearly social beings and we often form alliances with others beyond kin lines ( in other words , we form strong alliances and friendships with non - relatives ) .So now imagine a group of three or four males who are smaller than the leader but who form a group , with a vision , of creating a clan ( or society ) that affords them and their families more in the way of power and resources .This small group can be powerful .With shared vision and the ability to accurately throw from a distance , a small group can , in fact , be more powerful than a single large leader .The ability to emit coercive threat from a distance coupled with the proclivity to form significant social alliances may well have given rise to the nature of politics in human groups .In such a scenario , the social playing field can be leveled , and both egalitarianism and democracy can emerge .Our natural tendency , then , may well be democracy .Can the evolutionary approach help us understand the roots of human politics ?I think so .While most often the accusations of \" reductionism \" are wrong in many ways , I think this is too reductionist and may indeed make one grow a beard and light a pipe and mumble \" just so .\" Chimps form just this kind of male alliance and yet they do not have groups defined by culture or any kind of Democracy .There is something more going on .First , hidden estrus is a huge generally ignored factor .This makes the cost of trying to monopolize mating opportunities , the point of being a dominant male , far higher since vigilance must be constant instead of for a few days every month .It also lowers the rewards , since more females will manage to sneak off .Then add in the ability to not just throw stones , but to make stones sharp .Now even a weak male alone who surprises the dominant male can kill them .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"66.39002"}

Boritt ( a historian ) .He stated that \" In colonial times most Americans regarded slavery as a necessary evil .The Founding Fathers of the United States had been unable to abolish slavery and compromised over it in the writing of the Constitution . \"After seeing this comment , I looked at the Constitution , and this is what I found , that indeed there was conflict .Even then , over the queston of slavery and the northern states wanted the power to forbid the foreign slave trade , while the southern delegates did not .A compromise was reached that stated that Congress would not be allowed to regulate the foreign slave trade till 1808 .By the early 1800 's , many Northerners had come to view slavery as wrong .Abolitionists in the North began a movement to end it .Some of this same sentiment existed in the South , however it is said that \" Southerners found slavery to be highly profitable and in time came to consider it a postive good . \"Within this same article it states , \" that even though many of the white Southerners who did not own slaves supported slavery , for they accepted two main ideas that without slavery the South 's economy would collapse and that blacks were inferior to whites .\" In 1858 , Senator William Seward of New York referred to the differences between the North and the South as \" an irrepressible conflict . \"He placed slavery at the heart of that uncontrollable conflict .In fact , it is said that \" debates over slavery raged in Congress between the Northern and Southern lawmakers during most of the 1850 's . \" But like I stated before it goes much deeper than that .It began in colonial times which resulted from the differences in the cultures of people that settled in each as well as from geographical differences .In the South , the climate was found ideal for growing tobacco and other plantation crops .After the plantations were started black slaves were brought here from Africa to provide most of the labor .While up North , the cooler and rocky soil in the north was not suitable for plantations or large farms .As a result of this North became dependent on trade , more than agriculture .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"30.237598"}
