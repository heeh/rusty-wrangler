Bush won in 2000 and 2004 .But I think some people - namely white liberals - are often shocked that a Latino can be anything but a blindly loyal Democrat .A lot of black people are also surprised to find out I do not subscribe to liberalism .I 'm surprised why more black Americans are n't conservative .At the risk of using sweeping generalizations , I do n't think that most people would doubt that blacks and Latinos are people of faith .Latinos pray almost as many times a day as Muslims , and blacks are the only people I know whose voice mail greetings are most likely to tell callers to have \" a blessed day .\" Like the Christian Right and the Republicans who pander to that voting bloc , Latinos and blacks invoke God into their personal lives on a daily basis , and not just when they take the Lord 's name into vain , either .Liberals , on the other hand , are widely regarded as being secular and atheist .Most white college professors are both liberal and secular to the point where they actually look down on people who believe in God .Most white liberals could n't care less that the right wing segment of American media label them as Godless and blame them for everything from the overblown \" war on Christmas \" to an alleged opposition to school prayer ... but Latinos care .While white liberals may enjoy depicting the evangelical Christian community in the U.S. as one operated solely by stereotypical angry white males , most within the mainstream evangelical community know that Latinos make an enormous contribution to their efforts .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"46.78592"}

{"text":"One of the most dispiriting sights of the Wednesday last was the ranks of supine MPs crowding the Commons chamber , silent almost to a man ( and woman ) while their Prime Minister brazenly lied to them .We drew attention to this in our earlier piece , observing that his address to the Commons ( column 927 ) amounted to as clear a lie as has ever been uttered from the lips of a British Prime Minister .He told the House : .Finally , let me be absolutely clear about the legal status of these changes that are now on offer .People said we would never get something that was legally binding - but this plan , if agreed , will be exactly that .These changes will be binding in international law , and will be deposited at the UN .They can not be changed without the unanimous agreement of every EU country - and that includes Britain .So when I said I wanted change that is legally binding and irreversible , that is what I have got .And , in key areas , treaty change is envisaged in these documents .Not only is the idea that the document is legally binding a lie , built into that statement is the essence of a contradiction which proves it to be .Says the Prime Minster , \" in key areas , treaty change is envisaged in these documents \" .To his eternal shame , former Attorney General Dominic Grieve supported the lie , declaring that the Prime Minister had \" achieved a quite remarkable result because of the legally binding nature of the document that he will bring back if it is accepted by the European Council \" .Cash is perfectly correct .The very fact that treaty change is necessary to cement in the provisions of this \" settlement \" means that they can not be binding .And , since no one can guarantee the outcome of treaty negotiations still to be held , nothing dependent on them can be considered binding .Earlier , we even had that noted EU - enthusiast Andrew Duff making his own observations on Mr Cameron 's core claim , which goes back many months .\" If the heads of government want to placate Cameron \" , he wrote , \" they can promise formally to change the treaty in the future , but such a promise will be neither legally - binding , nor irreversible \" .Elaborating on his statement in the Commons , however , Mr Cameron is now insisting that : \" If it [ the settlement ] is agreed it will be agreed as a legally binding treaty deposited at the United Nations \" .Crucially , though , this can not be agreed as an EU treaty .This status is confirmed by the Tusk letter , where the Council President states that : \" Most of the substance of this proposal takes the form of a legally binding Decision of the Heads of State or Governments \" .Notice , he does not state that this is a European Council decision .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"58.593452"}

{"text":"There are six nominees awaiting votes on the Senate floor , and four more nominees will likely be reported out of the Judiciary Committee to the floor tomorrow morning .During the first two years of President Obama 's term , an attitude has developed that the president 's nominees are routinely stalled or filibustered in the Senate , and that there 's nothing that can be done about it .To be sure , the Republican minority in the Senate has launched an unprecedented number of filibusters , and has run out the clock on dozens of nominees .But that 's only part of the story .In today 's New York Times , Jonathan Bernstein looks at whether there 's more that the Obama Administration could be doing .For one thing , the president has named only nine judges for the 17 appeals court vacancies and only 41 judges for the 85 open district court seats .That 's significantly fewer nominations than Presidents George W. Bush or Bill Clinton had sent to Congress by this time in their first terms .Moreover , unlike President Bush , President Obama has not used his bully pulpit to push for Senate confirmation of his nominations .Fairly or not , President Bush regularly lambasted Democrats for blocking an \" up or down \" vote on his nominees .Yet for all the recent chatter about a Republican - fueled judicial crisis , the president rarely speaks about the issue in public , and he did n't mention it in his recent State of the Union address .Of course , even if President Obama follows this course , there 's no guarantee that more judgeships will be filled .Bernstein goes on to highlight ways the Senate 's Democratic majority could smooth the confirmation process and overcome Republican obstruction , and reminds us that Republicans in the Senate were nearly indiscriminate in their efforts to block nominees .Republicans in the Senate should uphold their new commitment to comity by allowing regular votes on nominees .During the last two years , Republicans have regularly used procedural tactics , secret holds , and threats of filibusters to stall , block , or derail dozens of qualified nominees .Bernstein 's op - ed is a reminder that everyone - Senate Democrats , Republicans , the White House , judges , lawyers , reporters , and the general public - needs to take a more active interest in the growing crisis in the judiciary .This morning 's Washington Post ran a front page , above - the - fold article entitled \" Federal judicial vacancies reaching crisis point . \" The Post reported that \" Federal judges have been retiring at a rate of one per week this year , driving up vacancies that have nearly doubled since President Obama took office .The departures are increasing workloads dramatically and delaying trials in some of the nation 's federal courts .The article contains several notable quotes from judges in overburdened districts .Chief Judge Roslyn O.

{"text":"In addition , wave after wave of politicians from all walks of life have attempted to benefit from the legacy of the Kennedy bothers .This election season the ghost of presidents past appears to be Bill Clinton .Of course the link between Obama and Clinton is an interesting one .Recall that Hillary Clinton was the presumptive Democratic candidate in 2008 , only to see her one shot at the presidency usurped by Barack Obama , whose career she has sought to nurture in its early stages .The Clinton 's combined sense of unease at this is understandable and forms the basis for most of the Game Change book , as opposed to the HBO movie , that chose to ignore the Democratic infighting .Equally infuriating to the Clinton 's was the way in which their supporters chose to jump ship to Obama 's banner long before it became apparent that he was guaranteed victory .No defection was more symbolic than that of the Kennedys , whom Bill had courted assiduously during his time in office .Ultimately , Hillary and many former Clinton era officials wound up working for Obama in the White House , in a move that should put pay to the debate to the actor / agency debate in international relations theory .However , Bill Clinton is also being touted by the presumptive Republican Mitt Romney , who is contrasting Clinton 's New Democrat approach with the seemingly Old Democrat mentality of Barack Obama .Speaking in Lansing , Michigan , Romney said of the contrast between Clinton and Obama : . \" President Obama chose to apply liberal ideas of the past to a 21st century America .Liberal policies did n't work then , they have n't worked over the last four years , and they wo n't work in the future .New Democrats had abandoned those policies , but President Obama resurrected them , with predictable results .President Clinton said the era of big government was over .President Obama brought it back with a vengeance .Government at all levels now constitutes 38 % of the economy , and if Obamacare is installed , it will reach almost 50 % .\" President Clinton made efforts to reform welfare as we knew it .President Obama is trying tirelessly to expand the welfare state to all Americans , with promises of more programs , more benefits , and more spending .Now , apparently , he is Mitt Romney 's poster boy for sensible government !All things considered , one can see why Romney would contrast Clinton 's time in office with Obama 's .Consider the economic record of the United States during Clinton 's tenure and the fact that by the 2000 election , the debate was about what to do with the budget surplus !It really is remarkable that Obama has not sought to make more use of Clinton during his first term in his efforts to get the economy back on track .Of course , Bill Clinton is the ex - president who never really went away .An adroit campaigner , Clinton has never strayed from the limelight and appears incapable of yielding the floor to a new generation of politicians and to be honest , why should he ?","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"33.781593"}
{"text":"Kaepernick has actually been fairly good at limiting turnovers throughout his career , as he has now thrown 50 touchdown passes with 21 interceptions .Despite his high - level mobility , Kaepernick fell victim to 42 sacks on the year .The biggest problem with Kaepernick is , while his rushing numbers make him relatively safe , his lack of pass attempts limit his upside .Kaepernick attempted fewer than 30 passes per game .That puts him down with the likes of Blake Bortles , Andy Dalton and Alex Smith .With Michael Crabtree now gone , Kaepernick will have to get comfortable with a new WR2 in Torrey Smith , who joins the team from Baltimore .That could be a blessing in disguise , though , as Crabtree finished with fewer than 700 yards and only four touchdowns this past year .The Daily News has learned that embattled 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick wants out of San Francisco after a forgettable 2015 that included on - field struggles that resulted in a benching midway through the season and a coaching change after it .The Jets are his preferred destination , according to sources .( New York Daily News ) .FFToday 's Take : Even though San Francisco just signed Kaepernick to a new deal last season , the structure of the contract does n't guarantee Kaepernick 's 2016 salary ( 11.9 million ) until April 1st , meaning he could be traded or released .The Jets have stated they are interested in re - signing Ryan Fitzpatrick so this move seems unlikely at this time .Stay tuned ... .The San Francisco 49ers have hired Chip Kelly to be their next head coach , the team announced Thursday .Kelly joins the 49ers after three seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles , whom he led to the playoffs once before being fired with one game remaining in the 2015 season .He was 26 - 21 overall with Philadelphia .Kelly rose to fame for his offensive style during four seasons and a 46 - 7 record as coach at Oregon .( ESPN ) .FFToday 's Take : Many thought Kelly 's time in the NFL had come to close but the former Eagles coach will move to west coast and take over a franchise in a messy situation .The 49ers are coming off a disastrous season that included countless retirements and season - long injuries .Kelly 's hiring may signal life for QB Colin Kaepernick who could become a viable fantasy option in Kelly 's up - tempo offense .The San Francisco 49ers ' head - coaching search has arguably already gone on longer than expected .Now , a new name has either entered or re - entered the picture , depending on which report you 're reading : former Raiders , Broncos and Washington coach Mike Shanahan .Shanahan has been out of the NFL for the last two years , having been fired by Washington prior to the 2014 season .( CBS Sports ) .FFToday 's Take : The 49ers coaching search has covered a lot of ground to this point and it appears Mike Shanahan may get a chance to torment fantasy owners once again .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"42.856575"}

{"text":"Moving that much earth does n't just require a lot of energy .It can also lead to toxic mine drainage , probably the biggest environmental concern associated with gold - mining .When you dig up rock that 's been buried for a long time , air and moisture can set off chemical reactions that produce acids and leach toxic metals .If those substances - sulfuric acid , arsenic and copper , for example - run off into lakes , rivers and streams , they will pose serious risks for populations of fish and other aquatic organisms .Mine drainage is a problem for many kinds of operations , but it 's especially significant for gold extraction .For one thing , gold is often found in rock that contains a lot of acid - generating sulfides ; for another , mining gold produces much more unwanted rock than does mining other minerals .Once you start extracting the gold from the ore , new issues arise .Take mercury , for example .The element , which has been linked to a host of negative health effects , is found in many metal and coal deposits .Large - scale gold operations often start processing ore by roasting it , which can shoot a lot of mercury into the atmosphere .( The same thing happens at coal - burning power plants , the source of about half the United States ' airborne mercury emissions in 2005 . )New pollution control technologies can greatly reduce the emissions from gold roasters .For example , according to University of Nevada environmental science professor Glenn Miller , scrubbers have helped Nevada cut its mercury emissions from more than 20,000 pounds a year a decade ago to just about 4,000 pounds a year .Meanwhile , there 's hope that new treatment processes can also alleviate the serious mercury pollution issues related to small - scale gold - mining in the developing world .According to the EPA , these operations - which produce about one - fifth of the world 's gold - are currently the planet 's No . 1 source of mercury releases to the environment .Whether or not they roast the ore , big mining operations typically finish off the extraction process by dousing the ore in cyanide .Cyanide is extremely lethal , but as an environmental contaminant it 's not as problematic as mercury , since it degrades fairly quickly .( Mercury sticks around forever . )Some of the byproducts of that degradation process , such as nitrates , may contaminate groundwater , but a bigger issue is that the use of cyanide allows mining companies to go after very low - grade ore .That means they end up digging up more earth to produce the same amount of gold , which produces huge amounts of tailings , the material that 's left over once the ore has been processed .Gold tailing ponds and piles are chock - full of contaminants such as arsenic , antimony , residual cyanide and mercury , and so must be carefully managed to avoid generating runoff or coming into contact with wildlife .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"28.859386"}

Orange Street .General Assembly Weekend Check - In .Three major , and controversial , decisions have been made in the North Carolina General Assembly this past weekend : the Senate 's new spending plan , teacher pay raises , and the fracking bill .The Senate has decided upon a new $ 21.1 billion spending plan for 2014 - 15 this weekend .Democrats were displeased with how quickly the decision was made , as it allowed for minimal negotiation .They seemed to be in consensus that the Senate was only interested in hearing their own approval , rather than the perspectives of the general public .As part of this new budget plan , legislators also desire to encourage teachers to give up their tenure in exchange for an 11 % raise in pay .Teachers , in response , are disagreeing with the motion as they desire more protection from unfriendly politics that surround schools presently .These raises are also planned to be gathered from cuts that would come from public school spending .Other states are allegedly not attempting this swap of pay raise for tenure .Democrats agree that this action is not for the benefit of the teacher 's , but more of a cover - up for legislators ' inability to manage money wisely .The fracking bill , completely supported by the House Republicans , is now on its way to be signed by Gov. Pat McCrory , who is more than ready to help get it passed .While Democrats were clearly unhappy with the bill , they failed to halt the process .Instead , they were able to add a few minor alterations to the bill as compromise before being sent to Gov. McCrory .Many North Carolinians fear what the fracking might mean for chemicals that could get into well water , as well as how the Senate now seems to have the ability to override local governments in relation to how the fracking will be carried out .As of now , there seems to be a great deal of controversy with each major decision processed by the General Assembly of North Carolina this past weekend .The uncertainty regarding the decided amount of the budget has some questioning how things are going to get better now .The risky move of raising teachers ' salaries whilst eliminating assistants and tenure is causing a rift of displeasure from educators of North Carolina , and unfavorable fracking plans that may affect local businesses in a way that they are unwilling to comply with the Senate 's decision .Local Electeds React To State Senate Budget .The North Carolina General Assembly is meeting in \" short session \" this year - but there 's been no shortness of controversy .Already facing a multi - million - dollar shortfall , officials at Chapel Hill - Carrboro City Schools say the Senate 's proposal would likely force the district to make even more cuts than they were initially planning - unless they can persuade County Commissioners to dig even deeper into the pool of local money .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"46.710403"}

{"text":"But from the social network 's point of view , the main benefit is that it keeps people inside Facebook , because there 's effectively no option to click and go somewhere else .The spider and the fly .In fact , according to the Wall Street Journal , in some cases you ca n't include a link to the website that published the story even if you want to .Since the Washington Post publishes 100 % of its content through the Facebook Instant Articles feature - a somewhat controversial strategy - if you try to link to a story on the Post website , it winds up getting converted into a link to the Instant Article .According to both the New York Times and Facebook itself , the initial results show that Instant Articles get shared a lot more than the more traditional kind of post that has an excerpt from a story and a link .Because the posts load quickly , it 's more likely people will read and share them , Facebook product manager Michael Reckhow pointed out in a recent interview with the Nieman Journalism Lab .That 's good for Facebook FB , since it means more engagement , which is the whole reason why they are reaching out to publishers in the first place .And theoretically it 's a good idea for the media outlets that are participating , because their content is being shared more widely and they are reaching more people .The almighty algorithm .But do publishers lose out because their articles and videos live completely inside Facebook ?The social network argues they do n't , because they get to sell the same advertising as they would on their own site , or they can share the revenue from Facebook 's ads ( Twitter does n't share revenue from Moments , at least not yet ) .And the traffic that occurs with Instant Articles is treated the same by audience measurement firms like Omniture , as though it was on their own site .So where is the downside ?The risk is that since news consumption occurs entirely inside Facebook , the social network becomes the default source of news for large numbers of people , and they eventually stop associating that news with the outlet that actually created it .There 's already some evidence that this is happening .On top of that , because Facebook controls the algorithm that determines what users see or do n't see , then it gets to decide what the news is , and what is important .And that 's a potential problem if Facebook chooses to delete disturbing images or news stories about war and promote peaceful happy stories instead .In some cases , information disappears from Facebook and the social network never explains why .Should we mourn the hyperlink ?More broadly though , is the death of the hyperlink something we should be concerned about ?Does it matter that growing numbers of users , particularly on mobile devices , never actually go to the source of the news they are reading ?Many people never clicked on links even before mobile and the social web came along , either because they were lazy or because they did n't have time to go any deeper .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"43.701218"}

( WHNT)- An Alabama lawmaker is proposing chemically castrating those convicted of sex related offenses .The Times Daily in Florence reports that Representative Steve Hurst of Munford will propose a bill again in 2014 that would require those convicted of sex crimes against children to be chemically castrated before being released from prison .Hurst 's bill would apply to those over the age of 21 who 's victims were 12 and under .I would say yes , but most children that are molested , are molested with parts of a molesters body that can not be castrated .If they could find a drug to castrate the part of the brain that makes them perverted , that would be wonderful .I think the death penalty should apply to all crimes no matter how serious .I think sexism in any form should be a crime .If we 're to castrate male sex offenders , then female sex offender ( yes , they 're out there ) should have their ovaries ripped out .While castration may be gaining a new round of attention , it should not be seen as a viable solution .Castration harkens back to historical controversies like genocide , ethic cleansing , and Eugenics , laws that were not completely overturned but fell out of favor as Draconian measures .Short - term \" cost - saving \" would simply be countered by long term health problems associated with castration without guaranteeing elimination of motivation for committing sex crimes in the first place .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"32.83504"}

( CBS ATLANTA ) - An Alabama legislator has re - introduced a bill to legalize castration of convicted child molesters if their victims were under the age of 12 - and make them pay for the procedure .The Florence Times Daily reports that Rep. Steve Hurst ( R - Munford ) is proposing the bill for the 2014 legislative session , which begins in January .Hurst attempted to push this bill during the 2013 session , but it did not make it out of committee .Under Rep. Hurst 's proposed legislation , convicted sex offenders over the age of 21 would be castrated prior to their release from prison if their victims were under the age of 12 years old .The castration would also be financed by the sex offender , and not by the correctional system , reports WFSB .A CNN report from 2012 notes that at least nine states : including California , Florida , Georgia , Iowa Louisiana , Montana , Oregon , Texas and Wisconsin already have versions of \" chemical castration \" in their laws .Such a process involves the administering of chemicals to take away sexual interest and make it impossible for the person to perform sexual acts .The Alabama legislation does not detail the castration process to be used in the proposed bill .The use of chemical castration remains controversial , with the practice being called \" inhuman treatment \" by Amnesty International .\" At first sight , forced chemical castration could be taken as a matter - of - course decision ; however , it is incompatible with human rights , which are the foundation of any civilized democratic society , \" Amnesty International wrote in its March statement .According to his legislature website , Rep.

Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he was suspending New York 's participation in a federal immigration enforcement plan that has drawn fire from immigrant advocates , civil liberties lawyers and elected officials in the state and around the country .A statement from Mr. Cuomo 's office said there was \" mounting evidence \" that the program , called Secure Communities , had not only failed to meet its goal of deporting the most serious immigrant criminals but was also undermining law enforcement and compromising public safety .\" There are concerns about the implementation of the program as well as its impact on families , immigrant communities and law enforcement in New York , \" Mr. Cuomo said .Unless those concerns are eased , the statement said , New York will not take part .Mr. Cuomo 's decision makes New York the second state to announce its intention to withdraw from the program , and sets up a confrontation with the Obama administration , which has made Secure Communities a cornerstone of immigration enforcement strategy .Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois said in May that he was canceling his state 's participation .Under the program , begun by the Bush administration in 2008 , the fingerprints of everyone booked into a local or county jail are sent to the Department of Homeland Security and compared with prints in its files .If officials find that a suspect is in the country illegally , or is a noncitizen with a criminal record , they may seek to deport the person .By Wednesday , that fingerprint sharing had been introduced in about 41 percent of the nation 's jurisdictions , including 27 of 62 counties in New York .Mr. Cuomo 's move means that those counties ' participation will end .The entire country is scheduled to join the program by 2013 .The practical effects of Mr. Cuomo 's decision are unclear .New York law enforcement agencies regularly check fingerprints with the Federal Bureau of Investigation .Homeland Security officials said that regardless of New York 's participation in Secure Communities , the F.B.I. would still share fingerprints with the immigration agency .Federal officials said that if states did not share fingerprints with the F.B.I. , those states would lose access to federal criminal databases , undermining their ability to fight crime .While Secure Communities has contributed to a sharp rise in deportations under President Obama , it does not appear to have won him many allies .It has angered immigrants who supported Democrats in recent elections .It has also failed to convince many of the president 's Republican opponents that he is sufficiently committed to enforcement .Opponents of the program contend that even though it was mainly intended to ensnare convicted criminals and people deemed a security threat , it has instead caught too many immigrants charged with low - level crimes or guilty only of being in the country illegally .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"47.21431"}

'Ms Suleaman replied : ' I do n't think I needed to . 'Ms Suleaman said : ' I got the sense that he was already talking to the police . 'She added : ' I referred it to my immediate boss at the BBC .I was n't told that there was an obligation .I obviously had to report back to my immediate manager at the BBC .In fact it was referred above her as well .It was such a big story .At one stage the head of news at the BBC was involved .No one at any stage said there was an obligation . 'Miss Suleaman also told Mr Penny , that Hamid , who she dubbed ' a documentary - maker 's dream ' , was taken on a paintballing trip for the programme as a fun way of introducing him .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"69.74308"}

{"text":"Experts say white supremacist groups are on the rise , fueled by a bad economy and the election of a black president .By Ron Scherer , Staff Writer , Kevin Loria , Contributor / August 6 , 2012 .The deadly shooting at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee is renewing concern about the white supremacist movement in the United States , which experts say is on the rise in large part because of the weak economy and a visceral distrust among some people of the first African - American president .Wade Michael Page , who gunned down six people Sunday before being shot and killed by police , was a member of a hardcore rock band that was part of underground movement featuring racist ideologies and he had coded racist tattoos .Police have not released any details as to Mr. Page 's motivations .Despite the increase in the number of hate groups , however , it is relatively rare for their vitriol to result in actual violence , experts say .Instead , their invective shows up on website chat rooms and in social media like Facebook and Twitter , using relatively obscure names oftentimes related to Adolf Hitler .White supremacist members , often with shaved heads and tattoos extolling the Nazi cause , meet periodically at barbeques and concerts that receive little advance publicity .Their music is often filled with lyrics that appeal to alienated individuals .High unemployment caused by the lingering economic recession often fuels resentment , causing groups to lash out at immigrants or others often competing for low - wage jobs .The Sept. 11 , 2011 terrorist attacks caused a backlash against Muslims , and attacks have been reported on Sikhs by people confusing them with Muslims .At the same time that hate groups appear to be on the rise , hate crimes have fallen to a 14-year low , Mr. Levin says .Hate crime homicides are relatively rare .\" The last ten years we 've averaged under a dozen a year , \" Levin says .\" But most years it 's in single digits .\" When they do take place , the odds are good a white supremacist was involved .According to Mark Pitcavage , director of investigative research at the Anti - Defamation League , 85 percent of all extremist - related murders are committed by white supremacists .The most violent group , according to Pitcavage , is the Texas Aryan Brotherhood , which the ADL says has committed at least 29 murders .Even when group members are arrested , they continue operating in prison , Pitcavage says .According to the Houston Chronicle , a four - year statewide investigation by law enforcement into the group resulted in the prosecution of 34 members for murder and racketeering .Another 30 ended up in state prisons .According to Pitcavage , gaining membership in a hate group such as Hammerskins requires a trial period for other members to assess a prospective member .In the case of Page , he appears to have joined the group early in 2011 and became a full - fledged member by late 2011 , Pitcavage says .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"64.061806"}

{"text":"Of course , it is not politically correct or media correct to mention the name of Jesus Christ too much , but it is more acceptable to discuss the teachings of Islam openly .This , too , in itself , is another form of Christian persecution .As a result of the trends of persecution in America , Christian persecution is on the rise .It can be viewed throughout the complete spectrum of the American society , not just the public education system .As a result , there are several things that Christians can expect to happen in the future .First , as has already started , the governments of the world , including the United States , are gradually denying Christians the same privileges as other religious groups .Christians who preach against life styles that the Bible classifies as sin and an abomination to God will face many kinds of fear that will cause much stress for them .The different kinds of fear would be : .Fear of being arrested 2 .Fear of being associated with radicals 3 .Fear of being seen as unloving 4 .Fear of getting a bad reputation 5 .Fear of government scrutiny 6 .However , as stated in the Bible , Christians will have to deal with fear and persecution in their lives on a regularly basis during the end times .But , at the same time , Christians should not sit idly by and do nothing about it .They should form some type of legislative agenda of their own , an agenda that would bring America back to its Christian roots .Of course , a great spiritual awakening would be even better .Finally , new words to describe Bible - believing Christians are being introduced into the American society , too .And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another .Therefore , if Christians are going to fight against the cohorts of Satan , they must first make sure that the God who they represent is with them in the battles that lie ahead .As happened too often to the Israelites , they would be led into captivity when they failed to serve God .When they returned to God , He always brought them out of captivity .If American Christians do not truly return to their God and Savior , and rekindle a personal relationship with Him , they will not be able to spiritually stand when the persecution that awaits them arrives .It will bring them to their knees in agony .But , if they have their God on their side , they will be victorious over religious persecution in America .Why do Atheists tend to bash Christianity but give excuses for Islam ? ?Jesus Christ as a symbol ( whether he was a real person or not ) is a much better role model than the child molesting , murderous , and evil \" prophet \" called Muhammad .The Bible does n't demand governments to be Christian but the Quran demands that all governments be Islamic by nature and the punishments are much more bizarre .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"38.32294"}

{"text":"Should the reality of Communist espionage cause us to reassess our views of McCarthyism in America ?Many Americans today are critical of the anticommunist hysteria of the 1950s , decrying the systematic violation of civil liberties inherent in the anticommunist inquisition .But - considering the fact that some American Communists were , in fact , spying for the Soviets , and that McCarthyite proceedings did lead to convictions of real Soviet spies - is it possible that legitimate Cold War ends justified regrettable McCarthyite means ?Red Scare .Introduction .As the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States intensified in the late 1940s and early 1950s , hysteria over the perceived threat posed by Communists in the U.S. became known as the Red Scare .( Communists were often referred to as \" Reds \" for their allegiance to the red Soviet flag . )The Red Scare led to a range of actions that had a profound and enduring effect on U.S. government and society .Federal employees were analyzed to determine whether they were sufficiently loyal to the government , and the House Un - American Activities Committee , as well as U.S. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , investigated allegations of subversive elements in the government and the Hollywood film industry .The climate of fear and repression linked to the Red Scare finally began to ease by the late 1950s .Cold War Concerns about Communism .Following World War II ( 1939 - 45 ) , the democratic United States and the communist Soviet Union became engaged in a series of largely political and economic clashes known as the Cold War .The intense rivalry between the two superpowers raised concerns in the United States that Communists and leftist sympathizers inside America might actively work as Soviet spies and pose a threat to U.S. security .Did You Know ?FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was quick to equate any kind of protest with communist subversion , including the civil rights demonstrations led by Martin Luther King Jr. Hoover labeled King a communist and covertly worked to intimidate and discredit the civil rights leader .Such ideas were not totally unfounded .The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) had long carried out espionage activities inside America with the aid of U.S. citizens , particularly during World War II .As apprehension about Soviet influence grew as the Cold War heated up , U.S. leaders decided to take action .On March 21 , 1947 , President Harry S. Truman ( 1884 - 1972 ) issued Executive Order 9835 , also known as the Loyalty Order , which mandated that all federal employees be analyzed to determine whether they were sufficiently loyal to the government .Truman 's loyalty program was a startling development for a country that prized the concepts of personal liberty and freedom of political organization .Yet it was only one of many questionable activities that occurred during the period of anticommunist hysteria known as the Red Scare .Probing Red Influence .One of the pioneering efforts to investigate communist activities took place in the U.S. House of Representatives , where the House Un - American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) was formed in 1938 .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"50.628708"}

{"text":"Speaking at a university graduation ceremony in Jericho , Abbas stated that the borders of the Palestinian state would stretch from the Dead Sea in the south and through the Jordan Valley all the way up to the town of Bet She'an in the north .This is a Palestinian - Jordanian border and that is how it will remain , \" Abbas said .\" The responsibility for security along the border will be in the hands of the Palestinians .Abbas 's remarks came in wake of leaks by Palestinian officials to the effect that at the current US - sponsored secret peace negotiations , Israel is demanding full control over the border with Jordan in any peace settlement with the Palestinians .Israel , of course , has its own reasons for refusing to cede control over the strategic Jordan Valley .Israel 's main concern is that the border with Jordan will be used by Palestinian terror groups and Islamist fundamentalist organizations to smuggle weapons and terrorists into the West Bank and Israel .However , there 's another reason why Israel remains strongly opposed to surrendering control over its border with Jordan to the Palestinian Authority or a third party .It is no secret that the Jordanians have long been worried about the repercussions of the presence of Palestinians on their border .In a recent closed briefing with a high - ranking Jordanian security official , he was asked about the kingdom 's position regarding the possibility that Palestinians might one day replace Israel along the border with Jordan .May God forbid ! \" the official retorted .\" We have repeatedly made it clear to the Israeli side that we will not agree to the presence of a third party at our border .The official explained that Jordan 's stance was not new .\" This has been our position since 1967 , \" he said .\"The late King Hussein made this clear to all Israeli governments and now His majesty , King Abdullah , remains committed to this position .Jordan 's opposition to placing the border crossings with the West Bank under Palestinian control is not only based on security concerns .Of course , Jordan 's security concerns are not unjustified , especially in light of what has been happening over the past few years along the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt .The Egyptians are now paying a heavy price for neglecting their shared border with the Gaza Strip over the past few decades .This lapse has seen Sinai emerge as a hotbed for Al - Qaeda - linked terror groups that are now posing a serious threat to Egypt 's national security .Besides the security concerns , the Jordanians are also worried about the demographic implications of Palestinian security and civilian presence over the border .Their worst nightmare , as a veteran Jordanian diplomat once told Israeli colleagues during a private encounter , is that once the Palestinians are given control over the border , thousands of them from the future Palestinian state would pour into Jordan .The Jordanians already have a \" problem \" with the fact that their kingdom 's population consists of a Palestinian majority , which some say has reached over 80 % .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"31.190052"}

Comey , a high - ranking Justice Department official during the George W. Bush administration , to replace FBI Director Robert Mueller III , whose already extended 10-year term expires in September .Comey is a former hedge fund executive , the former top lawyer for defense contractor Lockheed Martin , and a Republican .Why would Obama pick him for such a high - profile job ?Right , \" everyone knows that nominating a Democrat to run the FBI would be an intolerable provocation , \" says Kevin Drum at Mother Jones , sarcastically .But more to the point , if Obama actually believes that \" nominating Comey will be seen as some kind of bipartisan olive branch , he 's crazy .\" It 's certainly true that \" Chuck Hagel 's prior service as a Republican senator from Nebraska did not spare him from a bruising nomination battle for secretary of defense , \" note Sari Horwitz and Peter Finn at The Washington Post .But there 's another reason to suspect that \" Comey 's Senate confirmation wo n't necessarily be a breeze , \" says Garrett M.

{"text":"Is it true that there are bills in the House and Senate that will exempt members and their staff and families from buying into Obamacare ? FULL ANSWER .Several readers have asked us about Congress attempting to exempt itself from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act .A few said that a Facebook post claimed that President Barack Obama , Sen. Harry Reid and Democrats in Congress were trying to \" get themselves exempted from Obamacare , \" in the words of one reader .But there is no bill in Congress calling for an exemption from the health care law .In fact , members of Congress and their staffs face additional requirements that most Americans do n't have to meet .Under the health care law , their insurance coverage will have to switch from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program , the group of private insurance plans that cover 8 million federal employees and retirees , to the exchanges created by the law .Those exchanges are meant for those who buy coverage on their own , the currently uninsured and small businesses .Members of Congress and their staffs would be the only employees of a large employer in the exchanges , which are set to begin offering insurance in January .So , why is the false \" exempt \" claim making the Facebook rounds ?There is reportedly concern on Capitol Hill that the Office of Personnel Management , which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program , wo n't be able to smoothly transition members and their staffs into an exchange .The concern , as a Roll Call story explained , was that the government would n't be able to make contributions toward the federal employees ' premiums , at least at the beginning of 2014 .That would mean employees would pick up the whole tab for their insurance policies .Right now , the government pays 72 percent of premiums on average .The \" exempt \" claims were sparked by a Politico report on April 24 that said secret talks were being held by lawmakers to change the requirement to get insurance through the exchanges because of this concern .The headline on the story said \" Lawmakers , aides may get Obamacare exemption . \"After the story was published , a spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid said there had n't been any discussions to exempt Congress from \" provisions that apply to any employees of any other public or private employer offering health care . \"And Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California told Politico that lawmakers and their staffs will indeed get insurance through the exchanges .\" [ T]he federal government will offer them health insurance coverage that they obtained through the exchanges because we want to get the same health care coverage everybody else has available to them , \" he said .We contacted the Office of Personnel Management and received this statement from an administration official : \" Members of Congress will not receive anything that is not available to the public .The law does n't allow them to get insurance from FEHB , they are going to get insurance on the market place , just like uninsured individuals and small businesses .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"31.91697"}

John McCain , but some Hispanics have become disillusioned with Obama because of his failure to deliver on promises to overhaul immigration policy .Obama , who visited as a candidate in May 2008 , sought to assure his Puerto Rican listeners they were not forgotten by his administration .In remarks at an arrival event at the airport in San Juan , Obama quickly turned to the decades - old debate about the island 's status , which has some pushing for statehood or even independence .The president reaffirmed his support for a referendum in which island voters would resolve the matter for themselves , eliciting cheers when he said : \" When the people of Puerto Rico make a clear decision , my administration will stand by you .\" The words could resonate not just here but with the millions of Puerto Rican voters on the mainland , including more than 800,000 in politically important Florida , where Obama stayed overnight Monday before flying here Tuesday morning .Democrats see the Puerto Ricans in Florida as a potential counterbalance to the larger , traditionally Republican Cuban - American community in a state Obama needs to win a second term .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"46.73799"}

Reid ( D - Nev . ) is \" guardedly optimistic \" that the resolution can pass , according to Senate aides .But Sen.

W. Bush came of age well before the 1960s , the younger Bush shared this nostalgia as a kind of cultural legacy .All three promised to restore to public life the virtues supposedly lost through the misguided policies of the \" bad sixties .\" While a young George W.

{"text":"Under Umar 's authority , Arab armies in Egypt invaded Black Africa to the south and attempted to conquer the Christian Makurians who were living there peacefully .Although the Muslims were held off , the Makurians had to sign a treaty to prevent recurring invasions .The terms of the Baqt included an annual payment of 360 \" high quality \" African slaves .The treaty stood for 700 years with no mention of the slightest opposition from generations of Muslim clerics and scholars .Umar himself was stabbed to death by a slave whose liberty he refused to grant .In this case , the slave was captured during the campaign against a Persia , one of many offensive wars waged by the Muslims against people who were not attacking them .Modern day apologists trying to defend slavery under Islam generally ignore the basic fact that reducing people to property is dehumanizing .They distract from this by comparing the theoretical treatment of slaves under Sharia with the worst examples of abuse from the era of European slavery .( \" Fatwa 64 from ISIS instructs slave owners to \" show compassion \" and \" kindness \" to the women they rape . )The first problem with this is that the actual practice of Muslim slavery was often remarkably at odds with the relatively humane treatment prescribed by Sharia .For example , according to the Ghanan scholar John Azumah , nearly three times as many captured Africans died in harsh circumstances related to their transport to Muslim lands than were ever even enslaved by Europeans .A more insurmountable problem for the Muslim apologist who insists that slavery is \" different \" under Islam are the many examples in which Muhammad and his companions sold captured slaves to non - Muslim traders for material goods .The welfare of the slave was obviously of no consequence .Some contemporary apologists interpret sex slavery as a favor done to the subject - a way in which women and children are taken care of in exchange for their sexual availability to the pious Muslim male .Although morally repugnant in its own right , this is easily belied by the fact that slavery would be unnecessary if the arrangement were of benefit to the slave .Another myth about Islamic slavery is that it was not race - based .It was .Muhammad 's father - in - law , Umar , in his aforementioned role as caliph , declared that Arabs could not be taken as slaves and even had all Arab slaves freed on his deathbed .This helped propel the vast Islamic campaign to capture slaves in Africa , Europe and Asia for import into the Middle East .The greatest slave rebellion in human history took place in Basra , Iraq beginning in 869 .A half - million African slaves staged a courageous uprising against their Arab - Islamic masters that lasted fifteen years before being brutally suppressed .( See Zanj Rebellion ) .Literally millions of Christians were captured into slavery during the many centuries of Jihad .So pervasive were the incursions by the Turks into Eastern Europe , that the English word for slave is based on Slav .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"34.921196"}

{"text":"Why did they ?The reasons and the causes of this war are not dried cut .There would be more than one reason , more than one cause , with slavery being one of them , and the preservation of the Union being another .But is was more than that , much more than that .This was a war of passion , a war of principles , a war that would tear away at the heart and soul of this county , and of the individual .Let us look at these reasons again , what could cause this type of division ? ?However , it even goes deeper than that .Let us first concentrate on the issue of slavery , and reflect on some comments made by Gabor S. Boritt ( a historian ) .He stated that \" In colonial times most Americans regarded slavery as a necessary evil .The Founding Fathers of the United States had been unable to abolish slavery and compromised over it in the writing of the Constitution . \"After seeing this comment , I looked at the Constitution , and this is what I found , that indeed there was conflict .Even then , over the queston of slavery and the northern states wanted the power to forbid the foreign slave trade , while the southern delegates did not .A compromise was reached that stated that Congress would not be allowed to regulate the foreign slave trade till 1808 .By the early 1800 's , many Northerners had come to view slavery as wrong .Abolitionists in the North began a movement to end it .Some of this same sentiment existed in the South , however it is said that \" Southerners found slavery to be highly profitable and in time came to consider it a postive good . \"Within this same article it states , \" that even though many of the white Southerners who did not own slaves supported slavery , for they accepted two main ideas that without slavery the South 's economy would collapse and that blacks were inferior to whites .\" In 1858 , Senator William Seward of New York referred to the differences between the North and the South as \" an irrepressible conflict . \"He placed slavery at the heart of that uncontrollable conflict .In fact , it is said that \" debates over slavery raged in Congress between the Northern and Southern lawmakers during most of the 1850 's . \" But like I stated before it goes much deeper than that .It began in colonial times which resulted from the differences in the cultures of people that settled in each as well as from geographical differences .In the South , the climate was found ideal for growing tobacco and other plantation crops .After the plantations were started black slaves were brought here from Africa to provide most of the labor .While up North , the cooler and rocky soil in the north was not suitable for plantations or large farms .As a result of this North became dependent on trade , more than agriculture .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"30.237598"}

{"text":"A very common accusation by white Southerners , especially secessionists , was that the free states had somehow or other changed / violated the balancing of interests created in the Constitution .However , IMHO , it was the inclusion of a massive territory in which slavery was firmly established that irretrievably altered the balance .The Constitution had given the slave states the federal ratio on representation but the first Congress under the Constitution ratified the Northwest Ordinance , passed by the Articles of Confederation Congress , banning slavery from the old NW territory .There were clearly free states , states starting the road to emancipation , and potential free states ( Vermont ) waiting in the wings when the Constitution was draftey.d and ratified .The first truly major crisis over slavery occurred over the creation and admission of states out of the territories brought into the US by the Louisiana Purchase and resulted in the Missouri Compromise .It was the trashing of the Missouri Compromise by the Compromise of 1850 creating the potential for slavery to expand into territories previously closed to it that and resulting in the Kansas - Nebraska Act and the new Fugitive Slave Law that heated up matters considerabl .IMHO , the critical error that pro - slavery forces made was in misjudging how far they could push Northern whites .Most northern whites did not appear to like slavery all that much , but , so long as it did not impinge on their lives in any significant way , they were quite happy to leave the whole issue to God , fate , whatever .You make a point that is deeply ironic .Although , states ' rights was not a novel concept , the fervor for secession gained fervor as the slave states saw themselves losing control of the federal government .I think one thing that does need to be asked is what more the free states could have done to assuage the feelings of the Southern whites ?What the Southerns who lead the secession movement wanted from the North was a trustworthy and believable assurance that slavery have a safe future in the Union .After all , they felt , the Constitution itself protected slavery .And the Supreme Court in Dred Scott had just reiterated that point .But the South could not get a trustworthy commitment that slavery was safe in the Union .Abolitionists like Seward and Chase wanted slavery terminated as soon as practicabe .But talk of \" ultimate extinction \" scared the hell out of the South .First , the right in property in slaves constituted a gigantic investment of capital .And slaves were an integral part of the cotton - export industry which was at that time still the biggest export money - maker America had ever known .Anything that hinted at ultimate extinction immediately hit the value of those assets .Second , and I think this fact is often overlooked , slavery was a social system that ordered the relationships between whites and blacks .In this regard , it is important to remember that , back in 1861 , almost all of the blacks in the U.S.A. lived in the South .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"33.26648"}

Scott Pruitt filed a petition asking the US Supreme Court to review the Oklahoma Supreme Court 's decision to strike down that state 's law .JURIST Guest Columnist Stephanie Toti argues that the injunction against the previously discussed Oklahoma law helps protect women 's access to medical care : . \"Had the Oklahoma law been allowed to take effect , it would have threatened women 's continued access to abortion in a state where onerous legal burdens and intimidation by anti - choice extremists have already whittled the number of licensed abortion providers down to three .Moreover , it would have demeaned women , embodying a presumption that women are not capable of making informed medical decisions independently .The law would have enabled the State , and certain obstetricians , to control the information that a woman receives about her pregnancy - forcing some women to receive information that they consider irrelevant and preventing others from receiving information that they would consider crucial . \"International Abortion Restrictions .T he Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 did not contain a provision for reproductive rights , but the United Nations approved the Proclamation of Teheran in 1968 at the World Conference for Human Rights , which defined reproductive rights as human rights .The UN also included full access to reproductive health services as part of its Millennium Development Goals to be accomplished by 2015 .Many European countries , such as Italy , Germany , France , Spain and Portugal , restrict abortion more than the US , forbidding it after 14 weeks of pregnancy .Despite some restrictions , European countries largely allow [ PDF ] for abortions where the mother 's life or health is in danger , in cases of rape or incest , for socioeconomic reasons and on request .Latin American countries enforce [ PDF ] some of the world 's most stringent anti - abortion laws , in addition to the world 's highest rates of unsafe abortions .There are signs that changes are imminent , with the consideration in March 2007 of the decriminalization of abortion in Mexico City for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy .Colombia has eased its absolute abortion ban , the Argentina Supreme Court ruled that rape victims should not be prevented from opting for abortion and Uruguay in October 2012 passed a bill to legalize abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy after years of bills and vetoes .However , in May 2013 , the Supreme Court of El Salvador refused to reconsider that country 's complete ban on abortions , despite international urging to do so .The Court denied the request of doctors to perform a therapeutic abortion on a woman pregnant with a fetus developing without a brain where the woman 's life was threatened by kidney failure and lupus symptoms aggravated by her pregnancy .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"57.26712"}

{"text":"Histories of the Chicano and feminist movements have failed to fully record the vital forms of Chicana political consciousness and organizing that existed in this period .While there are many other sources of Chicana feminist consciousness and organizing projects that need to be more fully documented , the story of Anna NietoGomez and members of Las Hijas de Cuauhtémoc is a significant thread in the multilayered struggle around gender and sexuality in el movimiento .Although they were a small organization , their impact as one of the first organizations to explicitly call for and theorize Chicana feminism was paramount .Their ideas informed the terrain of struggle across movement sectors , reached into gendered discussions in other regions , and gave other women and men who believed in gender equity within the broader project of Chicano liberation a vehicle for speaking out .While their work was vital within the student movement , they were also part of a broader mobilization of movement women in the greater Los Angeles region that included the East Los Angeles Chicana Welfare Rights Organization and the Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional .While this history bursts with telling , it has been also been a challenging one to tell because it makes us reconsider the limited ( and limiting ) conventions of writing history .He argues that we engage \" simultaneously in the sociohistorical process and in narrative constructions about that process . \"8 Further , he argues : .What matters most are the process and conditions of production of such narratives .Only a focus on that process can uncover the ways in which the two sides of historicity intertwine in a particular context .Only through the overlap can we discover the differential exercise of power that makes some narratives possible and silences others.9 .It is not enough to say , \" The women were there , too . \"To subvert the ideologies of these official histories , we must overturn the epistemological register that licenses them .Because the add and stir method is not sufficient , this project proposes an alternative historiographic framework for understanding women 's social movements .Illustrating that history is more than just a narrative of the past , it examines how memory circulates in popular culture and produces and maintains political identities and the boundaries of what is politically possible today .It locates the contributions of the Hijas de Cuauhtémoc within the development of Chicana feminism in relation to other organizations and contextualizes their interventions in regional , cross - regional , and national developments .And it reveals the unprecedented shifts in gendered consciousness and political subjectivity that resulted from women 's participation in the Chicano movement .The architecture of this book builds on the historical importance of the women I interviewed and the knowledge collectively produced in their oral histories .I begin to introduce them to you here in this prelude so that through their stories you can hear the distortions in the historical record .As in music , this prelude functions as more than just an introduction to the historical record .It sets the soundscape and signals the major riffs and musical samples of those narratives of the Chicano movement .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"21.442286"}
{"text":"Many of their families were displaced by the massive waves of migration brought on by the Mexican Revolution or were shaped by labor histories and the busts and booms of U.S. capitalism that have circumscribed the life chances of Mexicanos in the United States .This story interweaves the rich oral histories of Chicana activists and organizers and is deeply rooted in the oral history of Anna NietoGomez .Many histories of women of color are often told through , and thus structured by , the historiographic practices that have created silences about them .We recognize that we are oppressed as Raza and as women .We believe that the struggle is not with the male but with the existing system of oppression .But the Chicano must also be educated to the problems and oppression of La Chicana so that he may not be used as a tool to divide by keeping man against woman .\" Our Philosophy , \" Las Hijas de Cuauhtémoc ( 1971 ) .As one of the first explicitly feminist Chicana political groups in the Chicano movement , the Hijas de Cuauhtémoc emerged within the ranks of the United Mexican American Students ( UMAS ) at California State University , Long Beach , in 1968 .After the historic 1969 Plan de Santa Barbara UMAS , along with other youth organizations and student groups , united under the name el Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán ( MEChA ) .Ironically , the focus of these educational meetings quickly shifted from imparting political knowledge to addressing issues that were emerging from the women 's experience in the movement .Eventually these meetings provided a vehicle for discussing internal sexual politics , as well as a space for naming the issues affecting working - class Chicanas that were not being addressed in Chicano student movement organizations .Chicana activists began to speak about the conditions of their lives ; to analyze how they were positioned by multiple and interlocking oppressions of race , class , and gender ; and to understand the collective issues faced by women entering the university for the first time .A growing critique emerged that centered on the gap between the movement 's rhetoric on equal rights and the ways in which women were treated not as equal social and political actors but as secretaries and cooks .Although women were the backbone of the student movement , providing much of the labor , they were rarely public leaders and even more rarely did they stay in their designated place .From the very inception of the Chicano student movement in the late 1960s , there were informal Chicana leaders and specific women 's agendas .The role of women and gender ideology were hotly debated - a fact that has been left out of most movement histories .This erasure normalizes a masculine hegemony within the Chicano movement that was much more contested at the time .It was a dispute regarding the nomination of Anna NietoGomez for the presidency of MEChA that transformed the informal women 's discussion group into an autonomous women 's organization .Many women , however , continued as members of MEChA , engaging in what Latin American feminists have called double militancia , or double activism .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"24.12286"}

Williams , who had fled the U.S. by the time the New Left really kicked off but who was an influence on some people in Black Power circle .He was n't a response to the supposed failures of the old left and if anyone was doing something it makes sense to call identity politics , then I think he was .I think the \" the old left did n't care about race and gender \" line is at least as much a product of how the new left talked about the old left as it 's a result of what the old left actually did .Biffard Misqueegan wrote : .If one views racism as something that is independent of class society and capital ( and therefore something that can be rectified within capitalist society ) , they will approach the issue very differently than somebody who sees identity as historically tied to the social structures of bourgeois society .I 'm not sure I agree with that .I do think different forms of oppression are at least relatively autonomous from capitalism and maybe absolutely autonomous .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"48.9258"}
{"text":"So yeah , wholeheartedly agree with this : .Eve Mitchell wrote : . while intersectionality theorists have rightly identified an objective problem , these divisions and antagonisms within the class must be address materially through struggle .Simply reducing this struggle to mere quantity , equality of distribution , or \" representation , \" reinforces identity as a static , naturalized category .In this sense there 's a dual struggle .The struggle itself , and the simultaneous struggle to define the universal ( i.e. the goals and methods which unite people in struggle ) , which defaults to white , masculine , heterosexual interests ( think rapists on the central committee for a very clear example ) .That is to say the counter to the politics of representation is a politics of self - activity , out of which a universal interest can emerge ( rather than existing timelessly and objectively to be discerned by intellectual vanguards ) .Weirdly though , most of the intersectionalists i 've encountered would fall on the latter side of that split .Perhaps they 're closer to an autonomist Marxism in practice , and just have n't shed the intersectional vocab .Most , if not all , intersectional theorists DO concieve of race and gender as fluid , historically contingent categories , shaped by ( and shaping ) capitalist relations .And , as Joseph Kay points out , activists who draw on intersectional theory are often the main force behind campaigns such as the ones suggested by the author .Indeed , if Mitchell is not familiar with the work and theory of the Incite !Collective , I would highly recommend their books to her .So . while Mitchell 's criticisms do apply to the way identity politics is practised on occasion , I do n't think her article invalidates any of the really good intersectional theory I 've read , including that of Patricia Hill Collins or bell hooks .Fundamentally , all intersectional theorists are arguing is that capitalism , racism and sexism are mutually constitutive , and can not be understood , or resisted , separately .I 've read the piece and I do n't understand what ' identity politics ' is supposed to mean here other than that is has something to do with how people identify themselves .I think it 'd probably help if people talked about particular instances of what they take to be ' identity politics ' rather than talking about ' identity politics ' as such .I mean , ' marxism ' is a huge vague term covering massive disagreements .I would bet that ' identity politics ' is too .I also think it 's a little weird to dismiss identity claims while being like \" reject that stuff and instead check out what we marxists think \" because marxism ( or rather , marxist ) is in a way a kind of identity .Ditto ' feminist ' .I also think the attribution of identity ( and reduction of people to one - sided categories ) to capitalism is probably wrong .Either way I 'd be interested in seeing it empirically supported , rather than via theoretical appeals .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"49.41912"}
