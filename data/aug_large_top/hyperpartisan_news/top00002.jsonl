{"text":"Generally , it seems that victims of eating disorders are perfectionists .They have a desire to please others and have sensitive personalities .Life circumstances can also play a large part .Many sufferers have been victims of bullying or sexual abuse .But of course , not everyone who meets such criteria then falls victim to an eating disorder .An eating disorder is a mental illness .The media can no more trigger an eating disorder than it can cause someone to become clinically depressed or suffer from schizophrenia .The media simply fuels our desire to look at other women 's shapes .While the press appear fixated by the size of celebrities , particularly women 's magazines , I do n't feel they can be blamed for causing eating disorders .However , I do feel they contribute largely towards disordered eating patterns among women , which is a less severe method of controlling weight .Instead of undertaking extreme methods such as starving , using laxatives or bingeing and vomiting , they develop an unhealthy relationship with food and are constantly worrying about what they have eaten , what they will or wo n't eat and when .With endless articles displaying new diets , we 're constantly told how we must lose our fat .Food is made out to be the enemy and we 're made to feel guilty for eating it .Yet they 'll publish pictures of thin celebrities alongside these diets , all the while supposedly berating them for their thinness .I really despair of what 's happening in society with regards to food and weight .At one extreme are the frightening obesity statistics and at the other , the rise in eating disorders .I feel there is just too much emphasis on food and body shape altogether and wish it would stop .I developed an eating disorder over 27 years ago , and I 'm sorry to say , am still suffering and probably always will .However , I would say I am in control of my disorder rather than it controlling me .I can freely admit that the media contributed nothing whatsoever towards my development of the condition , although I did at one time cut out many pictures and photos of people whom I considered had an ideal body shape .They were usually ballet dancers or marathon runners and the odd model or actress .I 'd trot along with them to whichever therapist I was seeing at the time and say \" look , this person is functioning perfectly well at this weight , so why ca n't I ? \" This was because I was always trying to convince psychologists etc that it was OK to be underweight .They 'd just reply that they were not normal people .That was their profession .I was originally suffering from Bulimia Nervosa , quite extremely .I did n't know anyone who had this illness , indeed I did n't even know it was an illness .One day I started a diet after a random comment from a boyfriend .I bought a box of muesli and ate most of the box because I was so hungry .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"49.07"}

'President Lincoln also had to worry about Grant 's military judgment on the way to Richmond in the spring of 1864 and the subsequent deadlock around Petersburg and Richmond .In the fall of 1864 , President Lincoln summoned General Grenville Dodge to the White House and interrogated him over lunch .Mr. Lincoln \" finally led up to the placed where he asked me the question of what I thought about Grant , and what I thought about his next campaign .Just as he asked the question , we got up from the table .He took my hand in both of his and very solemnly said , ' You do n't know how glad I am to hear you say that .

{"text":"No .A Republican Congress and Mike Huckabee for president ?Yes .As long as Obama is president , it is unlikely Sgt .Bowe Bergdahl will be convicted of anything or even court - martialed ( \" Hostage swap might signal Gitmo closing .\" July ) .Daniel B. Jeffs Apple Valley , Calif. .As long as Obama is President , it is unlikely that Sergeant Bergdahl will be convicted of anything or even court - martialed , when in all likelihood , he should be prosecuted for desertion , collaborating with the enemy and treason .The reason is simple .It would make President Obama look even more foolish because of the dangerous trade for five high level Taliban terrorists -- national security be damned .Negotiating with Iran to stop their nuclear weapon development is an exercise in futility .Iran will continue to pursue nuclear weapons until stopped by complete sanctions and military action if necessary .President Obama 's drive to have a nuclear weapon - free world is delusional .Agreeing to reduce our nuclear weapons from about 5000 to 1500 was a deadly mistake , and he wants to reduce them further .We must retain the deterrent with overwhelming nuclear strength .America is now much more vulnerable and the world is less safe .It 's bad enough that decades of weak border enforcement and weak illegal alien enforcement have imposed too great a burden on American citizens ' tax dollars supporting millions of illegal aliens ' housing , health care , education and welfare .Indeed , Illegal alien criminals , drug cartel operatives and gangs who prey on our citizens must be stopped along with the out - of - control flow of illegals .Considering President Obama 's refusal to enforce immigration laws and border security , the only solution to stopping unabated border crossings is to militarize the border .That should be done immediately and it should remain that way permanently to keep out criminals , drug cartels , terrorists and the flow of illegal aliens .The security of the American people demands it .President Barack Obama has begun his transformation of America and abdicated his responsibility to enforce laws that do not fit his agenda .Indeed , his intentional failures have turned into a crisis of illegal aliens flowing across the border , including many children from South America -- 100,000 and counting -- most of whom will not be deported .Worse , President Obama has seriously violated our country 's sovereignty , our economy and our domestic and national security by allowing potential terrorists to cross the border .Obama 's failed foreign policy is stimulating the proliferation of terrorists in the Middle East who are dedicated to the destruction of America with no remorse .Coupled with the steady growth of already big government , overreaching regulations , punishing taxation , and the loss of freedoms , the administration and liberal Democrats ' abuse of power are a clear and present danger to our country and American citizens .This can only be overcome by changing the executive , legislative and judicial branches of our government to constitutional limited government -- with our votes .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"50.25743"}

{"text":"Kaepernick has actually been fairly good at limiting turnovers throughout his career , as he has now thrown 50 touchdown passes with 21 interceptions .Despite his high - level mobility , Kaepernick fell victim to 42 sacks on the year .The biggest problem with Kaepernick is , while his rushing numbers make him relatively safe , his lack of pass attempts limit his upside .Kaepernick attempted fewer than 30 passes per game .That puts him down with the likes of Blake Bortles , Andy Dalton and Alex Smith .With Michael Crabtree now gone , Kaepernick will have to get comfortable with a new WR2 in Torrey Smith , who joins the team from Baltimore .That could be a blessing in disguise , though , as Crabtree finished with fewer than 700 yards and only four touchdowns this past year .The Daily News has learned that embattled 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick wants out of San Francisco after a forgettable 2015 that included on - field struggles that resulted in a benching midway through the season and a coaching change after it .The Jets are his preferred destination , according to sources .( New York Daily News ) .FFToday 's Take : Even though San Francisco just signed Kaepernick to a new deal last season , the structure of the contract does n't guarantee Kaepernick 's 2016 salary ( 11.9 million ) until April 1st , meaning he could be traded or released .The Jets have stated they are interested in re - signing Ryan Fitzpatrick so this move seems unlikely at this time .Stay tuned ... .The San Francisco 49ers have hired Chip Kelly to be their next head coach , the team announced Thursday .Kelly joins the 49ers after three seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles , whom he led to the playoffs once before being fired with one game remaining in the 2015 season .He was 26 - 21 overall with Philadelphia .Kelly rose to fame for his offensive style during four seasons and a 46 - 7 record as coach at Oregon .( ESPN ) .FFToday 's Take : Many thought Kelly 's time in the NFL had come to close but the former Eagles coach will move to west coast and take over a franchise in a messy situation .The 49ers are coming off a disastrous season that included countless retirements and season - long injuries .Kelly 's hiring may signal life for QB Colin Kaepernick who could become a viable fantasy option in Kelly 's up - tempo offense .The San Francisco 49ers ' head - coaching search has arguably already gone on longer than expected .Now , a new name has either entered or re - entered the picture , depending on which report you 're reading : former Raiders , Broncos and Washington coach Mike Shanahan .Shanahan has been out of the NFL for the last two years , having been fired by Washington prior to the 2014 season .( CBS Sports ) .FFToday 's Take : The 49ers coaching search has covered a lot of ground to this point and it appears Mike Shanahan may get a chance to torment fantasy owners once again .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"42.856575"}

{"text":"Moving that much earth does n't just require a lot of energy .It can also lead to toxic mine drainage , probably the biggest environmental concern associated with gold - mining .When you dig up rock that 's been buried for a long time , air and moisture can set off chemical reactions that produce acids and leach toxic metals .If those substances - sulfuric acid , arsenic and copper , for example - run off into lakes , rivers and streams , they will pose serious risks for populations of fish and other aquatic organisms .Mine drainage is a problem for many kinds of operations , but it 's especially significant for gold extraction .For one thing , gold is often found in rock that contains a lot of acid - generating sulfides ; for another , mining gold produces much more unwanted rock than does mining other minerals .Once you start extracting the gold from the ore , new issues arise .Take mercury , for example .The element , which has been linked to a host of negative health effects , is found in many metal and coal deposits .Large - scale gold operations often start processing ore by roasting it , which can shoot a lot of mercury into the atmosphere .( The same thing happens at coal - burning power plants , the source of about half the United States ' airborne mercury emissions in 2005 . )New pollution control technologies can greatly reduce the emissions from gold roasters .For example , according to University of Nevada environmental science professor Glenn Miller , scrubbers have helped Nevada cut its mercury emissions from more than 20,000 pounds a year a decade ago to just about 4,000 pounds a year .Meanwhile , there 's hope that new treatment processes can also alleviate the serious mercury pollution issues related to small - scale gold - mining in the developing world .According to the EPA , these operations - which produce about one - fifth of the world 's gold - are currently the planet 's No . 1 source of mercury releases to the environment .Whether or not they roast the ore , big mining operations typically finish off the extraction process by dousing the ore in cyanide .Cyanide is extremely lethal , but as an environmental contaminant it 's not as problematic as mercury , since it degrades fairly quickly .( Mercury sticks around forever . )Some of the byproducts of that degradation process , such as nitrates , may contaminate groundwater , but a bigger issue is that the use of cyanide allows mining companies to go after very low - grade ore .That means they end up digging up more earth to produce the same amount of gold , which produces huge amounts of tailings , the material that 's left over once the ore has been processed .Gold tailing ponds and piles are chock - full of contaminants such as arsenic , antimony , residual cyanide and mercury , and so must be carefully managed to avoid generating runoff or coming into contact with wildlife .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"28.859386"}

Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he was suspending New York 's participation in a federal immigration enforcement plan that has drawn fire from immigrant advocates , civil liberties lawyers and elected officials in the state and around the country .A statement from Mr. Cuomo 's office said there was \" mounting evidence \" that the program , called Secure Communities , had not only failed to meet its goal of deporting the most serious immigrant criminals but was also undermining law enforcement and compromising public safety .\" There are concerns about the implementation of the program as well as its impact on families , immigrant communities and law enforcement in New York , \" Mr. Cuomo said .Unless those concerns are eased , the statement said , New York will not take part .Mr. Cuomo 's decision makes New York the second state to announce its intention to withdraw from the program , and sets up a confrontation with the Obama administration , which has made Secure Communities a cornerstone of immigration enforcement strategy .Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois said in May that he was canceling his state 's participation .Under the program , begun by the Bush administration in 2008 , the fingerprints of everyone booked into a local or county jail are sent to the Department of Homeland Security and compared with prints in its files .If officials find that a suspect is in the country illegally , or is a noncitizen with a criminal record , they may seek to deport the person .By Wednesday , that fingerprint sharing had been introduced in about 41 percent of the nation 's jurisdictions , including 27 of 62 counties in New York .Mr. Cuomo 's move means that those counties ' participation will end .The entire country is scheduled to join the program by 2013 .The practical effects of Mr. Cuomo 's decision are unclear .New York law enforcement agencies regularly check fingerprints with the Federal Bureau of Investigation .Homeland Security officials said that regardless of New York 's participation in Secure Communities , the F.B.I. would still share fingerprints with the immigration agency .Federal officials said that if states did not share fingerprints with the F.B.I. , those states would lose access to federal criminal databases , undermining their ability to fight crime .While Secure Communities has contributed to a sharp rise in deportations under President Obama , it does not appear to have won him many allies .It has angered immigrants who supported Democrats in recent elections .It has also failed to convince many of the president 's Republican opponents that he is sufficiently committed to enforcement .Opponents of the program contend that even though it was mainly intended to ensnare convicted criminals and people deemed a security threat , it has instead caught too many immigrants charged with low - level crimes or guilty only of being in the country illegally .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"47.21431"}

{"text":"Experts say white supremacist groups are on the rise , fueled by a bad economy and the election of a black president .By Ron Scherer , Staff Writer , Kevin Loria , Contributor / August 6 , 2012 .The deadly shooting at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee is renewing concern about the white supremacist movement in the United States , which experts say is on the rise in large part because of the weak economy and a visceral distrust among some people of the first African - American president .Wade Michael Page , who gunned down six people Sunday before being shot and killed by police , was a member of a hardcore rock band that was part of underground movement featuring racist ideologies and he had coded racist tattoos .Police have not released any details as to Mr. Page 's motivations .Despite the increase in the number of hate groups , however , it is relatively rare for their vitriol to result in actual violence , experts say .Instead , their invective shows up on website chat rooms and in social media like Facebook and Twitter , using relatively obscure names oftentimes related to Adolf Hitler .White supremacist members , often with shaved heads and tattoos extolling the Nazi cause , meet periodically at barbeques and concerts that receive little advance publicity .Their music is often filled with lyrics that appeal to alienated individuals .High unemployment caused by the lingering economic recession often fuels resentment , causing groups to lash out at immigrants or others often competing for low - wage jobs .The Sept. 11 , 2011 terrorist attacks caused a backlash against Muslims , and attacks have been reported on Sikhs by people confusing them with Muslims .At the same time that hate groups appear to be on the rise , hate crimes have fallen to a 14-year low , Mr. Levin says .Hate crime homicides are relatively rare .\" The last ten years we 've averaged under a dozen a year , \" Levin says .\" But most years it 's in single digits .\" When they do take place , the odds are good a white supremacist was involved .According to Mark Pitcavage , director of investigative research at the Anti - Defamation League , 85 percent of all extremist - related murders are committed by white supremacists .The most violent group , according to Pitcavage , is the Texas Aryan Brotherhood , which the ADL says has committed at least 29 murders .Even when group members are arrested , they continue operating in prison , Pitcavage says .According to the Houston Chronicle , a four - year statewide investigation by law enforcement into the group resulted in the prosecution of 34 members for murder and racketeering .Another 30 ended up in state prisons .According to Pitcavage , gaining membership in a hate group such as Hammerskins requires a trial period for other members to assess a prospective member .In the case of Page , he appears to have joined the group early in 2011 and became a full - fledged member by late 2011 , Pitcavage says .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"64.061806"}

McConnell , who - as you well know - is in a very tough race , \" said Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , who voted to advance the measure after initially saying he would oppose it .Eager to avoid another crisis after the GOP - led House barely passed the clean debt ceiling increase Tuesday evening , Senate Republican leaders wanted a drama - free Wednesday .The 45-member Senate Republican Conference met over lunch behind closed doors in the Senate 's ornate Mansfield Room , debating how to proceed for more than 90 minutes but reaching no consensus .Starting the vote more than 10 minutes late , the outcome was still unclear after the conference engaged in its first real debate about how to proceed in the aftermath of the House 's decision to pass a \" clean \" debt ceiling bill Wednesday evening .That internal debate spilled into open view on the Senate floor .A grim - faced McConnell stood next to the white - haired Cornyn , who quietly discussed a way forward with Murkowski , Collins , Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) and a handful of other senators .Tension filled the room as the vote was kept open for more than an hour .The clerks were informed not to announce the names of the senators who had voted , allowing the leaders to urge senators to switch their votes .Senate Hid Key Vote on Increasing Debt Limit from Public View .In this Feb. 12 , 2014 , photo , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev . , from left , Sen.

Truman ( 1884 - 1972 ) issued Executive Order 9835 , also known as the Loyalty Order , which mandated that all federal employees be analyzed to determine whether they were sufficiently loyal to the government .Truman 's loyalty program was a startling development for a country that prized the concepts of personal liberty and freedom of political organization .Yet it was only one of many questionable activities that occurred during the period of anticommunist hysteria known as the Red Scare .Probing Red Influence .One of the pioneering efforts to investigate communist activities took place in the U.S. House of Representatives , where the House Un - American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) was formed in 1938 .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"50.628708"}

{"text":"If two - thirds of the sitting senators find the president guilty , he is removed from office .If Bill Clinton is removed , Vice - President Al Gore will automatically take over the presidency until elections in 2000 .How did it all start ?Strangely enough , not with Monica Lewinsky .Prosecutor Kenneth Starr was originally granted license to investigate the allegations that Clinton had broken the law in connection with the improper dealings of the Whitewater property company before he even became President .Monica Lewinsky gave evidence , denying any sexual relationship with the President , during the Paula Jones 's sexual - harassment lawsuit against him .Starr had picked up the possibility of Clinton committing or encouraging perjury over the Lewinsky affair in late 1997 .After Starr 's grand jury took evidence from both Lewinsky and Clinton , the Prosecutor published his report in September 1998 .A month later , the House Judiciary Committee voted to launch a congressional impeachment inquiry against Clinton .What is the House Judiciary Committee ?The House Judiciary Committee is one of over two hundred Congress committees currently in use .Because of the number of issues Congress has to deal with , committees are empowered to consider legislation , conduct hearings and investigations , and carry out other assignments as instructed by the chamber .The Judiciary Committee is one of Congress 's more important , permanent standing committees and it considers many other judicial issues apart from impeachment cases .But it will seldom attract as much attention as in the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton .The majority party holds a majority of the seats on every committee .Hence , the Judiciary Committee currently consists of 21 Republican congressmen and women and 15 Democrats .Its pro - Republican , anti - Clinton character is undisputed : chairman Henry Hyde sponsored an amendment banning the federal funding of abortions in the 1970s ; another Republican member , Bob Barr , attempted to impeach Clinton before the Lewinsky scandal broke .In impeachment cases , the judiciary committee 's role is to develop \" articles of impeachment \" ( charges ) against the President .The Senate then uses these in the final trial to decide whether the President is thrown from office .These charges stem from allegations surrounding the President that he denied the Lewinsky affair and tried to obstruct justice during the Paula Jones ' harassment case brought against him .An important precedent was set here by Walter Nixon , a Mississippi judge .He was the last US official to be impeached in 1989 , for lying to a grand jury trial over marijuana - smuggling .Republican Congressman Sensenbrenner believes this case could prove a decisive precedent .How might Clinton be cleared ?A person commits perjury in US law when they wilfully subscribes to any matter he does not believe to be true .Subornation of perjury is when a person induces another to commit perjury .It is very rare for perjury to be applied in civil cases , like the Paula Jones harassment case , because lawyers accept that lying is endemic .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"36.922363"}

{"text":"Why did they ?The reasons and the causes of this war are not dried cut .There would be more than one reason , more than one cause , with slavery being one of them , and the preservation of the Union being another .But is was more than that , much more than that .This was a war of passion , a war of principles , a war that would tear away at the heart and soul of this county , and of the individual .Let us look at these reasons again , what could cause this type of division ? ?However , it even goes deeper than that .Let us first concentrate on the issue of slavery , and reflect on some comments made by Gabor S. Boritt ( a historian ) .He stated that \" In colonial times most Americans regarded slavery as a necessary evil .The Founding Fathers of the United States had been unable to abolish slavery and compromised over it in the writing of the Constitution . \"After seeing this comment , I looked at the Constitution , and this is what I found , that indeed there was conflict .Even then , over the queston of slavery and the northern states wanted the power to forbid the foreign slave trade , while the southern delegates did not .A compromise was reached that stated that Congress would not be allowed to regulate the foreign slave trade till 1808 .By the early 1800 's , many Northerners had come to view slavery as wrong .Abolitionists in the North began a movement to end it .Some of this same sentiment existed in the South , however it is said that \" Southerners found slavery to be highly profitable and in time came to consider it a postive good . \"Within this same article it states , \" that even though many of the white Southerners who did not own slaves supported slavery , for they accepted two main ideas that without slavery the South 's economy would collapse and that blacks were inferior to whites .\" In 1858 , Senator William Seward of New York referred to the differences between the North and the South as \" an irrepressible conflict . \"He placed slavery at the heart of that uncontrollable conflict .In fact , it is said that \" debates over slavery raged in Congress between the Northern and Southern lawmakers during most of the 1850 's . \" But like I stated before it goes much deeper than that .It began in colonial times which resulted from the differences in the cultures of people that settled in each as well as from geographical differences .In the South , the climate was found ideal for growing tobacco and other plantation crops .After the plantations were started black slaves were brought here from Africa to provide most of the labor .While up North , the cooler and rocky soil in the north was not suitable for plantations or large farms .As a result of this North became dependent on trade , more than agriculture .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"30.237598"}

{"text":"Histories of the Chicano and feminist movements have failed to fully record the vital forms of Chicana political consciousness and organizing that existed in this period .While there are many other sources of Chicana feminist consciousness and organizing projects that need to be more fully documented , the story of Anna NietoGomez and members of Las Hijas de Cuauhtémoc is a significant thread in the multilayered struggle around gender and sexuality in el movimiento .Although they were a small organization , their impact as one of the first organizations to explicitly call for and theorize Chicana feminism was paramount .Their ideas informed the terrain of struggle across movement sectors , reached into gendered discussions in other regions , and gave other women and men who believed in gender equity within the broader project of Chicano liberation a vehicle for speaking out .While their work was vital within the student movement , they were also part of a broader mobilization of movement women in the greater Los Angeles region that included the East Los Angeles Chicana Welfare Rights Organization and the Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional .While this history bursts with telling , it has been also been a challenging one to tell because it makes us reconsider the limited ( and limiting ) conventions of writing history .He argues that we engage \" simultaneously in the sociohistorical process and in narrative constructions about that process . \"8 Further , he argues : .What matters most are the process and conditions of production of such narratives .Only a focus on that process can uncover the ways in which the two sides of historicity intertwine in a particular context .Only through the overlap can we discover the differential exercise of power that makes some narratives possible and silences others.9 .It is not enough to say , \" The women were there , too . \"To subvert the ideologies of these official histories , we must overturn the epistemological register that licenses them .Because the add and stir method is not sufficient , this project proposes an alternative historiographic framework for understanding women 's social movements .Illustrating that history is more than just a narrative of the past , it examines how memory circulates in popular culture and produces and maintains political identities and the boundaries of what is politically possible today .It locates the contributions of the Hijas de Cuauhtémoc within the development of Chicana feminism in relation to other organizations and contextualizes their interventions in regional , cross - regional , and national developments .And it reveals the unprecedented shifts in gendered consciousness and political subjectivity that resulted from women 's participation in the Chicano movement .The architecture of this book builds on the historical importance of the women I interviewed and the knowledge collectively produced in their oral histories .I begin to introduce them to you here in this prelude so that through their stories you can hear the distortions in the historical record .As in music , this prelude functions as more than just an introduction to the historical record .It sets the soundscape and signals the major riffs and musical samples of those narratives of the Chicano movement .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"21.442286"}

'Opposition to lynching was one of the core elements of the Popular Front in the 1930s in the U.S.There was also extensive conversation on ' the woman question ' .I 'm not defending the CP and I 'm not saying the old left was right on that stuff or that it was adequate , but I do n't think it 's true that there was refusal to address those issues .There 's also both a women 's movement and an African American civil rights movement in the U.S. prior to the 1960s , with some overlaps with the marxist influenced left .A good example of this is Robert F. Williams , who had fled the U.S. by the time the New Left really kicked off but who was an influence on some people in Black Power circle .He was n't a response to the supposed failures of the old left and if anyone was doing something it makes sense to call identity politics , then I think he was .I think the \" the old left did n't care about race and gender \" line is at least as much a product of how the new left talked about the old left as it 's a result of what the old left actually did .Biffard Misqueegan wrote : .If one views racism as something that is independent of class society and capital ( and therefore something that can be rectified within capitalist society ) , they will approach the issue very differently than somebody who sees identity as historically tied to the social structures of bourgeois society .I 'm not sure I agree with that .I do think different forms of oppression are at least relatively autonomous from capitalism and maybe absolutely autonomous .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"48.9258"}
{"text":"So yeah , wholeheartedly agree with this : .Eve Mitchell wrote : . while intersectionality theorists have rightly identified an objective problem , these divisions and antagonisms within the class must be address materially through struggle .Simply reducing this struggle to mere quantity , equality of distribution , or \" representation , \" reinforces identity as a static , naturalized category .In this sense there 's a dual struggle .The struggle itself , and the simultaneous struggle to define the universal ( i.e. the goals and methods which unite people in struggle ) , which defaults to white , masculine , heterosexual interests ( think rapists on the central committee for a very clear example ) .That is to say the counter to the politics of representation is a politics of self - activity , out of which a universal interest can emerge ( rather than existing timelessly and objectively to be discerned by intellectual vanguards ) .Weirdly though , most of the intersectionalists i 've encountered would fall on the latter side of that split .Perhaps they 're closer to an autonomist Marxism in practice , and just have n't shed the intersectional vocab .Most , if not all , intersectional theorists DO concieve of race and gender as fluid , historically contingent categories , shaped by ( and shaping ) capitalist relations .And , as Joseph Kay points out , activists who draw on intersectional theory are often the main force behind campaigns such as the ones suggested by the author .Indeed , if Mitchell is not familiar with the work and theory of the Incite !Collective , I would highly recommend their books to her .So . while Mitchell 's criticisms do apply to the way identity politics is practised on occasion , I do n't think her article invalidates any of the really good intersectional theory I 've read , including that of Patricia Hill Collins or bell hooks .Fundamentally , all intersectional theorists are arguing is that capitalism , racism and sexism are mutually constitutive , and can not be understood , or resisted , separately .I 've read the piece and I do n't understand what ' identity politics ' is supposed to mean here other than that is has something to do with how people identify themselves .I think it 'd probably help if people talked about particular instances of what they take to be ' identity politics ' rather than talking about ' identity politics ' as such .I mean , ' marxism ' is a huge vague term covering massive disagreements .I would bet that ' identity politics ' is too .I also think it 's a little weird to dismiss identity claims while being like \" reject that stuff and instead check out what we marxists think \" because marxism ( or rather , marxist ) is in a way a kind of identity .Ditto ' feminist ' .I also think the attribution of identity ( and reduction of people to one - sided categories ) to capitalism is probably wrong .Either way I 'd be interested in seeing it empirically supported , rather than via theoretical appeals .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"49.41912"}
