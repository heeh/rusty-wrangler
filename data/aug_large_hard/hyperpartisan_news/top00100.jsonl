{"text":"Yesterday Trump was on Laura Ingraham 's radio show and had something to say about the Syrian refugee crisis that most of the civilized world is struggling to address .But his remarks were not about the human suffering or the logistical challenges or potential solutions .What Trump sought to add to the debate was a ludicrous and wholly unfounded conspiracy theory accusing President Obama of another dastardly deed .Trump :They send [ the refugees ] to the Republicans , not to the Democrats , you know , because they know the problems .In California you have a Democrat as a governor .In Florida you have Rick Scott .So , you know , they send them to the Republicans because , you know , why would we want to bother the Democrats ?It 's just insane .Taking these people is absolutely insanity .I do n't know if you know .They 're talking about hundreds of thousands potentially .Hundreds of thousands .Where to begin .How about with the fact that Trump 's assertion is a bald - faced lie .His projection of the distribution of refugees based on the party affiliation of a state 's governor makes no sense whatsoever , and he does n't bother to provide any support for the wild claim .Even using the example that he provided , the facts show that California has already taken in 218 Syrian refugees this year ( more than any other state ) , while Florida has taken only 104 ( placing them down at seventh ) .What 's more , states with Republican governors can be expected to receive more refugees simply because there are more of them .Currently there are 31 states led by Republicans and 18 by Democrats .Furthermore , Trump 's assertion that there are plans to resettle \" hundreds of thousands \" of refugees must have been pulled straight out of his ass , because there is no such estimate in reality .The federal government has committed to receiving about 10,000 refugees .So Trump is only off by at least ninety percent .Now if you 're wondering how Trump can get away with making such blatantly false comments and still retain his position at the top of the GOP primary contest , the answer is in the the type of voter to whom Trump is appealing .A new survey ( pdf ) by the Public Religion Research Institute ( PRRI ) reveals that Trump 's supporters are fervently opposed to immigrants with 69 % saying that \" immigration is a critical issue to them personally .\" That compares to only 50 % of supporters of other Republican candidates .In addition , the survey found that ... .Trump supporters are much more likely to express negative views of immigrants than the supporters of other candidates .Eight in ten ( 80 % )Trump supporters say that immigrants today are a burden to the U.S. because they take American jobs , housing , and health care .Nearly three - quarters ( 73 % ) of Trump supporters say that it bothers them when they come into contact with immigrants who speak little or no English .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"75.86246"}

{"text":"Hi Anderson , Appreciate the stories about the Mexico border .It just seems like an \" impossible \" task to secure the border .I just recently saw a story on America 's Most Wanted concerning the extensive corruption of the Mexican police department , which probably compounds the problems .Because of their low wages , they are on the \" take \" and willing to look the other way when it comes to enforcement of the law .I do believe a lot of things are ignored .Keep up the good , informative work .Look forward to your show each night .In my opinion the US has no control over the borders .I live in a town where the industry brings the mexicans here by the bus load .I am sure many are illegal .We are also turning into the meth capitol of the world not just the \" carpet capital \" .It seems the police blotter is bursting with hispanic names for drug arrest everyday .It is really sad .I am all for people wanting the American way of life but it is so scary especially with knowing my young children will grow up here .It 's difficult for U.S. authorities to investigate sex trafficking of children when Mexican police seem to turn a blind eye to what is happening right in front of their eyes .I think that there needs to be a top - down approach to the border and surrounding areas of Mexico .You ca n't single out the Mexican police and claim they are acting irresponsible .It is like that in the rest of Central and Latin America .There needs to be pressure from the administrations of each country , especially Mexico and the United States .If President Bush claims that we need to police the world , then we should start with our own neighbors .If you ca n't keep your neighbors happy and out of your backyard , then there is no way the foreign policy will work on other countries .We need to impose restrictions on the Mexican government in order for their administration to have an effect on the police and other authorities operating on or around the border .Of course , where there is demand for any product , there will exist supply .The drug running satisfies our desire for illicit drugs , so the root problem is here .Likewise , I have no doubt that the majority of child prostitutes satisfy the numerous ' sex tourists ' from the U.S.Pointing the blame does not solve the problem , but neither do drug laws and like legislation .I can honestly advise your readers and listeners that we have far more pressing concerns in this country than increased border presence ( i.e. current war , health care , wage concerns , plant closings , impending job losses , etc .. )Unfortunately , this is not primarily a US problem to fix .It would be easy enough for us to build a wall / fence and actually police it ( though we do n't do that ! ) but as long as sex trafficking of children and general drug trade can be done openly with no fear of punishment then there is nothing we can do .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.39999"}

{"text":"The only two routes for Manning now are appeals and a pardon .The appeal option probably is n't terribly realistic , for a couple of reasons .First , as mentioned above , Manning admitted to a significant portion of the case , and his guilt in releasing the material has never been in doubt .Being found guilty on this basis is hardly a miscarriage of justice , at least in the trial - process sense .Given the scope of the crime , the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is n't likely to proclaim Manning a whistleblower , despite what his lawyer and Wikileaks ' fans think .This is n't a Pentagon Papers situation - Manning did n't discriminate in his leaks , but instead exposed seemingly everything within his grasp .Unfortunately for Manning , the pardon option is even less likely .First , there has n't been a President as parsimonious with pardons than Barack Obama .For instance , while Eric Holder has proclaimed prior prosecutions and sentencing in the war on drugs as unjust - an arguable position - Obama has n't done a thing to correct those implied specific injustices , at least not until now .With Obama in full pursuit of Edward Snowden , who has a better case to make as a whistleblower , he 's even more unlikely to cough up a pardon for someone who appears to have exposed American secrets out of spite .Manning will be waiting in Leavenworth for a long time for that pardon .According to a new statement from Manning , he 'd prefer to wait it out as Chelsea Manning and get sex - change therapy : .As I transition into this next phase of my life , I want everyone to know the real me .I am Chelsea Manning .I am a female .Given the way that I feel , and have felt since childhood , I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible .I hope that you will support me in this transition .I also request that , starting today , you refer to me by my new name and use the feminine pronoun ( except in official mail to the confinement facility ) .I look forward to receiving letters from supporters and having the opportunity to write back .Coombs said he is \" hoping \" that Fort Leavenworth \" would do the right thing \" and provide hormone therapy for Manning .\" If Fort Leavenworth does not , then I 'm going to do everything in my power to make sure they are forced to do so .\" The facility does not provide hormone therapy or sex - reassignment surgery for gender identity issues but does provide psychiatric care , a Fort Leavenworth spokeswoman told Courthouse News earlier this week .In the U.S. prison system , transgender prisoners who have not had genital surgery are generally assigned to live with their birth - sex peers , but the military policy is unclear .It 's going to a long and unhappy wait for Manning on all of these fronts .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"64.26408"}

{"text":"After Orly sent her bogus self generated subpoena ( with no authority from the courts ) to the Hawaii Director of Health , Loretta Fuddy , she received and posted on her website this response , and a copy of the letter : . \" Attorney General of HI states , that the director of Health Loretta Fuddy will not comply with the subpoena and will not provide access to original BC due to reasons of privacy .It 's not privacy , it 's forgery , stupid .Of course Orly is far to incompetent to grasp the fact that the state of Hawaii can only issue copies of a birth certificate to those legally eligible to obtain them .If Obama decides to release it further then that 's his business , and his right to do so .The fact that he did chose to release it to the public does NOT change the state laws .Did you think the birther issue had been put to rest ?Why , of course not !Author Jerome Corsi intends to pick up where Donald Trump left off with his new book , \" Where 's the Birth Certificate ?The Case that Barack Obama is not Eligible to be President .\" Released this week , Corsi claims that he found flaws in Obama 's long form certificate .Well , this time , Obama and his reelection team are giving Corsi , and anyone else who continues to doubt the legitimacy of his birth certificate , the invisible finger by using the birther nonsense to their advantage - their monetary advantage to be more exact .The Chicago Sun - Times is reporting that the Obama 2012 team is selling mugs and t - shirts with the president 's long form birth certificate .In an e - mail to the Times Wednesday morning , Obama 2012 deputy campaign manager Julianna Smoot said , \" There 's really no way to make this stuff completely go away .The only thing we can do is laugh at it - and make sure as many other people as possible are in on the joke .For folks who contribute at least $ 15 to the campaign , they will receive a \" limited edition \" Obama birth certificate mug .One side of the mug has the long form certificate , while the other side has a picture of Obama with the words , \" Made in the USA .\" For those who donate $ 30 , they can look forward to a t - shirt .I did n't see all of The Last Word last night due to the storms that passed through Atlanta .So I missed this very hilarious segment of the very nutty Orly Taitz trying to talk over Lawrence O'Donnell ... .She also had to compete with herself from earlier today , when she said that a real long form birth certificate would have said \" negro \" under \" father 's nationality , \" not \" African .Taitz began by awkwardly asking for a close - up , so that she could show a document that she claimed was Obama 's selective service record .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"81.592766"}
