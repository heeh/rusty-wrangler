{"text":"Yesterday Trump was on Laura Ingraham 's radio show and had something to say about the Syrian refugee crisis that most of the civilized world is struggling to address .But his remarks were not about the human suffering or the logistical challenges or potential solutions .What Trump sought to add to the debate was a ludicrous and wholly unfounded conspiracy theory accusing President Obama of another dastardly deed .Trump :They send [ the refugees ] to the Republicans , not to the Democrats , you know , because they know the problems .In California you have a Democrat as a governor .In Florida you have Rick Scott .So , you know , they send them to the Republicans because , you know , why would we want to bother the Democrats ?It 's just insane .Taking these people is absolutely insanity .I do n't know if you know .They 're talking about hundreds of thousands potentially .Hundreds of thousands .Where to begin .How about with the fact that Trump 's assertion is a bald - faced lie .His projection of the distribution of refugees based on the party affiliation of a state 's governor makes no sense whatsoever , and he does n't bother to provide any support for the wild claim .Even using the example that he provided , the facts show that California has already taken in 218 Syrian refugees this year ( more than any other state ) , while Florida has taken only 104 ( placing them down at seventh ) .What 's more , states with Republican governors can be expected to receive more refugees simply because there are more of them .Currently there are 31 states led by Republicans and 18 by Democrats .Furthermore , Trump 's assertion that there are plans to resettle \" hundreds of thousands \" of refugees must have been pulled straight out of his ass , because there is no such estimate in reality .The federal government has committed to receiving about 10,000 refugees .So Trump is only off by at least ninety percent .Now if you 're wondering how Trump can get away with making such blatantly false comments and still retain his position at the top of the GOP primary contest , the answer is in the the type of voter to whom Trump is appealing .A new survey ( pdf ) by the Public Religion Research Institute ( PRRI ) reveals that Trump 's supporters are fervently opposed to immigrants with 69 % saying that \" immigration is a critical issue to them personally .\" That compares to only 50 % of supporters of other Republican candidates .In addition , the survey found that ... .Trump supporters are much more likely to express negative views of immigrants than the supporters of other candidates .Eight in ten ( 80 % )Trump supporters say that immigrants today are a burden to the U.S. because they take American jobs , housing , and health care .Nearly three - quarters ( 73 % ) of Trump supporters say that it bothers them when they come into contact with immigrants who speak little or no English .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"75.86246"}

{"text":"Hi Anderson , Appreciate the stories about the Mexico border .It just seems like an \" impossible \" task to secure the border .I just recently saw a story on America 's Most Wanted concerning the extensive corruption of the Mexican police department , which probably compounds the problems .Because of their low wages , they are on the \" take \" and willing to look the other way when it comes to enforcement of the law .I do believe a lot of things are ignored .Keep up the good , informative work .Look forward to your show each night .In my opinion the US has no control over the borders .I live in a town where the industry brings the mexicans here by the bus load .I am sure many are illegal .We are also turning into the meth capitol of the world not just the \" carpet capital \" .It seems the police blotter is bursting with hispanic names for drug arrest everyday .It is really sad .I am all for people wanting the American way of life but it is so scary especially with knowing my young children will grow up here .It 's difficult for U.S. authorities to investigate sex trafficking of children when Mexican police seem to turn a blind eye to what is happening right in front of their eyes .I think that there needs to be a top - down approach to the border and surrounding areas of Mexico .You ca n't single out the Mexican police and claim they are acting irresponsible .It is like that in the rest of Central and Latin America .There needs to be pressure from the administrations of each country , especially Mexico and the United States .If President Bush claims that we need to police the world , then we should start with our own neighbors .If you ca n't keep your neighbors happy and out of your backyard , then there is no way the foreign policy will work on other countries .We need to impose restrictions on the Mexican government in order for their administration to have an effect on the police and other authorities operating on or around the border .Of course , where there is demand for any product , there will exist supply .The drug running satisfies our desire for illicit drugs , so the root problem is here .Likewise , I have no doubt that the majority of child prostitutes satisfy the numerous ' sex tourists ' from the U.S.Pointing the blame does not solve the problem , but neither do drug laws and like legislation .I can honestly advise your readers and listeners that we have far more pressing concerns in this country than increased border presence ( i.e. current war , health care , wage concerns , plant closings , impending job losses , etc .. )Unfortunately , this is not primarily a US problem to fix .It would be easy enough for us to build a wall / fence and actually police it ( though we do n't do that ! ) but as long as sex trafficking of children and general drug trade can be done openly with no fear of punishment then there is nothing we can do .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.39999"}

George Pataki , he switched parties to run for New York City Council as a Republican against the Democratic incumbent Eva Moskowitz .The foray was short - lived and did not produce a permanent party change ; he shifted his party affiliation back to Democrat in June 2004 .Afterward he focused on his work for Trump .As of early June 2008 , Cohen was named chief operating officer of Affliction Entertainment , a new partnership formed between Affliction , a Gothic - inspired fashion line for men , with Trump .The goal was to produce and promote live events featuring mixed - martial arts . \" MMA is the fastest growing sport in the world and I 've been a tremendous fan for years , \" Cohen was quoted as saying at the time .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.067566"}

Ted Cruz had a clear win and Democrat Hillary Clinton barely edged out Sanders .Trump is in for a nervous day as he waits to see whether he can turn support at huge rallies into votes after falling short of his polling numbers in Iowa last week .Marco Rubio 's stumble under New Jersey Gov. Christie 's ferocious fire at Saturday 's GOP debate , meanwhile , threatens to stall his momentum heading into New Hampshire , where the Florida senator looked likely to emerge as the top establishment candidate .For their part , Democrats are waiting to assess the magnitude of Sanders ' expected victory over Clinton , which could offer the anti - Wall Street crusader a boost heading into less hospitable territory in southern states .Campaigning for the primary drew to a close Monday with Trump and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush trading deeply personal taunts and Rubio trying to bounce back from his tough debate night .The latest CNN / WMUR daily tracking poll on Monday showed Sanders with a 26-point lead over Clinton .On the Republican side , Trump maintained the lead he has held for months , 31 % to next - best Florida Sen. Rubio with 17 % .Three - quarters of the polling was completed before Saturday 's debate , so it was unclear whether Rubio had been hurt by his rocky performance .Among other candidates , Cruz was third with 14 % , ahead of Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 10 % and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 7 % .Christie received 4 % , according to CNN 's tracking poll .The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.2 percentage points .The high number of undecided voters could make this a very fluid race .Despite his lowly position in the polls , Christie has spent the past few days basking in his debate assault on Rubio .Under pressure from the New Jersey brawler , Rubio repeated the same line four times during the debate , exacerbating criticisms that he is overly scripted .When the lights get that bright , you either shine or you melt , and we ca n't afford to have a president who melts , \" Christie said Monday at a campaign event in Hudson , New Hampshire .Christie , Bush and Kasich are hoping that Rubio 's rough night halts momentum he built up coming third in Iowa .A strong second place in the Granite State would enhance Rubio 's case that he is best - positioned to consolidate opposition to Trump and Cruz .Trump , for his part , hinted Sunday that he understands how crucial New Hampshire is to his campaign .I could say to you if I came in second and third I 'd be thrilled , okay ?I know all about expectations , \" Trump told CNN 's Dana Bash on Sunday .\" If I came in second I would n't be happy , okay ?Bush , who for once equaled or even got the better of Trump on the debate stage on Saturday , has been mounting a last stand in New Hampshire and on Monday lashed out at the former reality TV star on Twitter .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"94.18204"}
