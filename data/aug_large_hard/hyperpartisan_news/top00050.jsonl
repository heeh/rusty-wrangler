{"text":"The only two routes for Manning now are appeals and a pardon .The appeal option probably is n't terribly realistic , for a couple of reasons .First , as mentioned above , Manning admitted to a significant portion of the case , and his guilt in releasing the material has never been in doubt .Being found guilty on this basis is hardly a miscarriage of justice , at least in the trial - process sense .Given the scope of the crime , the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is n't likely to proclaim Manning a whistleblower , despite what his lawyer and Wikileaks ' fans think .This is n't a Pentagon Papers situation - Manning did n't discriminate in his leaks , but instead exposed seemingly everything within his grasp .Unfortunately for Manning , the pardon option is even less likely .First , there has n't been a President as parsimonious with pardons than Barack Obama .For instance , while Eric Holder has proclaimed prior prosecutions and sentencing in the war on drugs as unjust - an arguable position - Obama has n't done a thing to correct those implied specific injustices , at least not until now .With Obama in full pursuit of Edward Snowden , who has a better case to make as a whistleblower , he 's even more unlikely to cough up a pardon for someone who appears to have exposed American secrets out of spite .Manning will be waiting in Leavenworth for a long time for that pardon .According to a new statement from Manning , he 'd prefer to wait it out as Chelsea Manning and get sex - change therapy : .As I transition into this next phase of my life , I want everyone to know the real me .I am Chelsea Manning .I am a female .Given the way that I feel , and have felt since childhood , I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible .I hope that you will support me in this transition .I also request that , starting today , you refer to me by my new name and use the feminine pronoun ( except in official mail to the confinement facility ) .I look forward to receiving letters from supporters and having the opportunity to write back .Coombs said he is \" hoping \" that Fort Leavenworth \" would do the right thing \" and provide hormone therapy for Manning .\" If Fort Leavenworth does not , then I 'm going to do everything in my power to make sure they are forced to do so .\" The facility does not provide hormone therapy or sex - reassignment surgery for gender identity issues but does provide psychiatric care , a Fort Leavenworth spokeswoman told Courthouse News earlier this week .In the U.S. prison system , transgender prisoners who have not had genital surgery are generally assigned to live with their birth - sex peers , but the military policy is unclear .It 's going to a long and unhappy wait for Manning on all of these fronts .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"64.26408"}
