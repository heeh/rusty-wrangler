Goodin , Thomas Schillemans , ( 2012 ) .Abstract . Private-and public - sector employers face a recurring organizational - design dilemma : the relative emphasis to place on process - versus - outcome accountability in evaluating employee performance .This chapter reviews experimental - psychological research that emphasizes the benefits of process accountability and then notes blind spots in that literature , especially the insensitivity to the relational signals that accountability manipulations convey about how evaluators view the evaluated .The chapter also examines real - world ideologically - driven debates over accountability design in which partisans tend to favor no - excuses forms of outcome accountability for those deemed untrustworthy and uncertainty - buffering forms of process accountability for the trustworthy .Finally , an integrative framework is proposed that examines how managers can balance the inevitable tradeoffs between decision - making control enhanced under process accountability and innovation fostered under outcome accountability and sheds light on how agent empowerment can compensate for the deficiencies of both systems .Shefali Patil , Ferdinand Vieider , Philip Tetlock , \" Process and outcome accountability \" .In Oxford Handbook of Public Accountability , edited by Mark Bovens , Robert E.

Wal - Mart .It explains how the normal rules of evidence law should apply to social framework expert testimony , and under the flexible and permissive standards of the Federal Rules of Evidence , framework testimony offered by a qualified expert should be admissible in many employment class actions .The argument that this kind of evidence should always be excluded is driven as much by a particular view of employment discrimination law as by the governing evidentiary rules .Ultimately , the arguments for blanket exclusion of social framework testimony in these cases can best be understood as part of a political debate and a litigation strategy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.47987"}
