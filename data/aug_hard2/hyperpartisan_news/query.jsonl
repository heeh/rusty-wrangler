{"id":107,"label":"true","text":"Opinion Modal Trigger Voters\u2019 top concerns are the stagnant economy and the threat of terrorism, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from Hillary Clinton\u2019s TV ads or campaign speeches. She\u2019s trying to twist the presidential race into a referendum on political correctness. Too embarrassed to run on her party\u2019s economic record or her failed stint as secretary of state, she\u2019s positioning herself as top cop of the speech police. For example, Hillary is running an ad depicting pre-teen girls looking self-consciously in the mirror, agonizing over their bodies. Sometimes such young girls\u2019 worries turn into deadly eating disorders, ultimately killing 10 percent of those affected. Clinton cynically exploits the pain and fear felt by thousands of families. Her ad uses a voiceover of Trump saying things like \u201cshe ate like a pig\u201d and \u201cdoes she have a fat ass?\u201d Parents struggling with their child\u2019s eating disorder run to one doctor after another frantically seeking answers. The causes are complex and still not entirely known \u2014 but no one believes the cause is Donald Trump. Some experts blame Hollywood\u2019s glorification of skinny women for at least contributing to the rash of eating disorders and young girls\u2019 body-image struggles. Instead of trying to muzzle Trump and other men, why isn\u2019t Hillary calling out her big supporters in the entertainment industry? The same question applies to Hillary\u2019s double standard in bashing Trump for lewdness but celebrating it in popular music. Clinton\u2019s latest super PAC ads condemn Trump\u2019s bawdy 2005 remarks on a bus with show-biz journalist Billy Bush. Trump bragged to his buddy, \u201cI moved on her like a bitch.\u201d Clinton claims to have been outraged when she heard it, calling it \u201chorrific.\u201d Manhattan Institute scholar Heather Mac Donald chuckles at Clinton\u2019s hypocritical \u201csudden onset of Victorian vapors.\u201d After all, Clinton has no problem with the salacious lyrics of her pal and supporter Beyonc\u00e9. Even when Beyonc\u00e9 sings: \u201cI came to slay bitch . . . when he f\u2013k me good I take his ass to Red Lobster.\u201d Clinton says, \u201cI want to be as good a president as Beyonc\u00e9 is a performer.\u201d Trump can\u2019t catch a break with Clinton, even when he\u2019s trying to do the right thing. Another Clinton ad attacks Trump reaching out to inner-city African-Americans with promises of more jobs and school choice. Reminding minority voters that Democratic politicians have failed to improve their economic opportunities, Trump asks for their vote, saying: \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d Clinton\u2019s ad says: \u201cEverything.\u201d It follows her ad featuring Ku Klux Klan members praising Trump. It\u2019s McCarthyite guilt by association. Trump has no connection to the group. What\u2019s Trump actually guilty of? Poaching on Hillary\u2019s turf. Worse than tarring Trump, she\u2019s labeling cops, teachers and millions of other Americans racists. Whenever she talks to black audiences, she stokes racial resentment. She told the NAACP that whites \u201cneed to recognize our privilege and practice humility.\u201d All whites, she claims, have \u201cimplicit bias,\u201d and she wants bias training for police and other professions. Implicit bias \u2014 you\u2019re told you have it even if you don\u2019t realize it, no matter how colorblind you try to be, and denying your bias just proves it. Implicit bias is PC drivel. There\u2019s no solid data to support it, cautions social scientists Philip Tetlock of UPenn and Gregory Mitchell of the University of Virginia and experts from New York University and the University of Connecticut. But if Clinton becomes president, we\u2019ll all be undergoing re-education at school or work to cure our \u201cimplicit bias.\u201d To see what President Hillary\u2019s America would be like, look at most college campuses today. Few on campus dare to question Black Lives Matter, militant multiculturalism and \u201csafe spaces\u201d to spare students from challenging ideas. Hillary\u2019s dictating how Americans talk about race, sex, even body shapes. Trump calls it like he sees it. He doesn\u2019t stick to the well-rehearsed rhetoric of a career politician. But his supporters are sick and tired of political correctness. He\u2019s not running for saint. He\u2019s running to get the job done, something Hillary Clinton has already proven she can\u2019t do.

{"id":206,"label":"false","text":"Michael Douglas has jumped ahead of allegations he masturbated in front of a former employee, insisting he\u2019s not about to sit back and become the villain of a harassment story. The Basic Instinct star claims staff at both The Hollywood Reporter and Variety have reached out for feedback concerning accusations he pleasured himself in front of an employee three decades ago, and he\u2019s keen to get ahead of the story, before he joins the likes of Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K., Jeremy Piven, and Brett Ratner, among others, who have been accused of sexual misconduct. Douglas has turned to movie news website Deadline to set the story straight, stating, \u201cI felt the need to get ahead of this.\u201d Revealing that The Hollywood Reporter contacted him via his attorney regarding the woman\u2019s claims that he used \u201ccolourful language\u201d in front of her, \u201cspoke raunchily, or dirtily with friends of mine in private conversations on the phone\u201d. The woman\u2019s third claim was that the actor masturbated in front of her, to which Douglas responds, \u201cI remembered this woman: sophisticated intelligent, good sense of humour, a novelist, who has written books and published novels and was an active feminist, and proud of it. My head was reeling. I just couldn\u2019t put this together.\u201d Insisting she \u201ccould have excused herself\u201d if she was offended by the language he used in private conversations, Douglas adds the allegations he blackballed the unnamed women are \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d. He adds that the claims he masturbated in front of her are \u201ca complete lie, fabrication\u201d. According to the actor, the journalist at The Hollywood Reporter agreed to sit on the story over the holidays, but in the New Year the publication got back in touch and said, \u201c\u2018She\u2019s (accuser) running around, possibly trying to give this story to other people, so we\u2019re going to run with it\u2019. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s justification, just because you might get scooped, to run a story like this\u2019\u2026 I was floored,\u201d he continues. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say and I tried to digest it. The accusations are minimal, except of course for the idea of masturbating in front of her. She supposedly had three friends who would back her up, that she had mentioned this to\u2026 \u201cHow am I, in a 50 year career in this industry, dealing with an employee 33 years ago who perhaps is disgruntled that I let her go, even though I have never heard from her in 32 years. And a legitimate trade publication is going to try and print this story? There is no corroboration, just that they found out somebody else might run the story.\u201d Douglas calls the whole saga \u201cextremely painful\u201d, adding, \u201cI pride myself on my reputation in this business\u2026 I\u2019m bewildered why, after 32 years, this is coming out, now. \u201cThe part that hurt the worst is having to share something like this to your wife and your children. My kids are really upset, have to go to school worrying this is going to be in some article about me, being a sexual harasser. They\u2019re scared and very uncomfortable.\u201d Douglas also states this isn\u2019t \u201cthe New Year I had anticipated\u201d, adding he\u2019s worried the drama may affect upcoming work he has booked. \u201cI\u2019m fearful,\u201d he says. \u201cI have jobs going with studios who all seem to be supportive at this time. I\u2019m hurt, really hurt and offended and I wonder if people realize when you do something like this, it hurts a lot more than just one person.\u201d Play Video Play Loaded: 0% Progress: 0% Remaining Time -0:00 This is a modal window.

{"id":433,"label":"true","text":"Once this Harvey Weinstein debacle is completely finished, Hollywood will be a haven of racial, gender and financial equality. Ha, ha \u2014 right. The ongoing saga of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s downfall continues with news about the former mogul possibly being stripped of his Oscar. As police in New York and London investigate the many complaints against him of sexual assault, rumours persist that Weinstein will be booted from the Producers Guild of America. Meanwhile, the name of The Weinstein Company will be changed and Weinstein\u2019s name will be taken off future projects. Even the man\u2019s political contributions are being returned or handed over to women\u2019s charities. Other industry bigwigs and political leaders are being pilloried for not condemning Weinstein fast enough. His wife has left, his adult daughter feared he was suicidal, and people are lining up to savage the guy. Soon, he\u2019ll be drawn and quartered in a public place, no doubt. On the business side, it\u2019s been reported that The Weinstein Company is a shambles, with agents and talent trying to get themselves and their projects away from the bad smell, and upcoming films such as The Current War and The Upside in release limbo. The Financial Times says that Goldman Sachs is \u201cexploring options\u201d for its small stake in The Weinstein Company \u2014 and really, people, if the Goldman Sachs is taking the moral high ground, consider yourself toast. So why \u2014 just out of interest \u2014 is a 30-year problem coming to light now? Did we reach a tipping point? Was Mr. Weinstein\u2019s career in decline? Is there a power struggle nobody knows about in the offices of the company? Have we reached some sort of landmark in the ongoing saga of sexual impropriety and the war between men and women? Doubtful. Still, it\u2019s interesting that several formerly untouchable guys have been taken down recently, including Bill Cosby, Bill O\u2019Reilly, Roger Ailes and Donald Trump, that last dude being just a bit tougher to get rid of than the others. Why is the Weinstein case different? It\u2019s not as if Harvey Weinstein varies much from all the other handsy creeps in his business \u2014 oohhh, the names we\u2019d insert here \u2014 and casting couch stories have plagued the industry since Florence Lawrence first fluttered her eyelashes circa 1906. Some of the more interesting fallout from the Weinstein case involves the support weasels \u2014 every Weinstein staffer who knew things were rotten is under a cloud, and so is every agent, manager, casting agent, publicist or assistant who knowingly sent some poor girl to talk to Weinstein in a hotel room. And how about the lawyers who handled the hush money all those years? Be interesting to see who gets tackled next. Since Weinstein is no doubt just a difference in degree, not in kind, it\u2019s tough to say if this uproar will change anything on a permanent basis in his industry. Still, it would be interesting to know why Hollywood is such a sleazy place. The movie industry really is a cesspool of sexual harassment and bullying; hard to know how so many people go to work every day in such an atmosphere of fear and loathing. Many an analyst has decreed that vast amounts of money and power will do it every time, and maybe that\u2019s true \u2014 look at Dominique Strauss-Kahn, or Silvio Berlusconi, or even l\u2019il old home-grown Jian Ghomeshi. People will risk a lot to get anywhere near rich and famous, and an industry that allows ordinary people \u2014 capable of memorizing dialogue and playing make-believe \u2014 to be treated like gods is an industry in which every sort of predatory behaviour will no doubt thrive. How to explain the sexually predatory behaviour of men in every other industry is a bit more of a mystery. Play Video Play Loaded: 0% Progress: 0% Remaining Time -0:00 This is a modal window.

The singer got into such a heated argument with someone in the stands that the cops were called in to intervene before the situation escalated any further. The incident occurred at the Power 106 Celebrity Basketball Game at USC, reports TMZ. Video footage shows Brown becoming visibly upset as he leans over the bench seats to argue with a spectator. The music was too loud to make out exactly what words were exchanged, but USC cops can be heard saying, \u201c I don\u2019t care who\u2019s here, get it straight.\u201d Brown walked away twice but came back moments later each time to continue the quarrel, according to the Daily Mail. At one point, the R&amp;B singer was encircled by cops as he tried to explain the situation. Brown has become the latest high-profile star to join Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest against police brutality and racial inequality in America. Before the basketball game, Brown did not observe the anthem. Instead, Brown laughed with friends as he sat during the song\u2019s performance. The anthem was sung by R&amp;B singer Tank, who asked the audience to stand \u201cin the wake of 9\/11\u201d and in respect for those who lost their lives in the September 2011 terrorist attacks. However, Brown applauded Tank at the end for his effort. Brown was arrested just last week after a standoff with police officers at his Tarzana home over allegations he threatened a woman with a gun. During the event, Brown posted videos on social media in which he denounced the police and said he was being unfairly demonized."}
