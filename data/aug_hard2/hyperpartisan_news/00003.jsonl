Mayer , Jack and Harry Warner , Harry Cohn , William Fox , and Samuel Goldwyn were , each in his own way , bombastic , bullying personalities .And in today 's Hollywood tantrums are commonplace .But even in this context Harvey Weinstein stands out .At the Cannes Film Festival last May , Weinstein , who is six feet tall and weighs two hundred and fifty pounds , spotted Barry Diller , the chief executive of Vivendi Universal Entertainment .In a loud voice , he said to Diller , who is a fit five feet nine , \" Why 'd you call me a bully ? \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.5699"}
