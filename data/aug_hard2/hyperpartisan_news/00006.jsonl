A neuron communicates to other neurons by sending output pulses ( or \" spikes \" ) to other neurons .For simplicity , we only keep track of the rate $ r(i)$ of these spikes .Since a negative rate is n't meaningful , we know that $ r(i ) \\ge 0$. Only when the input exceeds some threshold $ I_0 $ does the neuron begin emitting output spikes .The output rate increases as $ i$ increases , as illustrated in this graph of $ r(i)$. ( The curve levels off for high values of $ i$ because there is a limit on how fast the neuron can emit output spikes .For example , the limit might be 200 spikes per second . )By differentiable , we mean that we can fit the graph of $ r(i)$ with a ( non - vertical ) tangent line .The graph of $ r$ has a kink there , so no matter what line we chose , it will fail to match the graph on either the left or the right side of $ I_0$. We can find a particular value of the slope $ m$ so that the line $ L(i)$ is a very good approximation for $ r(i)$ when $ i$ is close to $ a$. For this particular value of $ m$ , the line $ L(i)$ is called the the linear approximation to $ r(i)$ around $ a$. This line is , of course , the tangent line to $ r$. You 've learned other definitions of the derivative of a function , but you could just as well define it as the slope of this linear approximation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.990845"}

( The choice of the letter $ s$ comes from \" smoke . \" )Let 's pretend that the effect of nicotine is to shift the threshold $ I_0 $ to smaller values and flatten out a neuron 's response to input .We write the response of a neuron to input $ i$ and nicotine $ s$ as $ r(i , s)$.Applet loading .Neuron firing rate in response to input and nicotine levels .A fictitious representation of the firing rate $ r(i , s)$ of a neuron in response to an input $ i$ and nicotine level $ s$. The firing rate increases with input $ i$ , but it increases more slowly as $ s$ increases .The firing rate is zero below a threshold input that decreases with $ s$. This leads to a fold in the surface that describes the function $ r(i , s)$.One of the first things you may notice is that the surface $ r(i , s)$ is smooth except for a fold or crease along a line .This fold is compoosed of those points where , for a given nicotine level $ s$ , $ r(i , s)$ suddenly becomes nonzero as you increase the input $ i$. The fold is analogous to the kink at $ I_0 $ that we saw in the original curve , above .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.290146"}
