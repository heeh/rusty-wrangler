{"text": "Statistical natural language processing ( SNLP ) is a field lying in the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning .SNLP differs from traditional natural language processing in that instead of having a linguist manually construct some model of a given linguistic phenomenon , that model is instead ( semi- ) automatically constructed from linguistically annotated resources .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.50354"}
{"text": "Parallel text is the fuel that drives modern machine translation systems .The Web is a comprehensive source of preexisting parallel text , but crawling the entire web is impossible for all but the largest companies .We bring web - scale parallel text to the masses by mining the Common Crawl , a public Web crawl hosted on Amazon 's Elastic Cloud .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.66195"}
{"text": "We present KenLM , a library that implements two data structures for efficient language model queries , reducing both time and memory costs .The PROBING data structure uses linear probing hash tables and is designed for speed .Compared with the widelyused SRILM , our PROBING model is 2.4 times as fast ... \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.87781"}
