{"text": "Fiber steering is made possible by local compaction during placement of the fibers , with each of the impregnated tows having enough tack to overcome any sliding forces .It should be mentioned that when tows are steered through a radius , the fibers on the outside of the radius are placed in tension and the fibers on the inside of the radius are placed in compression .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.44129"}
