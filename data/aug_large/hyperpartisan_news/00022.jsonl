Ted Cruz and Donald Trump .Good luck finding anything else on which they agree .The immediate cause of this debate is Syrian President Bashar al - Assad : Should the U.S. be trying to unseat him , so that everyone can then focus efforts on destroying the Islamic State , or ISIS , caliphate that 's been established on Syrian territory ?Or has recent history shown that throwing out thugs and dictators like him merely opens the doors for the kind of chaos that sucks in American troops and creates problems worse than the ones the U.S. was trying to solve ?But this is hardly an argument about Syria alone .This may sound like a repeat of the debate over the realpolitik approach that Henry Kissinger and others took in the 1970s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.92457"}

{"text": "What this column is about starts with how Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz have both recently learned the same two lessons .The first is that it is not at all pleasant to face a competitor who 's as tough and mean as you are .In each case that competitor is Donald Trump .For Mr. Cruz the lesson hit home with the damage , however small or significant , caused by Mr. Trump 's putting forward the issue of Mr. Cruz 's constitutional eligibility , due to birth in Canada , for the presidency .Mr. Trump was particularly devilish : He did n't insist Mr. Cruz was ineligible but simply said , with an air of mock concern , that a President Cruz could bog the country down in years of court challenges .This was primo Doubt - Casting , aimed at giving potential Cruz supporters reservations .As for Mrs. Clinton , she has clearly been rattled by Mr. Trump 's merciless resurrection of her alleged complicity in the sometimes brutal handling of women involved in her husband 's dramas .This reminds everyone of - and introduces young voters , who were children during the Gennifer Flowers through Monica Lewinsky stories to - the whole sordid underside of Clintonism .Mrs. Clinton clearly was n't expecting it , and she bobbled .She has never gone up against a competitor like Mr. Trump .The second thing she and Mr. Cruz are both learning , I suspect , is something most people learn by their 20s : It matters what people think of you .It 's important that people have a high opinion of your essential integrity , trustworthiness and good faith .It matters that they like you .Mr. Cruz , when challenged by Mr. Trump , could have used some backup from prominent Republicans , but they did n't throw him a lifeline .John McCain : \" I am not a constitutional scholar on that , but I think it 's worth looking into .\" You know why Mr. Cruz had no backup ?Because almost no one who works with him likes him .They have n't experienced him as a trustworthy person of good faith .They waited , as people do , for a chance to hurt him , and when they got it they did .Mrs. Clinton 's reputational problems are evident in this week 's polls .On Tuesday , Monmouth University had her trailing Bernie Sanders by 14 points in New Hampshire .Quinnipiac had her down by five in Iowa .The Des Moines Register poll has her ahead there , but by only two points .The caucus is still two weeks away , but if Mrs. Clinton 's campaign is n't sinking , it 's obviously struggling .Democrats who like her all say the same thing : She 's having trouble because she 's not really good at campaigning .That 's true as far as it goes .She is especially poor at the podium , where , when she wants to emphasize an applause line , her voice becomes loud , flat and harassing to the ear .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.52627"}

Happersett ( 1875 ) , which held that Equal Protection did not protect the right of women to vote , affirming precedents finding that women 's proper place is in the domestic sphere .Similarly , the 24th Amendment banning poll taxes in federal elections overturned the Court 's 1937 decision in Breedlove v.

Bernie Sanders - a self - identified democratic socialist who scored a 95 % in the most recent ratings from the liberal organization Americans for Democratic Action - has pulled longtime favorite Hillary Clinton to the left on issues such as trade and taxes .In the Republican primary , the race is being dominated by Sen. Ted Cruz , a full - throated movement conservative , and billionaire Donald Trump , who holds a checkered ideological history but has moved steadily rightward on issues such as abortion , taxes and health care .Candidates generally considered more mainstream and moderate - former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich - lag well behind .The hole in the moderate middle is wide enough that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has begun pondering whether the conditions are right for a presidential run as an independent , centrist candidate , though history suggests such efforts are difficult at best .To some extent , it 's normal for primary elections to draw candidates toward the ideologically charged activists in their parties ' bases , who are the most energized players early in any campaign season .But the trend seems especially acute in the 2016 cycle .Here 's one big reason for that : More Americans actually are severing their ties to the two main parties , which they see as ineffective .In doing so , they are leaving the presidential primary process to be dominated by the more ideological activists of the left and right .A study of voter registration in the most politically competitive states by Third Way , a think tank of moderate Democrats , found that between the 2008 and 2014 election cycles , the share of Americans registered as independents grew by 17.4 % .Meanwhile , Democratic registration decreased by 4.8 % while Republican registration grew by just 3.3 % .Similarly , a new Gallup study released this month finds that 42 % of Americans now identify themselves as political independents , dwarfing the shares who call themselves Democrats ( 29 % ) or Republicans ( 26 % ) .We have two phenomena : a growth of independents and a growth of partisanship , \" says Lee Miringoff , who directs the Marist Poll . \" The Democrats and Republicans who remain identified with the parties are really baked into their positions . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.6857"}

Bush , faced the same kind of test in New Hampshire that his son faces now .He was the sitting vice president and the odds - on favorite to win not just the Republican presidential nomination but the presidency .Yet he lost the Iowa caucuses and faced an uncertain fate heading into the New Hampshire primary .The elder Mr. Bush won the primary , opening the way to securing the presidential nomination and winning the White House itself .Maybe lightning can strike for his son in New Hampshire as well .Jeb Bush 's campaign has severely underperformed expectations so far .He was an afterthought in Iowa , and seems to have no prospect of actually winning in New Hampshire or anywhere right now .To carry on now , though , he merely needs to show that there is still a place in this year 's race for an establishment Republican candidate , and that he has a chance to fill it .Going into Tuesday 's vote , says one veteran Republican strategist not associated with his campaign , Mr. Bush is \" all bunched up \" in the establishment candidate space with Florida Sen.

John Kasich - lag well behind .The hole in the moderate middle is wide enough that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has begun pondering whether the conditions are right for a presidential run as an independent , centrist candidate , though history suggests such efforts are difficult at best .To some extent , it 's normal for primary elections to draw candidates toward the ideologically charged activists in their parties ' bases , who are the most energized players early in any campaign season .But the trend seems especially acute in the 2016 cycle .Here 's one big reason for that : More Americans actually are severing their ties to the two main parties , which they see as ineffective .In doing so , they are leaving the presidential primary process to be dominated by the more ideological activists of the left and right .A study of voter registration in the most politically competitive states by Third Way , a think tank of moderate Democrats , found that between the 2008 and 2014 election cycles , the share of Americans registered as independents grew by 17.4 % .Meanwhile , Democratic registration decreased by 4.8 % while Republican registration grew by just 3.3 % .Similarly , a new Gallup study released this month finds that 42 % of Americans now identify themselves as political independents , dwarfing the shares who call themselves Democrats ( 29 % ) or Republicans ( 26 % ) .We have two phenomena : a growth of independents and a growth of partisanship , \" says Lee Miringoff , who directs the Marist Poll . \" The Democrats and Republicans who remain identified with the parties are really baked into their positions . \"Meanwhile , he says , \" we 're seeing a growth of independents who say this partisan show is n't for me .The picture could change , and moderates find a greater voice , once the calendar moves beyond the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire , which tend to be dominated by core activists .The voting population is more diverse in bigger states such as Florida , Minnesota , Michigan and Ohio , and chances seem good the races in both parties will continue long enough that primary voters in such states will have a say in the outcome this time .But then the question will rise anew in the general election .Traditionally , successful presidential candidates have tried to avoiding tacking so far to the left or right in the primary season that they compromise their ability to move back toward the center once the race to November is under way .It is n't clear such a course correction will be possible this time , given the stronger pull of the two parties ' ideological wings .Mr. Bush referred to the difficulty in this task when , more than a year ago , he told a Wall Street Journal conference of chief executives that a Republican candidate had to be willing to \" lose the primary to win the general \" election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.37262"}

Scott Walker of Wisconsin .Maybe it was inevitable .Of all the practicing politicians in the scramble , Walker is possibly the sloppiest public speaker .Compared with him , Chris Christie can be a pinnacle of verbal discipline .Last week , Walker was on a radio talk show , praising a law he signed requiring women who want an abortion to undergo an ultrasound .Which they 're supposed to watch , while the physician points out the features of the fetus .An ultrasound , he said , was \" just a cool thing .\" That Gail Collins describes the baby in the ultrasound as a fetus shows that she is n't coming at this from an unbiased perspective .How many women , when they see their first ultrasound , say \" Look at my fetus \" ?Are n't they most likely to say \" Look at my baby \" ?The whole reason why Wisconsin legislators passed that bill and Gov. Walker signed it into law is because a significant number of women that see their baby when they get an ultrasound decide not to get an abortion .There are 2 points that are essential to this article .First , it is n't coincidental that Gail Collins ' fury is directed at Scott Walker .When she wrote about Gov. Walker in February , she could n't be bothered with getting the facts straight .This was n't a difficult project .Anyone with a memory knew that Gov. Walker was n't elected until November , 2010 .Anyone with an ounce of professional pride would 've gotten that right .She did n't .Second , it 's clear that Ms. Collins is n't in touch with people in the heartland .Apparently , in Ms. Collins ' world , the widely held belief is that anyone who does anything that makes it more difficult to have an abortion is a Neanderthal .Anyone that can compare the stupid thing that Todd Akin said with what Scott Walker said is frightening .Games may have been played yesterday in connection with the week 's resounding media story .On Thursday morning , Politico media reporter Dylan Byers broke the story of George Stephanopoulos 's big - money donations to the Clinton Foundation ( at first they were reported as $ 50,000 but grew to $ 75,000 by day 's end ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.515686"}
