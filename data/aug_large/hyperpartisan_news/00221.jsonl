Rick Scott 's staff combed through the information of 80,000 registered voters to find out who was not an American citizen , and thereby ineligible to vote .Scott found only one individual on the list who was not an American citizen - more evidence that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent .Wang accentuated the importance of early registration and same - day registration as ways to increase participation .She stated that when North Carolina used early voting and same - day registration in the 2008 election , participation in the African - American community skyrocketed from 59 % in 2004 to 72 % in 2008 .Clarissa Martinez and Carmen Barkley continued the discussion , touching upon the barriers that Latino voters and young voters face .Martinez emphasized the need to combat suppression tactics and ensure that Latino communities are not confused with the election process .She advocated for the criminalization of deceptive practices and misinformation , which affect Latinos and recently naturalized citizens who may be unsure of how to navigate the voting process .Berkley , a campaigner for young people 's voting rights , stressed that since there are 46 million people under 29 who are eligible to vote this election , it is crucial to raise awareness and educate young people about the voting process .Many young people do not have a government issued ID or do not know the last four digits of their Social Security number , making them unqualified to vote in some states .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.302856"}

{"text": "As election law expert Rick Hasen has noted , there is a philosophical divide between the parties .Supposedly , for Republicans , small barriers to participation can help the functioning of a democracy .For instance , in recent years , Republicans have been pushing a requirement that voters present identification when they show up to cast a ballot .They argue that voter ID laws can prevent fraud and foster confidence in the electoral system .But they also argue that if an ID requirement deters people who are n't particularly well - informed or invested in the political process , this might be a net benefit for the electoral system .The Democratic philosophy is different .For Democrats , universal participation is a value : All voices ought to be represented in the electoral sphere , so the government should not put up any unnecessary barriers to participation .Debates over issues like voter ID are politically explosive because each side suspects the other of having a strategic motive , not a philosophical one , for its position .Maybe Republicans want lower turnout not because it yields an informed electorate , but because it favors their side .Maybe Democrats promote higher turnout not because of an ideological commitment to civic engagement , but because higher turnout helps elect Democrats ( though there is substantial disagreement on whether that is true ) .Nowhere are the strategic motivations -- and the hypocritical rhetoric -- of both parties more apparent than in the timing of elections .The election calendar in the United States is an insane mess .Exhibit A is New Jersey .New Jersey holds federal elections with the rest of the country on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of even - numbered years .But elections for state office in New Jersey are held in November of odd - numbered years .School district elections are held on the third Tuesday in April or else in November .And fire district commissioner elections are held on the third Saturday in February .It is n't just New Jersey .Most states -- 44 out of 50 -- hold some state and local elections off the federal cycle .Why ?Political scientist Sarah Anzia , a professor at the University of California , Berkeley , gives a compelling explanation in an outstanding book published last year .The first point that Anzia makes is that the off - cycle election calendar is not a response to voter preferences ; voters do not like taking multiple trips to the voting booth .Voters of all political stripes prefer consolidated elections , and by wide margins .But that 's especially true for people who identify as Democrats , who prefer consolidated elections 73 percent to 27 percent .Consolidation is popular , and during the decade - long period between 2001 and 2011 that Anzia studied , state legislatures across the country considered over 200 bills aimed at consolidating elections .About half , 102 bills , were focused specifically on moving school board election dates so that they would coincide with other elections .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.16996"}

{"text": "[ 30 ] Yet the Center now wants to use those same supposedly inaccurate databases to register voters automatically .As Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler pointed out during a January 2013 discussion at The Heritage Foundation , there is no question that there are inaccuracies in state voter registration rolls .However , federal databases are also riddled with errors that may eclipse inconsistencies at the state level .It is important to note that state registration lists are transparent - such lists are available to candidates , political parties , and the public - but federal databases lack such transparency , and election officials and the public therefore can not verify the accuracy of such lists .Gessler has witnessed many inaccuracies in Social Security Administration information as well as the National Change of Address ( NCOA ) database used by the U.S. Postal Service .For example , the NCOA reports a move only if an individual informs the Postal Service of a move .Errors can also occur if the NCOA database classifies everyone at a particular address as having moved when only one person in the household has moved .The Brennan Center says that many of these government databases \" already include all the information necessary to determine voter eligibility , and those that do not can easily be modified to include that information .\" [ 31 ] However , as just one example , many of these databases do not contain citizenship information - a basic requirement for eligibility to vote .Organizations such as the Brennan Center have opposed states requiring proof of citizenship from registrants that would provide \" that information .\" Even worse , in 2012 , a number of civil rights organizations and the Department of Justice sued Florida in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the state 's verification of citizenship status through database comparisons .[ 32 ] Florida had to sue the federal government to get access to Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) immigration databases to which it is entitled under federal immigration law to get citizenship information .DHS has also fought states through administrative measures , such as using bureaucratic red tape to prevent states from accessing its own databases - something Secretary Gessler experienced firsthand in Colorado .MVR makes maintenance of existing registration lists even more difficult .The VEA introduced by Representative Lewis would make it difficult - even more so than it already is - for states to maintain accurate voter registration lists .For example , the legislation would amend the NVRA to prevent states from requiring further documentation of new registrants - documentation , such as proof of citizenship , that might be needed to determine eligibility .Section 104 of the bill requires states to register anyone who has provided the state with a \" valid voter registration form \" that has been \" completed \" and \" attested \" by the applicant .The bill also prohibits the \" transfer \" of information from \" the computerized Statewide voter registration list to any source agency .\" [ 33 ] Election officials would not even be allowed to retain the \" identity of the specific source agency through which an individual consented to register to vote \" after the individual is added to the statewide voter registration list .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.150597"}

Paul then went one step further by stating that there is n't any evidence that suggests Blacks are barred from voting any more than Whites .Speaking at the Louisville Forum , Sen. Paul mentioned that the historic Voting Rights Act was placed into law for sound reasons and that the federal government should still oversee the violation of individual voting rights , reports WFPL .But according to Sen. Paul , African Americans are clearly no longer disenfranchised at the polls : .The interesting thing about voting patterns now is in this last election , African Americans voted at a higher percentage than Whites in almost every one of the states that were under the special provisions of the federal government .So really , I do n't think there is objective evidence that we 're precluding African Americans from voting any longer .And while census numbers back up the senator 's statement , with Blacks voting at 66 percent when compared to 64 percent for Whites , it also must be noted that one of the chief catalysts of African - American voter turnout in 2012 was voter suppression .With Republican lawmakers pushing last - minute voter ID laws to seemingly stifle the Black vote , African Americans showed up at the polls in unprecedented numbers .Romney won the White vote 58 - 41 ( 2008 : John McCain won 52 - 46 ) .Romney won White men 63 - 36 ( 2008 : McCain won 53 - 45 ) .Romney won White women at about the same margin as four years ago , 53 - 46 .But the White vote overall was 79 percent of the turnout , down 4 points from 2008 ( White men : 3 points ; White women : 1 point ) .The Ohio population is about 84 percent white .Ohio has a low percentage of Hispanic population ( 3 percent ) compared to the national average ( 17 % ) and the exit polling had the Hispanic vote at 3 percent , a 1-point decrease from 2008 .Obama made up the margin by turning out the African - American vote , which increased from 11 percent in 2008 to 15 percent yesterday .He won these voters 96 - 4 and the higher turnout more than made up for any slight movement from his 2008 97 - 2 margin .What 's more notable , African Americans make up 12 percent of the Ohio population , but they represented a higher share of the electorate yesterday .In addition , Republican - dominant state legislatures have been rushing to get new Voter ID and other voting law adjustments passed into law ahead of critical election cycles in 2014 and 2016 .And with the High Court taking away the Justice Department 's ability to approve these sweeping changes to voting rights , critics of the new voting laws allege this is nothing more than another attempt to undermine and disrupt the Black vote .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.98634"}

Marion County Election Board , the US Supreme Court held that a state has an interest both in preventing voter fraud and in enhancing public confidence in the integrity of elections .Kansas ' actions also will have the effect of bolstering the enforcement of federal immigration and voting laws that the Obama administration does not care to enforce .An interesting contrast can be made with Takoma Park , Maryland , where that city , for reasons of its own , has determined that non - citizens are eligible to vote in its elections .Because non - citizens are not eligible to vote in any other Maryland elections , Takoma Park has to have a separate list to keep track of non - citizen registrations .In other words , Takoma Park has instituted a dual registration system .Its efforts have not drawn the attention of either the DOJ or the ACLU , presumably because its system is intended to make it possible for non - citizens to vote .This suggests that the problem that the ACLU has with Kansas ' system is not with the fact that it is a dual registration system , but with its purpose .Kansas ' dual registration system is both legal and sensible .Robert Popper is a senior attorney with Judicial Watch and serves as the head of that organization 's Election Integrity Project .He previously worked for eight years as Deputy Chief of the Voting Section in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice , in which capacity he garnered numerous professional awards .Legal and Sensible : Kansas ' Dual Voter Registration System .Its decision must be understood within the larger context of the ongoing battle between the Obama administration and the states over the enforcement of both our immigration laws and our election integrity laws .Bluntly put , the administration has drastically scaled back , and to some extent abandoned , its immigration - related enforcement efforts .Worse , it has started lawsuits against states that seek to take up the slack by enforcing federal immigration laws within their borders .US Senator Jeff Sessions has put together a helpful timeline of the Obama administration 's \" War on Immigration Enforcement .\" It is worth reading in its entirety , but to get a sense of this administration 's priorities a few highlights stand out : .In 2009 , the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security told employers and pro - amnesty groups that \" we 're not doing raids or audits under this administration . \"In January 2012 , a report by the Inspector General revealed that officials of the US Citizenship and Immigration Service ( USCIS ) pressured employees to approve applications that should have been denied .In April 2012 , the administration announced that it would reduce National Guard troops stationed at the border from 1,200 to 300 .That same month , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) officials offered to voluntarily close over 16,500 deportation cases pending background checks .In December 2012 , ICE implemented an astonishing new policy that barred its agents from detaining unlawfully present aliens for illegally entering the country or for having false papers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.245834"}

{"text": "ALBUQUERQUE - A state legislator is pushing for voter identification requirements in New Mexico .Cities and state around the country have enacted voter ID legislation .It 's required in Albuquerque during city elections , and people in Hobbs recently passed a similar law .Anybody who 's not voting accurately by who they say they are , that 's too many , \" Republican Rep. James Smith told KRQE News 13 .Smith filed a bill that would require voters to produce government - issued photo IDs with some exceptions .People who do n't bring their ID could still vote if they gave a social security number and date of birth .Smith 's proposal would change not only how you vote in person , but also by mail .Federal lawsuits against North Carolina claim that recent changes to the state 's election laws will \" suppress \" minority votes .For example , in N.C. State Conf . of NAACP v. McCrory , plaintiffs assert that the new laws \" impose a disproportionate burden on the ability of African Americans to vote \" and will \" raise costs for voters and deter participation .\" They highlight testimony by a former director of the State Board of Elections who asserted that the laws will \" ultimately reduc[e ] turnout in comparison to comparable elections .Turnout data for the 2014 election , posted Dec. 10 on the state 's Board of Elections website , tell a different story .Black turnout and registration for the November 2014 election increased by every relevant measure compared with November 2010 , the last non - presidential general election .Last July , North Carolina adopted electoral reforms that eliminated same - day registration , reduced the number of days of early voting to 10 from 17 , and required ballots to be cast in a voter 's home precinct .It also instituted a voter - ID requirement that will take full effect in 2016 .Two sets of plaintiffs , led by the NAACP and the League of Women Voters , sued in federal court on Aug. 12 , 2013 .They were followed a few weeks later by the Justice Department .Attorney General Eric Holder asserted that the state 's new laws would restrict \" access and ease of voter participation \" and \" would shrink , rather than expand , access to the franchise .All three suits alleged that the reforms will inflict \" burdens \" on North Carolina voters -- and in particular , on minority voters .These allegations were backed by reams of expert reports submitted by social scientists predicting that these burdens would depress voter registration and turnout .One expert in the Justice Department lawsuit claimed that more than 200,000 black voters , along with 700,000 white voters , would be \" burdened \" in an off - year election .Another expert concluded that particular provisions \" will lower turnout overall \" and \" will have a disparate impact on African - American voters .Those predictions were not borne out .The 2014 elections were the first test of the impact of North Carolina 's new laws , including a \" soft rollout \" of its voter - ID requirement -- under which poll workers asked voters if they had ID and if not , to acknowledge the new requirement in writing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.18347"}
