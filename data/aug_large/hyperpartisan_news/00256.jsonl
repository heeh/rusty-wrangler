{"text": "Such a scandal resulted in much media time and pundit / comic commentary but the truth is Clinton still went about his professional business and people still went to work , being effected by partisanship decision making by elected officials .Likewise , WikiLeaks has resulted in just Media attention that has thus far amounted to gossip attention from Partisanship pundits and focus on Assange the person .Such has been the majority measurable response to WikiLeaks .Does anyone focusing on Assange know about the fate of the soldiers who were involved in the now infamous Collateral Murder release ?SEATTLE , Washington - Two more US soldiers face hearings this week over a rogue army unit that allegedly executed Afghan civilians , mutilated the corpses , then beat another soldier for blowing the whistle .[ 1 ] .Actually , it is important , in the purpose of this debate , what effect WikiLeaks is having on the society it is providing information for .So is all mainstream media .So is the entertainment industry .While the quality of the information provided by WikiLeaks is of a different caliber , it can as well be stated that the decades old media in place is doing a ' better job ' of providing information to the public than WikiLeaks .What does that mean ?It means that while there are many contradictions and revelations within many of the releases , there is no provided analysis .That has been left to the public - which benefits the already established media institutions and does more harm than good to the public because of the vehement partisan spin placed on WikiLeaks and Assange .More attention is placed upon the day to day soap opera that is the Assange prosecution efforts than upon any of the releases .And is there any guarantee that once a lie is revealed that responsibility will be enforced ?As alluded to earlier , the Collateral Murder release has resulted only in attention being placed upon the participants within the video .Not the system that has created the mentality of the soldiers in the war environment .The actions can be analogized with sweeping the issue underneath the rug .There are many instances where the public has discovered that it has been lied to and nothing happened save for media attention that was left in favor of the new ' big story ' .So what we are seeing here is just another scandal that is being misdirected and misrepresented for the majority public that has no influence upon a political system that has been ' entrusted ' to make the decisions of society for them .Socratic question # 1 : I have described how wikileaks benefits us by helping others to make abuses of power known , and sending a message to wrong - doers that their lies will be revealed .In what way are you suggesting that our knowledge of these things is harmful ?I am not necessarily suggesting our knowledge of them is harmful .I am not merely suggesting , but stating , that the manner WikiLeaks has gone about releasing the documents has not factored in the very real discrepancy of the average citizens capacity to interpret , much less act upon , the information that has been released .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.8032"}

Public to have it .So ... .Socratic question # 2 : You agree that it is better to know .And yet in a previous paragraph you asked me how it 's better to know the truth , and accuse me of perspective borne of ideology not fact .How do you reconcile this ?Easily .I have stated before that the public is still at the whim of the decisions that their elected officials make which is often times decided upon through corporate interaction .Knowing the truth , from the perspective of the majority populace does not necessitate that corrective action will occur .I can say peace and love all day , referencing my environment , but I am not actually describing my environment .The debate topic is not centered upon the ideological mission of WikiLeaks it is upon whether or not WikiLeaks is doing more harm than good .I am referring to the idea that an instance or two of catching wrong doing does not necessarily reflect the entirety of our system nor does it necessarily reflect the aspects of the system that has resulted in these behaviours and actions .The ' greater problem ' is how the population is informed and how that information is spun into partisan arguments resulting in constant argument while these instances continue to occur .It is more relevant , in my opinion , to focus on the populace and how they have historically reacted to scandal and as well take a look at how our elected officials and other leaders have dealt with the same .Save for a few aspects of our system , such as Supreme Court Appointees , our leadership is a revolving door .There is a laundry list of scandal in America alone , known and unknown , and while these issues are best known the result is just another person to fill in the shoes of the publicly shamed .The same lobbying efforts occur , wargames are still played , assumptions on what is best for our nation is constantly being influenced by presumed threats , real or unreal .This will always be the case but the process that our elected officials utilize in their campaigns are centered on basic rhetoric that assumes what is best for the average citizen - assumptions which differ depending on party , religion and so forth .WikiLeaks has been played by the media to this extent , providing information to the public based on terrorist assumptions and extending that accusation to Assange and his organization .WikiLeaks is not benefiting the public because WikiLeaks will never have full access to the attention of the full public and as of current there is no real expression from WikiLeaks save for leaked documents .Which allows for the partisan media to spin it and divert attention .As a result , inadvertently as it may be , WikiLeaks is perpetuating the partisan divide inherent in the pre - WikiLeaks media .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.5805"}
