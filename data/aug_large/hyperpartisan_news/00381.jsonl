{"text": "They found nothing .According to the Washington Times article , unnamed pilots said they know they are being \" probed \" by terrorists and that background checks are run on passengers when they begin engaging in suspicious activity during a flight .Federal Air Marshal spokesman Adams says Smith did exactly the right thing .\" She should report it to flight attendants .Then the flight attendants need to evaluate the information .\" If a passenger still has concerns , he should report them to the TSA at the airport or to local police , Adams says .\" We encourage people to report any type of suspicious activity .In fact , the sooner the information is provided to authorities , the better .\" But just saying that 's the right thing to do does n't mean much of anything if , as in Smith 's case , the agencies do n't appear to be listening .Smith 's report was not taken in depth until she put herself out over and over again to try to talk to someone in authority -- to , as she put it , \" just get it down on paper somewhere . \"Annie Jacobsen laughs when told of David Adams 's advice on reporting possible terrorist activity . \" Dave Adams is the guy who told me I had untrained civilian eyes . \"And , in fact , when talking with the Press , Adams used that same phrase to explain that these \" untrained eyes \" may not understand the difference between actions that are a little out of the norm and those that are dangerous .In the case of the Middle Eastern men aboard Flight 327 , Adams says : \" They did n't do anything illegal .They did n't do anything that was disruptive for the safety of the aircraft .They did n't interfere with the flight crews . \"He says the wise law enforcement response was to interview them after the flight and determine what they 'd been doing .Adams insists that they \" have no information that there is widespread probing of any of our commercial aircraft .However , we would be in the wrong business to think that there 's a possibility that it 's not taking place .\" Possibility versus probability : Congress did n't want to dance around this one , and launched an inquiry into \" security gaps \" aboard aircraft following Jacobsen 's story .And untrained eyes or not , Jacobsen 's account , backed up by other passengers and by the facts of the case , persuaded Congress that perhaps the Federal Air Marshals were n't quite as on top of things as they 'd like to think .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.40008"}
{"text": "I 've realized that by playing around with certain combinations , I can use many of my Eagle Creek packing cubes , sacs , etc . in the Tri - Star without having to buy new packing cubes .... helps save a little money , for now .Oh , good ...I could n't afford to get the TriStar packing cubes this time ( my order including steel / solar TriStar was $ 360 ... yikes ! )and I was hoping that I 'd be able to use my existing Eagle Creek packing cubes for now .What combination did you find would work well , if you do n't mind me asking ?On the zipper vs. cord pulls : Having the choice to use either is good .I would keep the zipper pulls on the main compartments so I could use a lock if necessary and put cord pulls on the side pockets myself .Luggage is inherently not very secure .The hard - shelled variety is somewhat more tamper - resistant than the soft - sided versions , though most of the integrated locks that you 'll find are easily compromised .And although zipper sliders can be locked together ( with a hasp - style slider such as pictured at right , or simply by passing a padlock through holes in the slider tabs ) , this will prevent casual pilferage only ; it presents little deterrent to the knowledgeable miscreant .It 's then an easy matter to ( 3 ) reach into the bag and remove all but very large items .Positioning the sliders at a corner of the bag facilitates the initial separation step , and also permits a larger opening .With a coil zipper ( the most common type ) , bag entry is simpler still : push the slider(s ) all the way to one end , then press the point of a ballpoint pen firmly into the centre of the closed zipper track .This will separate the intertwining coils ( without damaging them ) , making it trivial to open the bag fully by simply pulling the zipper track apart in both directions .Coil zippers are designed to self - heal easily , so can be restored to their original condition merely by pulling a slider backward ( occasionally with a bit of help from you , holding the coils together ) , thus rejoining the halves .Both of these techniques , of course , are handy to know should you ever be stuck with a locked bag to which you have lost the key or combination , or that has become jammed or otherwise inoperable .I have tried both with my Aeronaut and he is correct .I just use \" bread ties \" to keep the zippers from coming loose in transit and keep an eye on my bag at all times .Except Gary , I only lock the zippers when on a crowded train and I need to go to the loo or want to get a cup of coffee and I do n't want to drag my bag with me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.19724"}
{"text": "I made my request , mentioned the two trips that I have already purchased tickets for in January , and informed Northwest that these two trips would put me in excess of 50,000 miles in a 10 month time frame .To their credit , Northwest responded quickly .The first response informed me about an exciting opportunity to earn gold status by flying 5 round trips in certain fare classes in the first 90 days of 2008 .Of course that would be great if I ever flew in those fare classes .When I responded that would not help me and that my company would not be willing to pay more for a ticket so I could have a particular fare class , I got a \" we make no exceptions \" response .I was told that the only way to earn gold elite status is to fly the right number of miles in a CALENDAR year , not just in a 12-month timeframe .This seems crazy to me and their \" no exceptions \" response is insulting .I know they must get many requests and I would n't expect them to grant all of them .I certainly did n't expect ( or request ) the silver status they gave me in the years I did n't travel much .My final response to them has been sent .In that response I pointed out that they were willing to make exceptions when I did n't travel often and did n't request it but would n't consider a request when I was actually giving them a lot of business .That seems backwards to me .I also have made two offers to discuss this and my other concerns about Northwest customer service with anyone who is interested .I included my phone number each time .After the last response from Northwest , I contacted another airline that flies the routes that I travel most frequently .If they are willing to grant me status in their frequent traveler program , I will be switching my business .My husband is also a gold level traveler ( was platinum last year ) and he is also considering making a switch based on Northwest customer service .Northwest has disappointed me for some time with the level of service they provide in flight and the nickel and dime approach to amenities .When I have had to travel other airlines this year , I have been impressed by how much better the service is .If Northwest does n't reconsider , I have very little reason to stay .I am amazed by how little the airlines seem to care about their customers .Clearly the airlines that have figured this out ( Southwest , JetBlue ) are the only ones doing well .Why are the large carriers having such a hard time understanding such simple concepts ?This is EASY stuff to fix and they just seem unwilling to address a growing problem .MINNEAPOLIS , MINNESOTA -- I used to fly NW a lot way back when , but have n't much in the last few years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.537"}
