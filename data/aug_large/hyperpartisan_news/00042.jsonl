Jeff Sessions ( R - Ala . ) pressed Mueller to divulge the scope and goal of the FBI 's investigation into the IRS matter , but the director provided only minimal details .He said a dozen agents were assigned to the case and that it was being directed out of the Washington field office .\" There is a sense of urgency with the investigation , \" he said .\" It is not languishing .\" The current Director of the FBI , Robert Mueller , was appointed by George W.

Bush was the first host of FOX News Sunday .Diane Sawyer anchored ABC 's World News Tonight for five years after serving as a press aide to Richard Nixon .So Scarborough 's sweaty insistence that no one can name such people is demonstrably false .Scarborough kept switching from asking for on - air - personalities to executives in charge of the news operations .On that front there are right - wingers like David Rhodes , the current President of CBS News who had the a similar position at Fox for fifteen years .Ken Jautz , the head of CNN , is the man who gave Glenn Beck his first job on television .NBC is now owned by Comcast , whose Roberts family owners are notorious righties .There are certainly more conservatives in television newsrooms , but it 's hard to pin them down with proof .That 's because most career journalists are careful to avoid any open expression of partisanship .And the same is true for journalists who are accused of being liberals .That does n't mean they are n't there .And it does n't warrant the loony outburst that Scarborough let loose today .If anything , the fact that no one at the table could cite any of the people mentioned above is proof that the media is conservative , and blind to their bias .Donald Trump 's campaign promised that his speech today would provide details of his foreign policy agenda .The location he chose for the address was the deck of the USS Iowa battleship currently docked in San Pedro , California .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.445755"}
{"text": "But just below the surface , I ca n't help but wonder just how much Cruz knows about Reagan 's foreign policy .The water crisis in Flint , Michigan , is not a political story , per se .It 's a man - made catastrophe affecting real people and endangering a real community .Families who have to fear the water coming out of their tap in their own home probably could n't care less about election results , talking points , or the latest pitch from a public - relations agency .When you 're worried about your safety and that of your children , politics must seem very small .That said , Flint 's crisis is n't a natural disaster ; it 's a disaster that was imposed on the city by politicians .It 's difficult to separate politics from the scandal because it was the decisions from political officials that created the crisis in the first place .Gov. Rick Snyder 's popularity and job approval numbers have plummeted as a result of the Flint drinking water catastrophe , with 69 % of those surveyed saying the Republican governor has handled the crisis poorly .[ ... ] .Snyder , who was re - elected to a second term in late 2014 with 51 % of the vote , had a 45 % approval rating last summer .His favorability ratings are also now underwater .Most Michigan voters , who also elected a Republican - led legislature in the last cycle , are not , however , eager to see the governor forced from office .The same poll found that 29 % of those surveyed want Snyder to resign , while 61 % do not .As additional details come to light about culpability in this scandal , that number may yet change .After a year of chatter , the political world has finally reached the point at which actual voters will express actual preferences in the presidential race in ways that will actually matter .The Iowa caucuses are four days away ; the New Hampshire primary is 12 days away .On the eve of actual voting , polls can help offer valuable clues about late surges .Never mind what the results showed months ago ; what matters now is whether a candidate is closing strong .Plenty of candidates have won Iowa , quickly overcoming significant deficits , and surveys from this stage in the process often let us know which candidates are making gains as voters make up their minds .So , where do things stand ?Let 's start with the Hawkeye State , where there are two major new Republican surveys to consider .The new NBC News/ Wall Street Journal /Marist poll has the race shaping up this way : .Donald Trump : 32 % ( up from 24 % in early January ) .Ted Cruz : 25 % ( down from 28 % ) .Marco Rubio : 18 % ( up from 13 % ) .Ben Carson : 8 % ( down from 11 % ) .Trump 's 32 % showing is the strongest support any Republican has had in Iowa from this poll all cycle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.83562"}
