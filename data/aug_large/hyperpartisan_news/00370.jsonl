{"text": "Because sex toys are made of different materials -- silicone , rubber , vinyl , metal , etc .-- they must be cleaned in different ways .Be sure to read the instructions on the package insert to see how to clean your toy properly .As with other forms of sex , making sex toy play safer involves using a barrier to prevent each person 's bodily fluids from touching the other person .The best way to keep dildos , vibrators , and butt plugs clean is to use them with a latex condom .Be sure to use a fresh condom whenever the toy is used by a different person or in a different location ( e.g. , moves from vagina to anus or vice - versa ) .Having sex toys that are not shared and only used by one person can reduce the chances of passing STDs between partners .However , it is still important to clean the toy after each use and to use a fresh condom whenever the toy is used in a different location .It also helps to use lube with sex toys , both to enhance pleasure and to reduce damage to the tissues that line the vagina , mouth , anus , and rectum .Do not use oil - based lubes like Vaseline , Crisco , shea butter , or baby oil with latex condoms because they weaken condoms and make them more likely to break .Also , do not use silicone - based lube with silicone sex toys , as it will destroy the sex toy .Fisting , Handballing , or Fingering .Paper cuts and other openings in the skin can make your hands vulnerable to infection .Wearing latex or nitrile gloves keeps you protected during hand - vagina , hand - penis , or hand - anus sex .Adding water- or silicone - based lube to the outside of the gloves can increase your partner 's pleasure .It can be helpful to limit the time and frequency of insertive sex .Repeated or rough vaginal , anal , and oral sex play can cause damage to the linings of these areas .Since these linings are the body 's protection against STDs , damaging or tearing them will increase the chance that being exposed to an infected bodily fluid of another will result in infection .Try non - insertive sex .For example , consider hugging , touching , massage , or mutual masturbation ( touching each other 's genitals ) .Also get medical attention for any infections or health problems in the genital area .Sometimes the safest thing you can do in sex is have a clear head .When you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol , you are more likely to make bad decisions and have unsafe sex .It is also a good idea to plan ahead : get your safer sex items ( condoms , dental dams , gloves , lube , etc . ) before you find yourself in a sexual situation .That way , you have what you need to protect yourself whenever the need arises .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.342545"}

{"text": "Unfortunately , notes Michael McGee , vice president for education at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , programs today are judged almost exclusively according to \" whether they feature abstinence , rather than whether they promote health .\" Supporters of abstinence - only education won a major victory in 1996 , when Congress committed $ 250 million in federal funds over five years to promote abstinence until marriage as part of welfare reform .6 Nevertheless , in recent years it has been primarily at the state and local levels where opponents of sexuality education have concentrated their efforts and where they have had their greatest impact .According to many sex education supporters , their opponents are putting enormous pressure on school boards to curtail sexuality education programs and are intimidating school administrators and teachers , who in turn are becoming increasingly cautious about what they teach , even when they are under no formal constraints .\" These are dark times for balanced , responsible sexuality education , \" concludes Barbara Huberman , director of training at Advocates for Youth .SEXUALITY EDUCATION TODAY .Efforts to undermine sexuality education are not new , of course .Sex education has been a target of right - wing groups since the 1960s , when the John Birch Society and other ultraconservative organizations charged that such programs were \" smut , \" \" immoral \" and \" a filthy communist plot .\" The goal of these groups was to eliminate all sex education in schools , and they clearly had an impact : By the early 1970s , legislatures in 20 states had voted to restrict or abolish sexuality education .8 By the end of the decade , only three states ( Kentucky , Maryland and New Jersey ) and the District of Columbia required schools to provide sex education .But , as SIECUS president Debra Haffner notes , \" the landscape changed dramatically with the advent of AIDS . \"\" There is now no doubt , \" Koop wrote in his 1986 report , \" that we need sex education in schools and that it [ should ] include information on heterosexual and homosexual relationships .The lives of our young people depend on our fulfilling our responsibility .\" The states responded quickly : By the late 1980s , many states required schools to provide instruction about AIDS and other STDs .Some of these states also required instruction in sexuality education .In addition , since 1988 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) have provided financial and technical assistance to state and local education agencies , national organizations and other institutions to improve HIV education in schools .As of December 1997 , 19 states and the District of Columbia had laws or policies that required schools to provide sexuality education , and 34 states and the District mandated instruction about HIV , AIDS and other STDs ( Table 1 ) .Table 1 .Distribution of U.S. states and District of Columbia , by state policy requirements for sexuality , STD and HIV / AIDS education , 1998 .Source : See reference 11 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.57948"}

Gilmore on the grounds that the decision of whether to offer sex education should be left to local school boards .According to dozens of sexuality education proponents interviewed for this report during the latter half of 1997 and in early 1998 , the push for abstinence - only education is only the most visible element of a larger conservative strategy to eliminate more comprehensive programs .Other proposals include eliminating coeducational classes and changing the parental consent process in ways that sex education proponents warn could make participation in sex education more complicated for students and costly for schools .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.995895"}

Wade was decided and states started passing such laws requiring either parental consent or notification .The court has been looking at these cases since 1976 .It has looked at them one way or the other about 10 times .So New Hampshire had guideposts on how to set up a constitutional parental notification law .What is at issue tomorrow is the fact that New Hampshire did not do that .They can go to court and talk to a judge about it , show that they 're mature , and that they can make this decision , or that otherwise the decision to terminate their pregnancy is in their best interests .And in this case , it 's undisputed in the record that teenagers , like women in general , have medical emergencies that come up in connection with pregnancies , and some of those are emergencies that could cause permanent and severe harm to their health .Just a few : preeclampsia ; a type of pregnancy - induced hypertension that can be very dangerous to a pregnant woman ; severe infection of the placental lining , pelvic infections related to pregnancy ; heavy bleeding from the uterus .If these types of conditions do not receive immediate medical attention - not the time to get a lawyer and go to court and talk to the judge , but immediate medical attention - can cause damage to major organs , particularly the liver and the kidneys .They can cause , at times , the spread of infection , loss of vision , permanent loss of fertility and chronic pain .What New Hampshire failed to do here is make sure that minors who are in such emergencies - and are they going to be most minors in the state of New Hampshire ?No .Most minors in New Hampshire are going to be able to comply with what the law says .They are going to tell their mom or dad , or they are going to go to court and talk to a judge about why , in their family situation , that 's not appropriate for them , but that they are mature enough to make this decision .In an emergency situation , however , a woman needs to go to a doctor , not to the courthouse .This case reminds us , and I think it 's important for that reason too , that pregnancy is a major physical and medical event in a woman 's life .Sometimes , with all this debate around the constitutionality of abortion and questions about abortion rights and the religious debates about abortion , we forget that it is a major medical event .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.28085"}

Alice Peisch that allows more charter schools without addressing increases in reimbursements to traditional public schools that some lawmakers and advocates have demanded .Peisch said the new bill contains many of elements that were being considered by the committee , but is silent on reimbursement funding .The bill contains increased flexibility for certain underperforming school districts and a \" modest \" enrollment cap increase for charter schools in the lowest performing districts .The House vote effectively moves the issue out of the Education Committee , which was unable to agree on a bill after months of talks and in the face of a biennial reporting deadline .The Peisch bill is now being considered by the House Ways and Means Committee .Peisch informed Sen. Sonia Chang - Diaz , the Senate Education Committee co - chair , that she was filing her own version of the bill , known as act to improve student achievement .\" The subject matter of this bill , I think was too important , to die by using procedural rules and not allowing the bill to advance so there could be a full debate in the Legislature , \" Peisch told the News Service Wednesday .Over the weekend Chang - Diaz and Rep. Russell Holmes ( D - Boston ) offered a plan that would have tied annual increases in the cap to full reimbursement to local school districts that lose students to charter schools .Peisch and the Race to the Top Coalition , a group that has pushed for charter school expansion , opposed linking the enrollment cap to reimbursement , an idea Chang - Diaz promoted as a compromise .Peisch said her plan could enable the issue to reach the floors of the House and Senate .\" This does give an opportunity for the bill to be taken up in the Senate if and when it goes through the House , \" she said .Speaker DeLeo has said he was hopeful for action on the issue this session .After the committee was unable to reach a compromise in time to meet the Tuesday evening deadline , Chang - Diaz released a statement saying she was \" sad that obstinacy and polarized rhetoric stood in the way of compromise and progress . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.44818"}

Mindy Greiling ( D - Roseville ) , a proponent of the sex - ed bill .The pending legislation mandates that local school districts arm students with information about how to prevent pregnancies and STDs .It directs officials to use an \" abstinence first \" approach , though exact details would be left to the school districts .\" They can choose to implement this in any way they choose , \" says Lorie Alveshere , policy director for the Minnesota Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention and Parenting .\" It just creates the outline from which they would then work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.4673"}

Cushing , the prime sponsor , also used a little - known legislative rule to gather official sponsorship of an additional 104 Representatives .At the January 16 public hearing , committee members heard from Phil McLaughlin and Greg Smith , both of whom who had supported the death penalty during their terms as NH Attorneys General .\" Through most of my life I favored capital punishment and the death penalty , \" McLaughlin testified .Noting that the last execution in New Hampshire was in 1939 , he said that it would be at least 75 years and 1000 murders before the State conducts another execution .\" It will not be seen as fair by history , \" he observed .Other speakers included former judges , former law enforcement and corrections officers , the two bishops and other faith leaders , several murder victim family members , and legislators from both political parties .When the hearing was done , 31 people had testified in favor of HB 1170 compared to only 3 who spoke in opposition .The committee followed up the hearing with its own debate on February 11 .There , veteran Representatives Steve Shurtleff , Laura Pantelakos , Robbie Parsons , and Dennis Fields announced they had changed their views and would vote for repeal .When the speeches were done the committee voted 11 to 3 to support the repeal bill , with a majority of both Democrats and Republican members aligned against the death penalty and with no one willing to write a minority opinion .With such strong , bi - partisan support from the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee expectations were high for the House vote on March 12 .But it would have been hard to predict that Representatives would vote 225 to 104 , more than a 2-to-1 margin , to send the repeal bill on to the Senate .Coalition leaders always saw the Senate as a tougher arena .Again repeal supporters showed up in large numbers for an April 3 public hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , and once again the hearing had to be moved to Representatives Hall .Pro - repeal speakers were joined by two prominent retired judges , John Broderick , former Chief Justice of the NH Supreme Court , and Walter Murphy , former Chief Justice of the NH Superior Court .\" There is simply no valid reason for a civilized society to condone the systematic killing human beings , \" Justice Broderick wrote in a NH Union Leader op - ed co - authored by Joseph Nadeau , another retired Supreme Court Justice .But in contrast to the House hearing , Senator Sharon Carson , Chair of the Judiciary Committee , pushed back with questions about the impact of repeal on the case of Michael Addison .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.537315"}

{"text": "However being the only barrier method of contraception for males they often have to put up with them for sensible reasons .I have always been aware of femidoms but never really paid much attention to them as they are n't particularly well advertised and are not stocked in shops anywhere near as much as male condoms are .After a day of fabulous sex I became fed up with the dramatic \" YUCK \" noise that my boyfriend was making every time he had to put a condom on or take it off .I suggested we tried female condoms instead .So intrigued by the idea we went to the large Boots store in Brighton which appears to be one of the few places that sells them and brought a pack of three which costs \u00a3 4.79 .So at around \u00a3 1.60 per femidom these work out pretty expensive compared to the male latex condoms .They can also be purchased in some chemists but are probably easier to get hold of online .The femidoms themselves come in individually wrapped sachets .They are made of polyurethane which is thinner and feels different to latex .It does mean that they are suitable for those allergic to or uncomfortable with latex condoms .When we opened the packet we were quite shocked as it vaguely resembles a long sandwich bag and looks very unappealing ! !They are 6.5 inches long and have a sealed end and a wider open end .Inside the sealed end is a flexible ring which is what holds the femidom open inside of you and is used to aid insertion .The femidom 's are lubricated and are see - though in appearance .Instructions for insertion imply that it is a fairly simple process !You need to pinch the ring in the sealed end together so that it looks like a figure of eight .You then hold it tight and push it as far up inside you as you can .As you let go , the ring springs open to hold the femidom open inside of you .The open end of the femidom remains outside of your body and the male needs to ensure that during penetration he goes in this outer ring .The best positions for insertion are either laying on your back , standing with one leg raised on a chair or squatting down ( both highly unromantic ! )My first issue was with the appearance of the femidom as it made me think of a tesco 's carrier bag ! !It does not look at all appealing but I suppose it does n't really need to .Insertion is a bit of a nightmare .Firstly because it is a very undignified process , secondly because the ring which you need to pinch together in a figure of 8 to insert it is covered in lubricant and slips out of your fingers !It is really hard to pinch it together properly and once you do , you then need to do various forms of gymnastics in order to insert the thing ! !Technically you could get your bloke to insert it for you but this really does n't do a lot for the romantic mood !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.08126"}

{"text": "Senate Bill 202 , a bill to adjust language in the burglary statute , passed the Senate without controversy in March and was referred to the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee where it sat until early May.By then , the story of Clayton Lockett , who died of a heart attack 45 minutes after the State of Oklahoma tried to kill him with lethal chemicals , was all over the news and once again giving lawmakers something new to think about .Representatives Cushing and John Cebrowski agreed legislators should get another look at the issue .When the Criminal Justice Committee finally gave SB 202 its attention , Rep. Cushing came in with an amendment tagging a simple death penalty repeal provision onto the burglary bill .As before , the committee gave repeal its strong endorsement setting up another vote in the full House .This time the outcome was 218 to 117 on the first vote , adopting the repeal amendment , followed by a 226 to 110 vote in favor of the amended bill .Once again , the House had called for an end to the death penalty by a more than 2-to-1 margin and included 53 Republicans voting with the majority .The strong endorsement from the House did not , however , sway any votes on the Senate side .When SB 202 returned to the upper chamber , they quickly defeated it by voice vote following a short anti - death penalty speech from Senator David Pierce and a pro - death penalty statement by Senator Jeb Bradley .Moreover Senator Odell , who had belatedly given his support to the repeal measure during the April 17 Senate debate , expressed his unhappiness that the issue had been revived by the House and indicated he would not vote again in support .As New Hampshire politics shifts attention from legislation to elections , the question remains whether the state has really experienced a \" seismic shift \" on the death penalty or if it could swing backwards .One thing is clear : the NH Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty and its allies are not going away .Repeal passed both the House and Senate in 2000 only to be vetoed by then - Governor Jeanne Shaheen .The House adopted a repeal bill again in 2009 by a vote of 193 to 174 only to have it tabled in the Senate .With calls for repeal growing louder and more organized , repeal is certain to stay on the agenda until its supporters are successful .As the Concord Monitor has editorialized , repeal is \" inevitable .\" It 's not a question of whether New Hampshire will give up its authority to carry out executions but when .Arnie Alpert is NH Director of the American Friends Service Committee .He has been active with the NH Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty since its formation in 1997 .Bayard Rustin , Activist .Subscribe to our Newsletter .American Friends Service Committee .Who we are .AFSC is a Quaker organization devoted to service , development , and peace programs throughout the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.00981"}

Rick Perry , who supports the legislation .Senate Bill 83 , by Sen. Jeff Wentworth , R - San Antonio , passed the Senate last month .The House sponsor , Rep. Dan Branch , R - Dallas , said the bill would require recitation of pledges to both the U.S. and Texas flags , and a moment of silence to pray , meditate or reflect at the beginning of each school day .The legislation would replace the current Texas law , which gives school districts the option of holding a period of silence and reciting the pledge .There was little debate on the bill , which had 90 co - authors in the House and passed on a voice vote .Unless their parents submitted a written objection , students , regardless of citizenship status , would be required to participate in the pledges and moment of silence .However , the bill provides no penalties for students who fail to do so .Opponents say the bill would take away First Amendment rights from schoolchildren who may want to excuse themselves from the pledges or minute of silence .But supporters argue that the bill has the opt - out provision .Branch said the bill would have a positive impact on the state 's more than 4 million schoolchildren by emphasizing patriotism .\" This freedom is symbolized in this minute of silence where our children , with the encouragement of their parents , can focus on whatever they deem important as they start the school day , \" Branch said .Wentworth has said it is important for students to show respect by reciting the pledges .\" I believe it is a citizen 's responsibility , especially in the greatest nation on Earth ... that we train our young students to be loyal to our country , \" Wentworth said .The Houston Independent School District and most Houston - area districts direct principals to determine whether their students recite the pledges and observe a minute of silence .Rep.

{"text": "And what New Hampshire ( Department of Justice ) would like to do is enact a radical change of that provision and say , no , we 're going to have to wait until someone is on the brink of disaster to go to court .But again , what a woman needs when she 's on the brink of disaster is not to go to the courthouse , but to go to the emergency room in a hospital .Leaving young women whose medical conditions are so urgent to have to wait to file a court as - applied challenge gives them no recourse to the possibility of getting effective relief and being able to exercise their constitutional rights .The Supreme Court has never required , nor should it , that women be on the brink of disaster before blocking an unconstitutional law .And so , we are hopeful that the court , in looking at its precedence , and in respecting its core commitment to women 's health , will stick by its core commitments to the constitutional law and the protection of women 's health and lives .MR .MASCI :Thank you , Nancy .WILLIAM SAUNDERS : Let me read you some provisions from the law that is under challenge in this case .Section one : No abortions shall be performed upon an unemancipated minor until at least 48 hours after written notice of the pending abortion has been delivered to the parent at the usual place of abode .Why the parent ?Because this is an unemancipated minor , which means the minor is living with at least one parent .There are some exceptions for delivery if you can not make it , but generally it provides for delivery , and then a 48-hour wait after the parents have been notified .Now , if we stop right there , I think that most people would find that to be a reasonable statute on its face .An unemancipated minor , a girl who has not come of age , who is living with her parent ( at least one parent ) the parents have to be notified and the abortion can not be performed for 48 hours after that notice .Even so , the statute goes on to provide exceptions .One exception is that if the abortion provider certifies in the minor 's record that abortion is necessary to prevent the minor 's death , then you do not need to make notice .The statute goes further .The statute expressly provides that the courts are open for this purpose 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and if the judge issues an order that authorizes an abortion , it is not subject to appeal .That is the statute .Here is the person who is covered by the statute .These statements that I 'm going to make come out of the brief - the amicus brief we filed in the case .You can check the sources for yourself .First - and I 'll call the girl Jane - she 's close to her 16th birthday .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.91469"}

{"text": "Although the female condom is made of polyurethane plastic ( not latex ) , it requires no special storage .It can be inserted quite a while before having sex , it does not require immediate withdrawal after ejaculation and it can be used with both oil - based and water - based lubricants .Because the external ring is usually visible during sex , a woman can not easily use a female condom without her partner knowing about it , but women do have more control over use of this method than they do over the use of a male condom .Because it can be inserted hours before sexual intercourse , it can provide protection in situations where consumption of alcohol or drugs may reduce the chances that a male condom will be used .The female condom also provides protection during menstruation .The female condom provides extra protection to men and woman because it covers both the entrance to the vagina and the base of the penis , both of which are areas where STD sores make it easy for HIV to enter .How to use the female condom The following instructions should be presented on how to insert the female condom : .Before using the female condom , rub it between your fingers in order to spread the lubrication evenly around .Twist the inner ring into a figure-8 shape and hold between your fingers , or just squeeze the inner ring .The vagina must be relaxed when you insert the condom .Squat or sit with your knees apart , or stand with one leg raised .Push the inner ring into your vagina with your fingers ( use the same insertion method you use to insert a tampon ) , and be careful to ensure that your fingernails or jewellery do not damage the polyurethane .Put your index finger in the condom and gently push the inner ring up into the vagina as far as it will go .The condom should fit snugly against the cervix ( behind the pubic bone ) .It is in the right place if you do n't feel it .The outer ring should hang outside the vagina , and it should not be twisted .During intercourse it is necessary to guide the penis into the condom and to check that the penis has not entered the vagina outside the condom wall .Make sure that the condom is not pushed into the vagina by the penis .If there is a problem ( e.g. if the condom rips or tears , if the outer ring is pushed inside or if the condom bundles up inside the vagina ) , remove the condom and insert a new one .Do n't ever use a male condom at the same time as the female condom because the friction between them will move both condoms out of their proper positions .Remove the condom after male ejaculation by squeezing and twisting the outer ring and gently pulling the condom out of the vagina .Remove the condom before standing up .Wrap the condom in tissue paper and dispose of it in a rubbish bin and not in the toilet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.38757"}

{"text": "While these data were self - reported , they do point to an overarching trend , one in which people falsely believe that oral sex will protect them from acquiring STDs .HIV , however , can indeed be transmitted orally , as the virus can be found in blood , vaginal fluids , seminal fluids , and pre - ejaculate .According to the researchers at the University of Maryland , .Cells in the mucous lining of the mouth may carry HIV into the lymph nodes or the bloodstream .Also , blood from the mouth may enter the urethra , the vagina , the anus , or directly into the body through small cuts or open sores .Researchers have found that the majority of sexually active adolescents do n't use barrier methods , such as condoms , for oral sex .STDs , however , can be transmitted orally .One study carried out by researchers at Yale University found that 70 percent of adolescents who reported engaging in oral sex had never used a barrier to protect themselves from STDs during oral sex - and only 17 percent reported using barriers every time .The same study found that only 9 percent never used protection during vaginal intercourse , and 61 percent reported using protection every time .These lopsided data indicate that there seems to be a prevailing view among young people that oral sex is low - risk or even risk - free , though they still recognize the importance of using barrier methods for vaginal intercourse .This study found no difference in STD rates among pledgers versus nonpledgers , and this may be due to pledgers ' propensity toward unprotected oral sex as well as a greater reluctance to use barrier methods even after starting to engage in vaginal intercourse .Pledgers were also found to be less likely to be screened for STDs .It is possible that many adolescents have been conditioned to think of oral sex as not \" real \" sex .Especially within a heterosexual context , sexually active people might be more likely to regard vaginal intercourse as \" real \" sex , with other activities ranking lower .Additionally , abstinence - only - until - marriage programs , intentionally or not , seem to be correlated with the idea among students that one 's virginity can be \" preserved \" by having oral or anal sex in lieu of vaginal intercourse .Because these programs are not likely to provide students with accurate information about barrier methods , those who engage in oral or anal sex to preserve their virginity are less likely to use condoms or dental dams .These attitudes - that oral sex is not \" real \" sex and is therefore less risky , along with ignorance regarding STD transmission and methods of prevention - give rise to higher STD transmission rates among the sexually active population .It is important that sexually active people are able to know and evaluate the risks inherent to sexual activity , but when the belief that oral sex is \" low - risk \" persists , they can not make decisions based on accurate information .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.48685"}

{"text": "Furthermore , homeschooling also offers the child a more limited , yet at the same time a more expanded pool of behaviors to observe .Since the child 's \" class \" is his family , he is ( ideally ) not exposed to as many of the undesirable behaviors he might have observed in a public school classroom and is therefore not given as much opportunity to emulate those undesirable behaviors .Alternatively , a homeschooled child is often introduced to a wide range of behaviors through field trips , homeschool support groups , and other outside activities .This interaction with adults and children both older and younger than himself which gives him the opportunity to observe and interact with a wide variety of people , not just children his own age as occurs in a public school classroom setting .While this may mean he is sometimes exposed to behaviors that are undesirable , the parents are often available to offer immediate feedback and to discuss the situation .As a minor example , my own children participated in a homeschool group this last year , and it happened every week that the younger kids ( 5 - 10 ) were playing with the older kids ( 10 - 14 ) and interacting just fine .There were n't any stigmas that the older kids could n't associate with the younger kids as often exist in public school .In my opinion , that 's a perfect example of well - socialized behavior .So although a child can learn socialization in a public school setting , I believe proper socialization skills can be learned more easily in a homeschool setting .Great post - especially about the part that homeschooled children get opportunities involving socialization that public school kids just do n't have .Since core lessons do n't typically take 6 hours to teach ( like public schools ) , the student has even MORE time to interact with community groups , non - profit organizations , or whatever worthy social interests the student wants to pursue .This gives the student opportunities to really build some notable accomplishments that would be tougher to achieve in a public school environment ( You can just imagine this exchange from a public school student talking on the phone with her favorite charity , \" What ?A once - in - a - life - time series of charity events that starts at 10AM and lasts for the next 4 days ?Sorry , but I do n't get out of school until 2:30PM \" .Bummer ) .Well stated .I whole - heartedly agree that homeschoolers need not get \" stumped \" by this question .As you articulately pointed out , it all comes back to truly understanding what socialization is and is n't .Not to knock public - schooled kids , because I know some who are true gems , but I marvel at how society - at - large can cry \" socialization ! \"and then wring their hands at the prevailing mediocrity making its way from the campus to the workforce .Too often , children in a public school setting are n't learning the kind of socialization that will allow them to become productive adults , but the kind that gets them invited into the right clique .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.525314"}

Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) has emphasized this point , arguing that \" [ J]ust because some in Congress may prefer the policies of one State over those in Vermont , does not mean we should give those policies federal enforcement authority across the nation . \"As an example , Leahy pointed out that Vermont allows the carrying of concealed weapons without a permit , while Massachusetts ' law bars that practice .\" When Vermonters travel to neighboring states and across the nation , we understand that we must conform our behavior to the laws of the States we visit .When residents of each State may carry with them only the laws of their own State , they may be advantaged or disadvantaged but one thing is clear : We will have turned our federal system on its ear . \"Looking Ahead .The overwhelming margin by which the House endorsed the CCPA - the vote was 276 - 159-amply demonstrates the extent to which abortion foes have mainstream appeal going for them on this issue .In their strategic calculations , bill proponents probably also did not overlook the fact that President Clinton signed a mandatory parental notice law while governor of Arkansas .As with the pending ban on \" partial - birth \" abortion , which the president also has said he would sign if it were modified only slightly to include an exception to protect the woman 's health , antiabortion leaders are unlikely to take up the president 's challenge .Apparently they have made the political calculation that , new law or not , they have a winning horse to ride into the fall campaigns .Rights and Obligations of Parents .Historically , philosophers have had relatively little to say about the family .This is somewhat surprising , given the pervasive presence and influence of the family upon both individuals and social life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.65279"}

{"text": "Good morning , and thank you all for coming today .My name is David Masci and I 'm a senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life .I 'm not sure whether you had trouble with the name Ayotte , but I certainly did , in pronouncing it .I actually called the office of Attorney General Kelly Ayotte , obviously one of the parties in the case , and was told to think of a large pleasure boat , a yacht - which was actually very helpful because I was calling her a variety of other things .I 'd like to talk a little about the issues at hand in the case .But before I do that , let me just take a minute to tell you about the three groups that are sponsoring today 's discussion .The Pew Forum , the organization I work for , is part of the Pew Research Center , which is a nonpartisan fact tank that provides information on issues , attitudes and trends shaping America and the world .As for the Pew Forum , its mission is to provide timely information on important issues at the intersection of religion and public affairs .We are nonpartisan in nature , and that means we do not take positions on any topics , including the ones we are going to be discussing today .The Federalist Society is a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in law and public policy .It is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom and that it is the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is , not what it should be .The society seeks to promote an awareness of these principles and to further them through its activities .The American Constitution Society is one of the nation 's leading progressive legal organizations .While I 'm on the subject of our partners , I 'd like to thank Dean Reuter and David Ray of the Federalist Society , and Bill Yeomans of the American Constitution Society for their outstanding efforts and hard work in helping us to organize this event .Today we are here to talk about the Ayotte case , which will be argued before the Supreme Court tomorrow .Ayotte is significant in part because it is the first abortion case the Supreme Court has taken up in five years , and the first such case that the new chief justice , John Roberts , will hear .It is also the last abortion case Sandra Day O'Connor is likely to hear , and if it is re - argued , which is entirely possible , it could also be the first case to come before her replacement .Ayotte involves a challenge by a number of abortion providers to a New Hampshire parental notification law , which requires that a parent or guardian be notified at least 48 hours before a minor obtains an abortion .The challenge hinges in part on the fact that the law does not include a so - called \" health exception , \" an explicit waiver to the notification requirement that would allow an abortion to be performed to protect the health of the minor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.77587"}

Patricia Jehlen , a Somerville Democrat , said the proposed charter cap lift in the bill would not occur until the fall of 2017 , negating any argument for pushing legislation through before the end of the month since it would not take effect for years .Others like Sen. Kenneth Donnelly , of Arlington , and Sen. Jason Lewis , of Winchester , suggested more care must be taken to study why best practices in charter schools are n't being replicated more often in traditional district schools .Jehlen said the money proposed for expanding charters would be better put towards early education , and several senators expressed concern that they could n't see the \" end game \" and worried about creating two competing public school systems .While much of the focus of the debate was on charter schools , the bills also included measures to help struggling schools on the brink of being labeled \" underperforming \" develop turnaround plans to avoid more serious state interventions .Rep. Alice Peisch , the House Education Committee chairwoman , said she was disappointed by the vote .While Peisch said she intended to review the \" very limited options \" for resurrecting the so - called \" challenge school \" sections of the bill , Chang - Diaz said she was dubious about its prospects for passage so late in the session , which ends on July 31 .\" Very little is impossible in the Legislature but I would n't handicap it as likely , which is why I think this was a real lost opportunity today , \" Chang - Diaz said .Murray said she thought the school turnaround initiatives would have a \" very good chance \" of passing on their own , and encouraged Peisch and Chang - Diaz to talk .\" I think if they had been more unified or there had been more unification on the committee maybe things would have gone easier , \" she said .Chang - Diaz said she did n't feel as though she had been abandoned by members of Senate leadership , who allowed the bill to advance only to vote against it on the floor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.62227"}

{"text": "For example , while laws and policies in 23 states specified that all sexuality education must include instruction about abstinence , only 13 states required such courses to cover contraceptive methods .11 Furthermore , only 22 states required that courses on HIV and STD prevention provide information on condom use and other prevention strategies in addition to information about abstinence .12 A large majority of states have developed curricula or guidelines to provide program guidance to local school districts in implementing sexuality education programs .Many of these guides exclude such topics as abortion , homosexuality and masturbation because they are considered too controversial .School districts appear to be more likely than states to require instruction about contraception and STD prevention .In a 1994 survey , for example , the CDC found that more than 80 % of school districts required instruction about the prevention of HIV and other STDs as part of health education , and that 72 % required instruction about pregnancy prevention in their health programs .15 Most students , however , do not receive any instruction until ninth or 10th grade , 16 by which time many have already become sexually active .Even then , the information they receive may be insufficient .\" It is widely believed by professionals in the field that most programs are short , are not comprehensive , fail to cover important topics and are less effective than they could be , \" Douglas Kirby observed .Regardless of whether a state mandates sex education or AIDS education , there is no guarantee that the subject will be taught in all school districts , because many states do not have a mechanism for monitoring program implementation .In fact , there is often wide variation in what is taught , both within school districts and even within the same school .A NEW STRATEGY .Since the early 1990s , sex education advocates report , opponents have brought increasing pressure to bear on school officials and teachers as they have refocused their efforts on local school boards and state legislatures .Prior to that time , opponents had concentrated primarily on national politics .\" They realized that who is in the principal 's office matters more than who is in the Oval Office , \" observes Leslie Kantor .\" They decided to pay attention to elections no one pays attention to , like those for school board and county commissioner . \" As a result of this shift , recent years have seen a sharp rise in the number of challenges to individual school district policies .According to SIECUS , more than 500 local disputes over sexuality education occurred in all 50 states between 1992 and 1997 .19 In contrast , SIECUS documented a total of six local controversies in 1990 .The substance of the debate over sexuality education has also changed , largely in response to the need to combat AIDS .\" The controversy has shifted from whether to offer sex education in schools to what should be taught in these classes , \" observes Susan Wilson , executive coordinator of the Network for Family Life Education in New Jersey .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.12421"}

Patricia Jehlen , a Somerville Democrat , said the proposed charter cap lift in the bill would not occur until the fall of 2017 , negating any argument for pushing legislation through before the end of the month since it would not take effect for years .Others like Sen.

{"text": "Proposal to end charter deadlock on Beacon Hill raises doubts .Share via e - mail .State Senator Sonia Chang - Diaz offered a proposal Saturday to break a deadlock on Beacon Hill that could allow more charter schools to open in Boston and other cities .But charter school advocates immediately dismissed the proposal , describing it as nothing more than a veiled attempt to block the expansion of charter schools .They had previously criticized Chang - Diaz , a Boston Democrat who is cochair of the Legislature 's Joint Education Committee , for allegedly blocking legislation that would have allowed for more schools to open .Saturday 's proposal from Chang - Diaz came with a hitch : In order for more charter schools to open in a given year , the Legislature would have to reimburse local districts for some of the state aid they lose when students in their communities enroll in charter schools .Chang - Diaz touted the proposal as a reasonable compromise .In a statement Saturday she said the deal was hashed out with the lead sponsor of the charter school bill , Representative Russell Holmes , a Boston Democrat .Chang - Diaz has repeatedly raised concerns about the financial implications on local districts of opening more charter schools .\" The question is , how can we give more room for good operating charter schools to expand without in any way penalizing or disproportionately pulling resources away from children in the district system , \" she said in an interview .But by midafternoon , Chang - Diaz faced a fresh round of criticism from charter school proponents .The Race to the Top Coalition , a group of business , education , and civic leaders , said the proposal would enable the Legislature each year to halt charter school expansion simply by underfunding the reimbursements to local districts .The deal between Chang - Diaz and Holmes comes just three days before the Legislature 's education committee is scheduled to decide whether to support allowing more charter schools in Boston and other cities .Chang - Diaz 's cochair , Representative Alice Peisch , a Wellesley Democrat , also expressed skepticism about the proposal .Peisch said she had many questions and that the Race to the Top Coalition raised a legitimate concern .\" At this point in time , I do n't support it , \" Peisch said .\" I appreciate there is an effort to address the impact of expansion on district budgets , but I remain unpersuaded that this is the way to go . \" The bill under consideration includes another concession for local districts in exchange for allowing more charters to open that has broad support .Districts would gain greater flexibility to extend school days , shake up teaching and administrative staffs , and make other changes at schools on the cusp of being declared \" underperforming \" by the state because of persistently low state standardized test scores .Funding of charter schools has long been controversial in Massachusetts .Under state law , every time a student enrolls in a charter school , thousands of dollars in state aid is diverted from his or her hometown district to cover the educational costs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.040695"}

{"text": "Whether the pressure to avoid controversial subjects is real or imagined is a matter of debate .Nevertheless , the perception among teachers is that this pressure not only exists but has also intensified in recent years .\" Teachers perceive themselves as more constrained , \" reports Patti Caldwell , senior vice president of Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona , which provides sex education in public schools in the Tucson area .\" There is limited evidence that they are as constrained as they think they are , but the perception has a significant impact on their confidence . \" Fueling this perception , Caldwell and others say , is teachers ' sense that they do not have the support of their principal and superintendent .\" Administrators ' commitment and comfort with the field is more important than board policy or official doctrine , \" observes Scott McCann , vice president for education at Planned Parenthood of Santa Barbara , Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties in California .Fear of controversy deters many school officials from taking a high - profile position on sex education , proponents say .A LACK OF TRAINING .Teachers and others believe that educators ' wariness of sex education is often exacerbated by a lack of training , which leaves many feeling unprepared to teach the subject .The problems stem from both inadequate instruction during the teachers ' undergraduate preparation and from a dearth of staff development and training opportunities once they are in the classroom .Although undergraduate programs for aspiring teachers generally have at least one course on sexuality education or health education , many of these schools do not require prospective teachers to take such a course .In a 1995 survey of college - based teacher certification programs , for example , fewer than two - thirds required candidates seeking certification in health education to take a course on sexuality , 36 even though sexuality education is most commonly provided by health education teachers . 37According to the same survey , none of the programs required prospective teachers to take a course on HIV and AIDS prevention .Furthermore , very few programs require a course in how to teach these subjects : For example , only 9 % of health education certification programs require students to take a course in sexuality education methodology , and none requires a course on HIV and AIDS education methods .Thus , many new teachers assume the responsibility of sexuality education with neither in - depth knowledge of the subject matter nor adequate instruction in how to teach it .The states share the blame for this problem , because few require that teachers of sexuality education or HIV and AIDS education teachers be certified in a relevant subject , such as health education .Moreover , only six states require training for sexuality educators before they begin teaching , and only nine states and the District of Columbia require such training for teachers of HIV and AIDS education .Once in the classroom , teachers often have little opportunity or incentive to enhance their skills and knowledge . \"Years ago , schools encouraged you to go to workshops , \" recalls McCaffree . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.94356"}
{"text": "As a parent , of course , I too would very much want my teenage daughter to come and talk to me if she were pregnant and if she were considering an abortion .I certainly would want to be part of that conversation about her medical history .But the reason that we have , in these statutes , the exceptions that allow minors to go to court , is that all families are not always ones in which minors can talk to their parents .There may be abuse within the family .There may be issues about violence .There may be issues about sexual abuse .To have every minor have to notify their parent is not a circumstance that can be good .I would want that doctor and my daughter to go forward rather than have them wait and have her health be damaged .MR .MASCI :Bill , would you like to take a crack at that or should we move on ?MR .SAUNDERS :The only thing that I would say is that with any other medical condition , even if the girl wants it , you 've got to get parental consent .In New Jersey , if it 's an emergency you can proceed .There are statutory provisions for emergency medical procedures , which would apply here too , I would think .I do not think we want to treat the pregnancy differently than we do all other medical conditions , all other health conditions , all other situations the underage girl finds herself in .I note that Mr. Saunders did n't make that argument , did n't make that note , and so I wonder whether you agree with it , and if so , on what basis ?And I would like to find out whether Ms. Northup agrees with it or disputes that prediction and on what basis .MR .SAUNDERS :Well , the health exception as such in the federal courts is very broad and covers any familial , psychological and other issues .She can waive the notification .So it would just add a huge loophole in a statute that already is very broad because of health exception being so widely defined to include any condition .It is not just physical but psychological , familial , et cetera .MS .NORTHUP : I think you are right about the history in New Hampshire to the extent that there was opposition to it .But I 'm not so sure it was only about the loophole , but that they also actually wanted to test and try to cut back on the constitutional laws and protections .I think what is important to note is that this excuse is always used - that health exceptions are broad and that they lead to doctors okaying everything .A couple of things here : One , the plaintiffs in New Hampshire are not talking about some generic health exception ; they 're talking about a medical emergency exception .The doctor has to say that this is a condition which requires immediate abortion or there will be some kind of permanent health damage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.97768"}

{"text": "At the same time , hundreds of parents of Boston school children pressed lawmakers to leave the cap intact , circulating an online petition that has so far netted 2,700 signatures .At a State House press conference , Holmes , Chang Diaz and other supporters of the the Holmes / Chang Diaz bill stressed the importance of securing adequate funding for both charter schools and conventional public schools .The current funding system pits charters against the other schools in the districts in which they operate , noted Mariama White Hammond , who has nieces in charter and public schools .\" This bill says , ' let 's put charter and regular schools in the same boat so we can row together , ' \" she said .Charter schools receive public funding from the school districts in which they operate , but are not subject to direct control from the districts .Charter schools do not operate under union contracts , so principals are free to hire , fire and set personnel policies .Students are admitted to charter schools by lottery .When a student enters a charter school , the local school department is required to pay the charter at a rate commensurate with the district 's per - pupil spending .While state law requires that the Commonwealth reimburse the district fully for the first year , then at 25 percent for the next three years , the state has never met that obligation .Speaking in support of the compromise legislation , state Sen. Linda Dorcena Forry said she would like to see adequate funding for all 56,000 children in Boston 's public school system .\" We want to make sure that the funding is there to support all the schools , \" she said .Response to the Holmes / Chang Diaz amendment was swift .Members of a coalition of charter school supporters were on hand to denounce the measure during the press conference .Candace Barker , whose daughter attends the Brooke charter school in Mattapan , said the school was the only well - performing school she had access to .\" I did n't like the options I had as walk - to schools , \" she said .\" I wanted to increase the odds I could get a quality school for my daughter .I feel what my daughter has , everyone should have access to . \"The district school supporters , who were not in the State House in force last week , said the funds new charters would take from the school system would lead to more cuts .\" They 're cutting everything , \" said Sara Barcan , who has two children in district schools .\" They 're cutting physical activities , supplies .You have schools running out of copy paper in March .This is not the time to lift the cap on charter schools .\" In the end , Education Committee Chairwoman Alice Peisch pulled the plug on the Holmes/ Chang Diaz compromise , advancing a bill that would allow for charter school expansion without tying the expansion to state reimbursements .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.359924"}

{"text": "\" They do n't identify themselves as sex education teachers .\" Most sex education teachers are physical education instructors , school nurses or health , biology or home economics teachers 43 who , according to several of the people interviewed for this report , may wish to avoid jeopardizing their careers for something they may consider a secondary responsibility .Lack of ease with the subject matter is another obstacle .The paucity of training and in - service opportunities means that some teachers have not had an opportunity to resolve their own tensions and anxieties about the issues they are expected to discuss with students .\" Teachers have personal discomfort with some topics , \" notes Leslie Kantor .\" They need both the nuts and bolts as well as a chance to work through their own feelings .It sounds touchy - feely , but it is different getting up in front of a class and talking about oral sex than it is talking about algebra . \"Furthermore , many teachers have not learned techniques that have proven to be most effective in helping teenagers postpone the initiation of sexual activity and use contraception when they do have sex .As Kantor points out , research shows that \" interactive , experiential techniques , such as small - group discussions , role - play exercises and brainstorming rather than didactic approaches make a difference .This is a very important shift in the field , but - there is no training for public school teachers in how to use these more sophisticated teaching techniques , and no opportunity for them to become comfortable with more student - centered learning . \"Instead , Kantor and others say , teachers continue to rely primarily on lectures . \" Reducing a program to lectures , worksheets and purchasable programs is safer than discussion , \" notes Burger , \" because the teacher does n't risk having the students ask the wrong questions . \"ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS .Sex education proponents point to several steps that would address concerns about teacher preparedness and perceptions of lack of community support .Undergraduate institutions should require prospective teachers in certain disciplines , such as health education , to take both subject - matter and methodology courses on sexuality and STD and HIV education , say sex education advocates .In addition , they say , all states should have or adopt certification requirements for teachers of sex education and HIV and STD education .States should also require that school districts do more to facilitate staff development .Proponents of comprehensive sex education suggest that communities create local advisory committees composed of parents , religious leaders , medical professionals and other community leaders to review and approve curricula , books and other materials being proposed for use in a sexuality education course .Some states already require that such a committee be established . \"An advisory committee builds support for the program , \" explains Patricia Nichols , supervisor of the school health program in the Michigan Department of Health .Nichols and others point out that while committee members may not agree on every issue , once they reach a decision the committees generally stand behind it , even when challenged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.429146"}

Minnesota in which there was no health exception in the parental notification statute , and it did n't strike down the statute for that reason .Stenberg v.

{"text": "But , as the Supreme Court said in Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the court and the states do have an interest in unborn human life .So , in the context of a minor , of a girl underage , is a health exception necessary ?Again , there is nothing in Stenberg that requires it .Planned Parenthood v. Casey seems to indicate that it should not be required .And we have to keep in mind this fundamental distinction between an emancipated minor or woman who has attained her majority , and an underage girl .We notice the laws always treat a minor girl differently than an emancipated minor or woman .She can not go on school trips without a parent 's written consent .She can not take aspirin without her parent 's consent .She can not get a tattoo without her parent 's consent .She is prevented under law from marrying the person who got her pregnant without her parent 's consent .She ca n't put the child up for adoption without her parent 's consent .She ca n't have any kind of surgery at all without her parent 's consent .Why in the world would we call out an exception here in the context of abortion ?This case is not about the right to abortion .Is she going to make that decision without her parent 's involvement ?We do not treat minor girls like women .Their decision - making is not as good .That is why we have a difference between minors and majors in the law .We 've made a distinction that , at certain ages , your decision - making is not as good .And think about the abortion context again for this girl .She 's become pregnant by an older man almost always .She does not live by herself .She 's not married .She has nobody really to talk to about this , and her parents are being walled off until the outcome , which is being set up to wall her parents off during maybe the most difficult period of her entire life .So I think that the Supreme Court will find the New Hampshire statute to be constitutional .There is the question of standard of review , which was mentioned .There are two different cases .There is a Salerno case , which says if you are going to make a facial challenge to a statute , you have to show that in no circumstances would it survive constitutional scrutiny .Or does Planned Parenthood v. Casey establish a new standard or a different standard ?I would say , if Planned Parenthood v. Casey 's undue burden standard changes the overall standard for a facial challenge to a statute , it changes it only in the context of the spousal consent provision that was at issue in Planned Parenthood v. Casey .So I do n't think a facial challenge before the statute has been applied is appropriate here , nor do I think the Supreme Court will find it to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.73226"}

{"text": "At either end of the femidom there is a flexible polyurethane ring ( as illustrated in the picture ) .How To Use .As with an ordinary condom , open the package carefully , being careful not to tear it with teeth , nails or jewellery .Find a position that is comfortable for insertion , maybe you could squat , lie down , or sit on a chair with legs apart .Tampon users may find the femidom easier to insert due to experience of using internal products .Basically you squeeze the ring at the closed end between finger and thumb until it becomes long and narrow , and then gently insert it into the vagina , lacing it as far up as it will go without being uncomfortable .You need to use your finger to make sure the condom is not twisted or bunched in any way .The other ring at the open end should be left outside the vaginal entrance , where it performs the duty ( according to the instructions ) of acting as a guide during penetration .I have to state here that I find this amusing .I would hope that whoever I was bedding might have some idea on their own of where to penetrate , or maybe I 've just been lucky with my men .But really what they mean is that you have to guide the penis into the ring to make sure it does n't slip in between the femidom and the vaginal wall .You can insert the condom up to eight hours before intercourse , although if you do this I 'd advise a quick check all is still in place before getting down to business !The condom is lubricated on the inside , although you can use additional lubricant .The lubricant is non - spermicidal ( meaning it does n't kill those tadpoles ) and is silicon based .Normal condom rules apply .Also , the femidom can only be used once , by which I mean for one act of penetrative sex only .Removing the condom is pretty easy , just twist the outer ring , which should still be outside your vagina if used correctly , and then pull the condom out , and throw it away .Femidoms can also be used during anal sex .In my own experience of using the condom , inserting it did take me around five minutes , the first time , mainly due to the fact that I was following the instructions as I went along .Although it took me a while to insert , it was not hard work , just a little unfamiliar .I 've used it twice since , and insertion has been a little easier each time .For me the benefits of the femidom are numerous .I like the fact that because it is made from polyurethane rather than latex I can use it with oil based lubricants , meaning I do n't have to carefully check bottles and tubes before purchase if they are to be used in conjunction with the femidom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.058426"}

{"text": "1 ) become the national leader in fighting Obamacare , and 2 ) refusing to rule out running for governor in 2013 .These two points will have major implications in the 2012 GOP Primary here in Virginia for president .I have no doubt that Mitt Romney will be running for president in 2012 ( again ) .In 2008 , Gov. Romney had no stronger supporter in the commonwealth than Lt .Govenror Bill Bolling .There were no other really definitive endorsements in the state other than Tom Davis for John McCain .Most of the other major Republicans laid low , with Bob McDonnell and George Allen backing Fred Thompson , who sputtered out long before their endorsement mattered .Of all the major Republicans in 2008 , Bolling was most agressive in his support for any of the 2008 GOP candidates .At the time , Romney had positioned himself as the conservative alternative , winning the endorsement of the National Review .But things have changed in the last few years .As Barack Obama pushed Obamacare and its socialistic tendancies towards forced mandates and federal enforcement , eyes turned to Massachusetts where its last Republican governor installed a similar system sans the federal enforcement .But Romneycare is a major shackle on the Romney for President bandwagon , but its doubly - so here in Virginia .Virignia is the epicenter of the anti - Obamacare revolt among states , with AG Cuccinelli captaining the ship .As his signature issue , it puts the health care debate under a super - hot spotlight in Virginia , and will eventually put a spotlight on Bolling 's support of Romney .Now , the bet is that Romney does become the nominee .If that happens , sure Bolling 's early 2008 endorsement will be huge .But if health care drags Romney down , he could be dead weight that drags Bolling down as well as Cuccinelli champions the the demise of government healthcare .As much as I love an open primary , I sincerely dread the thought of a Bolling vs. Cuccinelli primary , even moreso than McDonnell and Bolling last time around .Mostly because I appreciate so much the sacrifice Bolling made in running for reelection - it was that decision that was the catalyst for the GOP renassiance that took place later that year .And while others have made headlines , its been Bill Bolling who has been criss - crossing the commonwealth over the last year working to bring business , keep business , and support business all across the state .His work has n't been headline - grabbing but its been relevant and vastly undereported by both the new and old media .And I still have n't forgotten Bill Bolling the state senator who was the conservative leader in a chamber so riddled with mushy , squishy , fake Republicans .It was Bolling who lead the fight against the Warner tax cuts , comparing them to the end of the Wizard of Oz and what was behind the curtain .But he ca n't beat Ken , and he will never beat him if he has to wear Romney 's colors all over him should Mitt fail in his aspirations ( which I think he will ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.90465"}

{"text": "And the promise of women 's health in the question of the termination of pregnancies has always been at the center of the court 's jurisprudence on abortion .And that has been true for more than three decades .It has been true since Roe v. Wade .The court has required that if there are abortion restrictions that cause delay , or otherwise ban procedures or ban abortion , there must be exceptions for women 's health .In Planned Parenthood v. Casey , at issue was a parental consent law .And the first thing they did was look at the fact that if there was any waiting involved , there was a medical emergency exception .And the court reasoned , and I 'm quoting here from that case , \" ... that the essential holding of Roe forbids a state from interfering with a woman 's choice to undergo an abortion procedure if continuing the pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health .\" If there is a delay , there must be a medical emergency exception .So , applying these longstanding ( three decades ) and constitutional principles , the First Circuit , in looking at New Hampshire law , said it is unconstitutional ; you need that medical emergency exception .New Hampshire and the Bush administration , and other amici who filed briefs in this case , are arguing for a radical change in this core constitutional commitment from Roe v. Wade onward .And this case , therefore , is a prime example .What 's also not at issue tomorrow is , will Roe v. Wade be overturned .But it is a prime example of the way there has been a push - back to chip away at the right to privacy and the right to abortion ever since Planned Parenthood v. Casey .If the court were to agree with the state of New Hampshire and the position of the Bush administration , then we 're not talking about just chipping away at this core value , this constitutional commitment to women 's health .It would be taking an axe to the trunk of the tree of the constitutional protection and cutting it down .The second issue , which we 've also talked about , is this standard of review that the court is also going to be looking at .And as David said , throughout the 30 years of history on abortion jurisprudence , the court has allowed pre - enforcement ( before the law goes into effect ) injunctions against laws that are unconstitutional on their face .By reading them - like reading New Hampshire 's law - you can read that there is no medical emergency exception , it does not comport with the Constitution .And in those cases , what the court has said is , you can enjoin that law .They did it in Planned Parenthood v. Casey with the requirement in Pennsylvania 's law that a woman must notify her husband .They did n't say this is only unconstitutional for those women in difficult domestic circumstance who can not tell their husbands .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "124.117294"}

{"text": "Some proponents of mandatory parental involvement justify the differential treatment of abortion and other reproductive health services on the ground that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is less a medical choice than a major life decision .Because terminating an unplanned pregnancy can have a significant long - term impact on a woman 's psychological and emotional well - being , they say , parental guidance is especially important .However , states allow minors to make other decisions that can have a lasting effect on their lives .Most states , for example , permit teenagers to drop out high school without their parents ' approval , despite the documented adverse effects associated with the lack of a diploma .Although all states require young people to stay in school at least to age 16 or 17 , except in very limited circumstances , once that age threshold has been reached , the states generally impose no barriers to minors ' deciding to leave .A few states permit a minor to marry without parental consent under certain circumstances , usually pregnancy .Notably , more than half of the states that require parental involvement for abortion permit a pregnant minor to make the decision to continue her pregnancy and to consent to prenatal care and delivery without consulting a parent .In addition , 11 states make no distinction between minor and adult parents ; in these states , it appears , the decision to relinquish her child for adoption rests with the young mother .In practice , it is likely that some adoption agencies and judges ( all adoptions , regardless of the mother 's age , have to be approved by a court ) require that a young woman 's parents be involved in the adoption decision .In principle , however , virtually all states consider a minor mother capable of making an independent decision about whether or not to place her child for adoption ( although a few states require that the minor have a court - appointed guardian ) .Ensuring Minors ' Access to Health Care .Most youth - serving agencies and medical professionals believe that access to confidential services is essential , because many sexually active adolescents will not seek care if they have to inform a parent or have their parent 's consent .\" Minors ' consent laws are extremely important , \" argues Abigail English , director of the Center for Adolescent Health and the Law .\" They encourage young people to seek the health care services they need and enable them to talk candidly with their providers . \"Advocates of parental involvement laws , which include organizations such as Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council , maintain that minors ' consent laws reflect \" an increasing nonchalance about the sanctity of the family unit on the part of the government . \"Government policies , they contend , undermine parental authority and family autonomy .Conservative activists also argue that granting minors access to confidential services is tantamount to condoning sexual activity .Despite access to contraceptives , they say , pregnancy rates among teens remain high .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "129.9021"}
