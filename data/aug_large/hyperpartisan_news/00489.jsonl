Roosevelt signed the day into law as a federal holiday in 1937 , the rest has been history .In an attempt to further thwart the celebration of this \" holiday , \" we at ICTMN have outlined eight misnomers and bloody , greedy , sexually perverse and horrendous atrocities committed by Columbus and his men .After obtaining funding for his explorations to reach Asia from the seizure and sale of properties from Spanish Jews and Muslims by order of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella , Columbus headed out to explore a new world with money and ships .Brimming with the excitement of discovering new land , Columbus offered a reward of 10,000 maravedis or about $ 540 ( a sailor 's yearly salary ) for the first person to discover such land .Though another sailor saw the land in October 1492 , Columbus retracted the reward he had previously offered because he claimed he had seen a dim light in the west .We 're not talking about the Leif Ericson Viking explorer story .We mean Columbus did n't land on the higher 48-ever .Columbus quite literally landed in what is now known as the Bahamas and later Hispaniola , present - day Haiti and the Dominican Republic .Upon arrival , Columbus and his expedition of weapon laden Spaniards met the Arawaks , Tainos and Lucayans - all friendly , according to Columbus ' writings .Soon after arriving , Columbus wrecked the Santa Maria and the Arawaks worked for hours to save the crew and cargo .Impressed with the friendliness of the native people , Columbus seized control of the land in the name of Spain .He also helped himself to some locals .In his journal he wrote : . \" As soon as I arrived in the Indies , on the first Island which I found , I took some of the natives by force in order that they might learn and might give me information of whatever there is in these parts .\" When Columbus first saw the Native Arawaks that came to greet him and his crew he spoke with a peaceful and admiring tone .\" They ... brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things ...They willingly traded everything they owned ...They were well - built , with good bodies and handsome features ....", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.406906"}

Roosevelt signed the day into law as a federal holiday in 1937 , the rest has been history .In an attempt to further thwart the celebration of this \" holiday , \" we at ICTMN have outlined eight misnomers and bloody , greedy , sexually perverse and horrendous atrocities committed by Columbus and his men .After obtaining funding for his explorations to reach Asia from the seizure and sale of properties from Spanish Jews and Muslims by order of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella , Columbus headed out to explore a new world with money and ships .Brimming with the excitement of discovering new land , Columbus offered a reward of 10,000 maravedis or about $ 540 ( a sailor 's yearly salary ) for the first person to discover such land .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.928627"}

{"text": "Another common myth surrounding Columbus ' voyage was that he was the first to discover the \" New World \" .In fact , there is no question that North America was visited by Northern Europeans in the 10th or 11th centuries .Specifically , Norse settlements , one of which has since been excavated , were established in continental North America in the 10th century .The settlements were a failure in part , it appears , due to problems with the Native Americans , who the Norse called Skr\u00e6lings .However , according to recent scholarship , the Norsemen continued to meet and trade with indigenous Americans , at least sporadically , even after the failure of the two colonies they setup .Not the dull oafs of legend and Capital One commercials , the Vikings apparently made a map of their North American conquests .The Vineland map is believed by some to have been made circa 1440 , and demonstrates that at least some Europeans were aware of the existence of continental North America , well before Columbus set sail .Today , there is also increasing evidence , and speculation , that the Americas were visited by Muslim and Chinese explorers long before the \" Age of Discovery \" in the late 15th and 16th centuries .Although still somewhat up for debate , there is evidence that a Muslim sailor , Khashkhash Ibn Saeed Ibn Aswad , traversed the Atlantic and landed in the New World in 889 C.E. In 956 , famed Islamic historian , Abul Hasan Ali Ibn Al Masudi , created a map from his research of this journey that depicts an unknown landmass where America is located .Other voyages to the New World chronicled in Muslim histories includes that of Ibn Farrukh , who seems to have visited islands far to the west of the Canaries in 999 C.E. .Proponents of the Muslim exploration theory repeatedly turn to an intriguing map drawn in the early 16th century by the famous cartographer , Piri Reis .Reportedly copying from ancient documents found in a Turkish library , it is widely accepted that Reis created the map in 1513 .Even though this is after Columbus \" discovered \" the New World , the Piri Reis map depicts the accurate placement of islands and landmasses far before they were visited and mapped by Europeans .In fact , it shows the Andes Mountain range , which was not \" discovered \" by Pizarro until 1527 .In his controversial book , 1421 :The Year China Discovered the World , Gavin Menzies theorized that the great Chinese admiral , Zheng He , commanded an immense fleet that spread across all of the world 's oceans on voyages of discovery between 1421 and 1423 .It is well accepted that Zheng He was a great admiral of the Ming Dynasty and , between 1405 and 1433 , orchestrated at least seven massive naval expeditions to explore the Indian Ocean , as well as the seas of Southeast and South Asia .Intending to extend the power of the Ming Empire across the known world , the fleet established trade throughout Southeast Asia , India , Arabia and the Somali Peninsula .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.605537"}

Kauffman once wrote , \" Italian Americans grounded legitimacy in a pluralistic society by focusing on the Genoese explorer as a central figure in their sense of peoplehood .\" The first state to officially observe Columbus Day was Colorado in 1906 .Instrumental in the creation of the holiday was Angelo Noce , an Italian immigrant who was the founder of Colorado 's first Italian newspaper , La Stella .Noce and fellow Italian - American Siro Mangini dreamed of honoring Christopher Columbus and worked with Colorado 's first Hispanic state Sen. Casimiro Barela , to sponsor a bill proposing a Columbus Day holiday .( Interestingly , Siro Mangini owned a tavern named after Columbus .As his daughter recalled , \" He finally decided to call it Christopher Columbus Hall , thinking that he was [ the ] one Italian [ that ] Americans would not throw rocks at . \" )Within five years of Colorado 's creating the holiday , 14 other states were also celebrating Columbus Day .Not everyone was happy about the possibility of a national holiday to honor Columbus .Around the same time people like Angelo Noce were working to make Columbus Day happen , there was also a movement going on to promote the Viking explorer Leif Erikson .In 1925 , while marking the centennial of the first arrival of Norwegian immigrants to the United States , President Calvin Coolidge told a crowd of thousands at the Minnesota State Fair that he believed that Erikson was the first European to discover America .Erikson is believed to have arrived in what is now Newfoundland , Canada , about 500 years before Columbus ' arrival .This belief is supported by old Norse sagas that say the Vikings reached North America around the year 1000 .In 1930 , Wisconsin became the first state to observe Leif Erikson Day .( The day would become a national day of observance in 1954 and falls on Oct. 9 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.647755"}

{"text": "Contrary to popular belief , not only did Columbus realize the world was round , so did his contemporaries .In fact , it was so well accepted that daring seafarers had been exploring the Atlantic for hundreds of years before Columbus ' time .Without a doubt , men of the early Renaissance knew the world was round , and that the Nina , the Pinta and the Santa Maria were in no danger of sailing over the edge .The ancients were well aware the world was a sphere .Pythagoras ( 6th century B.C. ) is generally credited with having first suggested a round Earth .Aristotle ( 4th century B.C. ) agreed and supported the theory with observations such as that the southern constellations rise higher in the sky when a person travels south .He also noted that during a lunar eclipse , the Earth 's shadow is round .Eratosthenes ( 3rd century B.C. , head librarian at the Library of Alexandria ) built on their ideas and calculated the circumference of the Earth with remarkable accuracy at about 252,000 stadia .Later , the Roman Ptolemy added to the collected wisdom .He observed that as a man approached a far off mountain , it appeared to grow out of the ground - a clear indication of a curved surface .He later devised the forerunner of modern - day longitude and latitude , including measuring what we now call latitude from the equator .In Christian medieval Europe , Bede ( 7th century C.E. ) , a scholar and a Catholic monk , produced an influential treatise that included a discussion of the spherical nature of the world .This work , The Reckoning of Time , was copied and distributed to clerics across the Carolingian empire .Later , in the 1300s , Dante Alighieri 's Divine Comedy also describes the Earth as a sphere .The Catholics were n't the only religious sect that thought the world was round .The Islamic world is known to have consistently maintained the scientific knowledge of the Greeks and Romans , preserving the works of Aristotle and Ptolemy , among others .They were well aware the Earth was round , having calculated with relatively good precision its circumference in the early 9th century .As historian Jeffrey Burton Russell stated , .With extraordinary few exceptions , no educated person in the history of Western Civilization from the third century B.C. onward believed that the Earth was flat .The debate since then among the educated , both religious and secular , was not whether the Earth was approximately a sphere , but exactly what the size of the Earth was .The idea of sailing west to reach India also has its origins in antiquity , with the first known person to mention the notion being the Roman writer Strabo in the 1st century BC , who stated : .Beyond the educated , even the most empty headed sailor knew the Earth was round simply by the fact that ships and the like disappeared over the horizon with the bottom first and then the mast the last to be sighted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.178093"}

Most- correctly -thought Eratosthenes ' estimate was probably reasonably accurate , meaning that if one did not encounter a well stocked land mass in between Spain and Asian to resupply , Columbus ' expedition would end in failure with the crew dying of thirst or starvation .In fact , this would have happened if not for Columbus encountering the Caribbean islands around where he expected to encounter his destination .Queen Isabella eventually sided with Columbus and agreed to finance the expedition , despite the objections of scholars who were consulted over the plan .As to how the myth that people during Medieval times thought the Earth was flat came about , this is up for debate .The myth gained significant traction in the 19th century with various works , such as Andrew Dickson White 's History of the Warfare of Science with Theology .The \" Columbus / Flat Earth Myth \" itself was widely popularized in Washington Irving 's The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus , which was in numerous places largely fiction , though presented as fact and a scholarly work .In fact , there is no first hand record of any such objection to Columbus ' expedition , with the primary documented objections having to do with the length of the journey .One of the only significant Christian works that seems to put forth the notion of a flat Earth was written by an Egyptian Monk in the 6th century AD , Christian Topography .On the whole , though , evidence seems to indicate this work was n't very influential , as you might expect given that most educated Christians were well aware of the mountain of evidence that the world was a sphere .That being said , Christian Topography was often cited as support for the notion that Christians thought the world was flat until recently , with those authors casually ignoring all evidence to the contrary .Another common myth surrounding Columbus ' voyage was that he was the first to discover the \" New World \" .In fact , there is no question that North America was visited by Northern Europeans in the 10th or 11th centuries .Specifically , Norse settlements , one of which has since been excavated , were established in continental North America in the 10th century .The settlements were a failure in part , it appears , due to problems with the Native Americans , who the Norse called Skr\u00e6lings .However , according to recent scholarship , the Norsemen continued to meet and trade with indigenous Americans , at least sporadically , even after the failure of the two colonies they setup .Not the dull oafs of legend and Capital One commercials , the Vikings apparently made a map of their North American conquests .The Vineland map is believed by some to have been made circa 1440 , and demonstrates that at least some Europeans were aware of the existence of continental North America , well before Columbus set sail .Today , there is also increasing evidence , and speculation , that the Americas were visited by Muslim and Chinese explorers long before the \" Age of Discovery \" in the late 15th and 16th centuries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.07712"}

{"text": "The second most important thing i think that Zinn said about Colombus was how he sent back exaggerated reports about his journey .He tells so many lies for a good reputation .He is so afraid to be seen as a failure .He does n't send just one , but multiple reports that lie about what he has been doing in the Americas .He fails to mention his involvment with the indians and his difficulty finding gold .The most important thing that Zinn says about history is that there will always be multiple arguments regarding a topic , but as a historian it is important to just tell things how they were without including an opinion .You do not want to weave in a point of view with the facts .Howard Zinn comes to many conclusions regarding Columbus in the opening chapter of \" A People 's History of the United States \" .The two most important conclusions Zinn draws about Christopher Columbus are that he should not be revered as a hero and that he was one of the reason that slave trade began .Zinn portrays Columbus as a man bent on returning to Spain with plenty of gold in tow , even if that meant killing and enslaving thousands of natives .Furthermore , Zinn describes Columbus ' method of securing gold .Any native that did not find gold had their hands cut off and bled to death .The tyrannical portrait which Zinn paints is hard to ignore , especially as he quotes the journals of Bartolome de las Casas to further validate his thesis that Columbus was not who most believe .Columbus ' part in slavery is another important thing that Zinn says about Columbus .He saw the natives as perfect vessels to carry out work .Columbus is not known for a part in slavery , and Zinn pointing this out is essential to a better view of Christopher Columbus .Howard Zinn also goes over his view of the writing of history .His most important idea on writing history is that it must be creative .He writes that too many historians \" .recapitulate the failures that dominate the past is to make historians collaborators in an endless cycle of defeat .\" This , he says , leads to history blind of looking to the future in order to prevent possible problems .Zinn stresses that history writing should enlighten people so history does not repeat itself .This is the basis of Zinn 's theory on history writing , making it the most important .One important thing about Colomubs is that Zinn is trying to tell us is that he is not the man that he is precieved to be .Zinn describes him as a greedy and evil man .This conflicts with our view of colombus today because we are taught to view him as a hero , someone we should all be thankful to for discovering America .However , Zinn 's picture of colombus makes him look more like a geonocidal tyrant rather then a hero .When Zinn quotes \" La Casa \" we find out from a primary source the eviles Colombus and his men commited to the natives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.02201"}

{"text": "When his thoughts and actions throughout his voyages are considered , one can see that Columbus was never respectful of the rights of the natives he encountered .His first sight of what he termed \" Indians \" was of a group of attractive , unclothed people .Speculation is that , to him , their nakedness represented a lack of culture , customs , and religion ( Wilford 159 ) .Columbus saw this as an opportunity to spread the word of God , while at the same considering how they could possibly be exploited .He believed that they would be easy to conquer because they appeared defenseless , easy to trick because they lacked experience in trade , and an easy source of profit because they could be enslaved ( Fernandez - Armesto 83 ) .It obviously did not occur to Columbus to consider these people in any terms aside from that of master and slave .These thoughts were merely a foreshadowing of what was to come .Even in Columbus 's own letters one can see the arrogance he possessed in claiming the islands he found .In a letter describing his findings to his friend Luis de Santangel , he wrote , \" And there I found very many islands filled with people innumerable , and of them all I have taken possession for their Highnesses .... \" ( 12 ) .Columbus never stopped to consider that these islands were not his to take , nor were the people that inhabited them .He simply took over these lands , even going so far as to rename them all .In order to let everyone know of his great discovery , he returned to Spain with many new items , including kidnapped Indians ( Fernandez - Armesto 89 ) .He was attempting to glorify Spain and its monarchs while creating fame for himself .Columbus 's arrogance and exploitation regarding slavery began on his second voyage .Ferdinand and Isabella had ordered that the natives be treated kindly .In opposition to this order , Columbus began exporting slaves in great numbers in 1494 .It was because he was not making any real profit elsewhere on the island that he decided to exploit the one source of income -- people -- he had in abundance ( Fernandez - Armesto 107 ) .When word reached him that the crown did not want him sending more slaves , Columbus ignored it .He was desperate to make his expeditions profitable enough for Ferdinand and Isabella 's continued support .Evidently he was not reprimanded because thousands of Indians were exported .By the time they reached Spain , usually a third of them were dead .Bartolome de las Casas wrote that one Spaniard had told him they did not need a compass to find their way back to Spain ; they could simply follow the bodies of floating Indians who had been tossed overboard when they died ( 17 ) .It is horrible to consider that the exportation of these natives resulted in thousands of deaths .It is much worse when one realizes that they were caused by one man 's desire for glory .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.503914"}

{"text": "Zinn presents a very mature method of documenting history .He gives us the idea that you need to hear about the bad as well as the good .For a long time people ignored the atrocities committed by Colombus because they looked upon him as a hero , the founder of America .However upon closer analyses one may find that Colombus is nt such a great hero after all .Reading books by authors with a similar understanding of history as Zinn will open our eyes and let us make our own opinion on people such as Colombus .Its important to always remember the bad as well as the good because if anything should be embellished , it should nt be history .In order to learn from our past we need to have all the facts , to make our own judgements and only then can we grow as a people .Howard Zinn described Columbus as a man sent on a voyage in search of great riches for the country of Spain and in his search , exploited any resources in which benefit him on his search .Through conquering foreign territory , Columbus used the Native peoples to his advantage and nearly wiped out 90 % of their population in doing so .Zinn explains how Columbus was determined to discover a nonexistent treasure where he had practically became a parasite on the land he plagued .He leeched the Native 's for the agricultural methods and later turned on them in his desperate greed .Zinn feels that when writing history , the use of unbiased facts and creativity are necessary in writing successfully .If opinion should be present , it is the author 's responsibility to utilize ideas from both arguing sides to provide accurate data .The First important thing that Zinn stated about Columbus is the basic fact that he commited genocide to all the people in the new world by opening up their wonderful world of peace to disease and harsh labor .Once the diseases Europeans carried over started attacking many people the death rate grew higher and the Indian population shrunk .Instead of figuring out how to learn the ropes of for farming and hunting , Columbus took advantage of what the indian people knew and enslaved them so all the harsh labor can be done for them .After Columbus started the slave trade Africa became a huge part of history .Africans had a very demographic background which was basically calling the Europeans to make them all slaves .The Africans were shipped back and forth around the world in unsanitary tightly squeezed ships making them become the main reason for a rise agriculturally and economically for Europeans .If it was nt for Spain realizing how harsh the slaves were treated slavery could still be active today .The second important thing Zinn Stated about Columbus is how when he got to the new world he began colonizing as soon as he could , bringing the slaves with himc .Columbus took the native people and enslaved them as if they were violating his land and as their punishment they had to be forced into doing all the labor the Europeans wanted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.12574"}

{"text": "In 1491 , he went again to the Spanish court , accompanied by his son Diego .The court was in Granada , Spain , which was the last stand for the Moors , where the Spanish were currently fighting what was called the Reconquista .He was again turned away , because the king could not be distracted from expelling the Moors , and Columbus was left to wander around the streets of Spain with Diego .He had to beg for shelter , but not for very long .He set out to Palos , Spain on his mule and perhaps ask the king of France to finance his voyage .He was on a mule alone , when something happened .A messenger of the monarchs asked him to return to see the King and Queen .When the king took back Granada in 1492 , the Reconquista was over and Spain was completely Christian .Now that the court was not so distracted , as it had been for centuries , Columbus was called before Queen Isabella of Spain .She gave him some money to to make his appearance suitable for the King .The King and Queen decided to finance Columbus 's voyage , Isabella in the interests of spreading Christianity and Ferdinand because it could bring wealth and glory .As many know , the goal of many voyages around that time were for the ' 3 G 's ' - God , Gold and Glory .This venture was exactly for that .Columbus signed a deal with Spain on 17 April and on 30 April .The deal said that Columbus could govern over any lands he found and was entitled to 10 % of his land 's revenue .About half of the voyage was to be financed by investors , and Columbus set them up .The story that Isabella had to sell the crown jewels to pay for the voyage is a myth .With investors and favours used , the country really did n't have to use very much money to pay for the voyage .The First Voyage .Columbus was made Admiral of the High Seas by the Monarchs and was given three small ships- the Ni\u00f1a , the Pinta and the Santa Maria ( originally named the Pelican ) .The Santa Maria , nicknamed La Gallega , was the most important ship , but was not built for travel .It was a slow - moving cargo ship .The Santa Maria was led by Columbus .The Pinta was a caravel , and was the swiftest sailor of the three .She was captained by Mart\u00edn Alonso Pinz\u00f3n .The Nina was the smallest of the ships , and led by Vicente A\u00f1es Pinz\u00f3n ( who was brother of Mart\u00edn , the captain of the Nina ) .On the ships were about 87 people as the crew , who were gathered by Mart\u00edn Alonso Pinz\u00f3n .They were experienced sea - men , and four of them had taken an offer from the Spanish throne for amnesty from prison if they took the voyage .Many of these sailors were from the nearby towns of Lepe and Moguer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.38663"}

{"text": "Many of Las Casas 's subsequent works consist largely of excerpts from these two histories .His most famous , the Brev\u00edsima relaci\u00f3n de la destrucci\u00f3n de las Indias ( The Devastation of the Indies : A Brief Account , 1552 ) , was his only work published before his death .Written in 1542 and published ten years later in Seville without the consent of the Royal Council , the Brief Account was Las Casas 's most acrimonious assault on Spanish colonial policies .It was officially banned in Spain by the Holy Tribunal of Zaragoza in 1660 , but new editions appeared periodically throughout Europe .Critical Reception .During his lifetime , many Spanish nationalists and governmental officials characterized Las Casas as a traitor and a fanatic who should be publically reprimanded and whose writings should be banned .Despite the negative reception in his homeland , Las Casas 's influence had enduring political repercussions .His defense at Valladolid influenced Philip II 's 1573 ordinance regulating the use of armed force during new conquests .His Brief Account was used as a source of anti - Spanish propaganda by the English at the end of the sixteenth century , and later by other countries including the Netherlands , Italy , Germany , France , and the United States .Some modern Spanish historians still characterize Las Casas as delusional and dangerous , but many others contend that his often exaggerated testimony and somewhat dubious statistics do not significantly lessen the value of either his analyses or his humanitarian principles .Brev\u00edsima relaci\u00f3n de la destrucci\u00f3n de las Indias [ The Devastation of the Indies : A Brief Account ] ( polemical history )1552 .Apolog\u00eda [ In Defense of the Indians ] ( speech ) c.1552 .The manuscript was published in 1875 .A version was published in 1951 .SOURCE : A preface to The Life of Las Casas : \" The Apostle of the Indies , \" George Bell and Sons , 1890 , pp .v - xv .[ In the following excerpt , from a biography originally published in 1867 , Helps presents a laudatory characterization of Las Casas as a historian , philanthropist , and a highly original thinker .] It is well known that he has ever been put in the foremost rank of philanthropists ; but he had other qualifications which were also extraordinary .He was not a mere philanthropist , possessed only with one idea .He had one of those large minds which take an interest in everything .The ways , the customs , the religion , the policy , the laws , of the new people whom he saw , the new animals , the new trees , the new herbs , were all observed and chronicled by him .In an age eminently superstitious , he was entirely devoid of superstition .In fact his works would , even in the present day , form the best manual extant for missionaries .He had certainly great advantages : he lived in most stirring times ; he was associated with the greatest personages of his day ; and he had the privilege of taking part in the discovery and colonization of a new world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.446075"}
{"text": "Las Casas later regretted this statement and believed that all slavery was wrong ( Pierce , 1 - 4 ) .Searching for the enigma that propelled Las Casas , philosophers generally accept one of two theories .First , he was either largely Thomistic ; or second , he was just an activist without a coherent position .One common belief among these circles is that Las Casas received much inspiration from St. Thomas Aquinas and his school of philosophy ( Pennington , 2 ) .Scholars have also long debated whether medieval or Renaissance influences were the basis of Las Casas ' thoughts .Las Casas was a master of the Scholastic methods of argumentation .He was also a child of the Renaissance .Las Casas can be credited with aiding the direction of European thought toward the concept that all men should be treated free and equal .He believed that humans should be liberated and capable of movement into cultural evolution .During the years that Las Casas championed the rights of the Indians , he gradually shifted from moral tactics like sermonizing and persuasion and threatening to endorse political measures like the New Laws of 1542 ( Keen , 1 - 12 ) .Perhaps , if Las Casas could tell us why he championed the Indians cause , it would be simply that he saw Jesus in these people ( Pierce , 4 ) .Possibly there was no grand philosophical structure or scheme guiding his argumentation .Maybe , he just followed his heart .In conclusion , Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas became a champion for the rights of the Indians by living among them and working with them in the New World .Throughout the life of Las Casas , he insisted that the Indians ' claims to the title of their lands were legal and just .He maintained that the evangelization of the Indians was based on the gospel of wealth , not salvation .He pursued the truth for his life .He broke through political and social barriers of class and reason .He traveled a road that brought him closer to the meaning of life .As one of the many , noble defenders of principle and justice , standing together with others across time and space , Bartolome de Las Casas has proven - one individual can make a difference .Bibliography .Bartolome de las Casas Manuscripts ( Vol . )William L.

{"text": "[34 ] Las Casas ' Confesionario was designed to enforce all the New Laws .The confessor was to deny absolution to anyone who profited from Indian life and land .Moreover , since these rules asserted the illegality of the encomienda system and the conquest - a defiance of royal authority , because it was the king who had granted them -- he was questioning royal authority .This amounted to his questioning the divine rights of kings .He would surely have been charged with treason , punishable by death if the rules had leaked out .This is true because it seems that Las Casas wrote his Confesionario partially in response to the Emperor 's revocation of important parts of the New Laws on November 20 , 1545 .Charles V gave into the arguments and petitions of the representatives of the colonists at court .In anticipation of this accusation Las Casas wrote a letter to the Regent , Crown Prince Philip , who was in charge of the Spanish dominions in the Emperor 's absence , arguing for ecclesiastical exemption from the coercive power of secular princes .[ 35 ] Even with his preemptive defensive letter to Philip , his manual became known and raised a political as well as an ecclesiastical storm .After attending the meeting of bishops and church leaders in Mexico City , he returned to Spain in 1547 .He would never see the New World again and later resigned his bishopric .By this time in his life , it seems that he understood that his true place was at court , and that there he alone could serve as the much - needed \" universal procurator \" of his beloved Indians .[36 ] The beleaguered Bishop probably did not foresee that he would first have to serve as procurator in his own cause .[ 37 ] .Back in Spain in 1547 , Las Casas encountered accusations concerning his now public Confesionario .His defense against charges of high treason from his detractors , for his confessors manual , reached its climax when he debated the humanist Juan Gin\u00e9s Sep\u00falveda .In his counterattack Las Casas challenged Sep\u00falveda 's Democrates Secundus , a tract that justified waging war in the process of the conquest in order to \" christianize \" the peoples of the Americas .Las Casas debated Sep\u00falveda at the Junta de Valladolid of 1550 - 1551 where the judges of the exchange were a panel of fourteen distinguished religious and laity , of whom four were fellow Dominicans .Sep\u00falveda appeared the first day and gave a three - hour summary of the doctrine of his Democrates Secundus to the Junta .For the next five days , Las Casas offered his rebuttal , Argumentum Apologiae , countering that , even if some of the Indians were guilty of human sacrifice and cannibalism , it could be explained as a rational step in the development of religious thought .[ 38 ]Although no verdict was handed down , the royal c\u00e9dulas of the Council of the Indies continued to apply the thesis of Las Casas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.33444"}
