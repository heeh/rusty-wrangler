{"text": "\" Pete Williams , Cynthia McFadden and Robert Windrem of NBC News contributed to this report .French economist Thomas Piketty sat down with Newsnight host Evan Davis to discuss the wealth inequality caused by capitalism and the importance of taxes , as well as philanthropy .He also spoke about his support for Labour under Jeremy Corbyn .Piketty will join the economic advisory panel assembled by John McDonnell to shape Labour 's future economic policy .Share this : .This weekend , something important happened .As a Labour Party member , I received an email from the party leader asking for my views on whether the UK should join in the bombing of ISIL in Syria .At the same time , many Labour MPs are furious , with some Labour sources apparently claiming that this was \" undemocratic \" .This reaction - Orwellian in a precise sense - is deeply illustrative of the problem Labour faces , which is , in its turn , a comment on the conduct of politics in modern Britain .It 's not just that this shows that many in the mainstream of politics define \" democracy \" in a very partial way ; but how ideological the language of everyday political discourse has come .Actually , on examination , the very opposite is the case .By contrast , Corbynomics looks like a simple return to economic basics relying on a sober and above all pragmatic assessment of Britain 's economic weaknesses .The same is true on the biggest foreign policy issue of the day : Cameron 's drive to involve Britain in bombing ISIL in Syria .The point about the case against war - as expressed by Jeremy Corbyn and others - is that it is essentially a rational one , as distinct from the combination of wishful thinking and post - imperial essentialism on which the case for war appears to depend .Or democracy itself .Ultimately , when authenticity is elsewhere , reality has a habit of catching up with you .Sometimes the cognitive bias can be astonishing .I have seen members of Progress , with its membership structure and millionaire funders - arguing on social media that Momentum is a party with a party .It 's perhaps this absence of self - awareness that explains why the Labour establishment did n't see Corbyn coming and still ca n't understand how the forces that carried Corbyn to the leadership reflect real changes in the way in which people perceive the need for change .And by asking members for their views on Syria , Corbyn is demonstrating his confidence in his new honest , collaborative approach to politics .I think the Corbyn leadership has made some serious errors .In the face of unrelenting hostility from both the media and from within the Labour Party itself , Corbyn and those around him needed to be rather more circumspect .But it remains grounded in reality in a way that its critics - political and media - just are n't .And as Labour 's traditional right prepares to line up to vote for yet another potentially disastrous war , it needs perhaps to reflect long and hard about who in this debate reflects empirical reality , and who are the ideologues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.23783"}
{"text": "Share this : .I do not support the proposal for bombing in Syria that is currently dominating the headlines .The horrendous events that took place in Paris weeks ago have inevitably caused calls for escalation in military intervention to combat ISIS .President Hollande openly declared war , and can hardly be blamed for such an emotional response to the second Islamist extremist atrocity to occur in his capital city this year .Similarly in the UK , David Cameron has also made the case for bombing Syria , where ISIS are headquartered .Opinion is severely divided , with Cameron 's announcement met by a march for peace .Jeremy Corbyn , the Leader of the Opposition who opposes military intervention , has also been left fighting a war of wills against much of his Shadow Cabinet , with many of them threatening to defy the party whip in order to back the government 's plans .Corbyn has since stated that Labour 's position is against bombing , but has given members a free vote .However , I do not oppose bombing in Syria because of Iraq .The fight against ISIS is not the same as the situation was in Iraq , and the possibility of military action should not be ruled out just because of guilt from our previous involvement , although lessons must of course be learned .We must understand that the instability that we helped to create has assisted ISIS in gaining a foothold in the region .Thousands of civilians lost their lives , and the major cause of these losses was the supposedly coordinated bombing that we carried out .Bombing , no matter how well intentioned , leads to the loss of innocent life .Always .There have already been air strikes in Syria , and they have led to thousands of civilian casualties .Syrian refugees are already fleeing a civil war and the threat of ISIS ; we must not add our bombs to that list .There are several justifications used to support bombing .The first , and of course most important to the majority of ordinary people , is to protect our streets .We are under threat from ISIS , I would not argue for a moment that we were not .But we are not under the threat of a military invasion from a recognised state , and our defence policy must reflect this .We are most threatened by much harder to detect lone wolf attacks , unfortunately often carried out by people born within our own borders , who align with the murderous ideology of a terrorist organisation that hides in plain sight amongst many civilians in the Middle East .We are not fighting an army in uniform .If we were to carry out air strikes on anywhere that harboured Islamist extremists , bombs would not fall very far from us .Moreover bombing is expensive , with each mission easily costing a million pounds .Now financial cost should not be the deciding factor in such a moral argument , but that money could instead be used to improve our intelligence services , put more police on the streets and properly equip them to deal with attacks like Paris .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.49602"}
