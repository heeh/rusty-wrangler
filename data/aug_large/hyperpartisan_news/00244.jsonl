John Sununu and Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen .Sununu 's 19,000-vote victory helped the GOP regain control of the Senate .While there were guilty pleas in the New Hampshire investigation prior to the 2004 presidential election , involvement of the national GOP was n't confirmed .A Manchester , N.H. , policeman quickly traced the jamming to Republican political operatives in 2003 and forwarded the evidence to the Justice Department for what ordinarily would be a straightforward case .However , the official , who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter , told McClatchy that senior Justice Department officials slowed the inquiry .The official did n't know whether top department officials ordered the delays or what motivated those decisions .The official said that Terry O'Donnell , a former Pentagon general counsel who was representing Tobin , was in contact with senior department officials before Tobin was indicted .In October , the House Judiciary Committee opened an investigation to determine whether partisan politics undermined the federal probe .The official said that department officials rejected prosecutor Todd Hinnen 's push to bring criminal charges against the New Hampshire Republican Party .The delay also stalled the case beyond its statute of limitations , depriving Democrats of full discovery , he said .Citing longstanding policy , spokesman Peter Carr said the Justice Department would n't comment on its investigation .Four men have been convicted in the scandal , including McGee and Republican consultant Allen Raymond , who arranged to jam the phones .Their cooperation led to Tobin 's indictment .In mid - October 2004 , Tobin resigned as the Bush - Cheney campaign 's regional director after a news report disclosed allegations of his involvement .Bush narrowly lost New Hampshire , the only state he won in 2000 that went for Democrat John Kerry .Hinnen , now an aide to Democratic presidential candidate and Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden , said he could n't comment on the investigation .Tobin was convicted in December 2005 of charges related to the scheme , but won a new trial on appeal .His lawyers did n't respond to e - mailed questions .National Republican committees have paid more than $ 6 million to Washington law firms to defend Tobin and fight the civil suit , raising suspicions that there 's more to the scandal .Rep. Paul Hodes , a New Hampshire Democrat who requested the House inquiry , said he considers the delay in indicting Tobin to be ' ' a miscarriage of justice .

{"text": "\" If people want a peek at the defense on the e - mail scandal that will come from Team Hillary will mount - sans Hillary Clinton , at least for a while - check out this exchange between Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace and longtime Clintonland figure Lanny Davis .His very presence on FNS shows just how much Hillary wants to stand up for herself , and after watching this exchange , it 's pretty clear why .Davis insists that Hillary did n't do anything illegal , but also that she did nothing wrong , and Wallace ca n't believe it : \" .The subpoenas from the Republican - led Select Committee on Benghazi demanded additional material from Clinton and others related to Libya , spokesman Jamal D. Ware said .The panel also instructed technology companies it did not identify to preserve any relevant documents in their possession .The development on Capitol Hill came the same day The Associated Press reported the existence of a personal email server traced back to the Chappaqua , New York , home of Clinton .The unusual practice of a Cabinet - level official running her own email server would have given Clinton - who is expected to run for president in the 2016 campaign - significant control over limiting access to her message archives .The practice also would complicate the State Department 's legal responsibilities in finding and turning over official emails in response to any investigations , lawsuits or public records requests .The department would be in the position of accepting Clinton 's assurances she was surrendering everything required that was in her control .\" The mystery deepens with the revelation of exactly who was in charge of Sec .Clinton 's private server , one Eric Hoteham , a man with a long Clintonian association : .The former president 's full name is William Jefferson Clinton .Hothem , the former Clinton aide , surfaced in at least two Clinton administration controversies .A congressional report in 2002 investigating pardons said a Citibank account linked to Hothem wired $ 15,000 to President Clinton 's brother , Roger , in March 2001 , while investigators were trying to compel Roger Clinton to testify about his role in several pardon cases .The president 's lawyer told investigators the money came from a personal account of the Clintons and was intended for Clinton 's brother to hire a lawyer . \" \" Monday night , it was revealed that Hillary Clinton used a personal email account the entire time she served as Secretary of State .Not only does conducting official business with a private account violate federal law , it raises a host of concerns ranging from whether or not her communications were secure from foreign intelligence services , to whether we 'll be able to piece together an accurate historical record .Given Hillary Clinton 's legal troubles in the 1990s relating to keeping track of documents , it seems implausible she was not aware of the illegality of what was going on .But one aspect of this story that deserves special focus is what this revelation about the former secretary of state 's peculiar email habits tell us about how thorough the investigations of Benghazi have been to date .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.73499"}
