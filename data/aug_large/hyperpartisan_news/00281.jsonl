{"text": "Should the reality of Communist espionage cause us to reassess our views of McCarthyism in America ?Many Americans today are critical of the anticommunist hysteria of the 1950s , decrying the systematic violation of civil liberties inherent in the anticommunist inquisition .But - considering the fact that some American Communists were , in fact , spying for the Soviets , and that McCarthyite proceedings did lead to convictions of real Soviet spies - is it possible that legitimate Cold War ends justified regrettable McCarthyite means ?Red Scare .Introduction .As the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States intensified in the late 1940s and early 1950s , hysteria over the perceived threat posed by Communists in the U.S. became known as the Red Scare .( Communists were often referred to as \" Reds \" for their allegiance to the red Soviet flag . )The Red Scare led to a range of actions that had a profound and enduring effect on U.S. government and society .Federal employees were analyzed to determine whether they were sufficiently loyal to the government , and the House Un - American Activities Committee , as well as U.S. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , investigated allegations of subversive elements in the government and the Hollywood film industry .The climate of fear and repression linked to the Red Scare finally began to ease by the late 1950s .Cold War Concerns about Communism .Following World War II ( 1939 - 45 ) , the democratic United States and the communist Soviet Union became engaged in a series of largely political and economic clashes known as the Cold War .The intense rivalry between the two superpowers raised concerns in the United States that Communists and leftist sympathizers inside America might actively work as Soviet spies and pose a threat to U.S. security .Did You Know ?FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was quick to equate any kind of protest with communist subversion , including the civil rights demonstrations led by Martin Luther King Jr. Hoover labeled King a communist and covertly worked to intimidate and discredit the civil rights leader .Such ideas were not totally unfounded .The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) had long carried out espionage activities inside America with the aid of U.S. citizens , particularly during World War II .As apprehension about Soviet influence grew as the Cold War heated up , U.S. leaders decided to take action .On March 21 , 1947 , President Harry S. Truman ( 1884 - 1972 ) issued Executive Order 9835 , also known as the Loyalty Order , which mandated that all federal employees be analyzed to determine whether they were sufficiently loyal to the government .Truman 's loyalty program was a startling development for a country that prized the concepts of personal liberty and freedom of political organization .Yet it was only one of many questionable activities that occurred during the period of anticommunist hysteria known as the Red Scare .Probing Red Influence .One of the pioneering efforts to investigate communist activities took place in the U.S. House of Representatives , where the House Un - American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) was formed in 1938 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.628708"}

Edgar Hoover ( 1895 - 1972 ) , aided many of the legislative investigations of communist activities .An ardent anticommunist , Hoover had been a key player in an earlier , though less pervasive , Red Scare in the years following World War I ( 1914 - 18 ) .With the dawning of the new anticommunist crusade in the late 1940s , Hoover 's agency compiled extensive files on suspected subversives through the use of wiretaps , surveillance and the infiltration of leftist groups .The information obtained by the FBI proved essential in high - profile legal cases , including the 1949 conviction of 12 prominent leaders of the American Communist Party on charges that they had advocated the overthrow of the government .Moreover , Hoover 's agents helped build the case against Julius Rosenberg ( 1918 - 53 ) and his wife , Ethel Rosenberg ( 1915 - 53 ) , who were convicted of espionage in 1951 and executed two years later .Hysteria and Growing Conservatism .Public concerns about communism were heightened by international events .In 1949 , the Soviet Union successfully tested a nuclear bomb and communist forces led by Mao Zedong ( 1893 - 1976 ) took control of China .The following year saw the start of the Korean War ( 1950 - 53 ) , which engaged U.S. troops in combat against the communist - supported forces of North Korea .The advances of communism around the world convinced many U.S. citizens that there was a real danger of \" Reds \" taking over their own country .Figures such as McCarthy and Hoover fanned the flames of fear by wildly exaggerating that possibility .As the Red Scare intensified , its political climate turned increasingly conservative .Elected officials from both major parties sought to portray themselves as staunch anticommunists , and few people dared to criticize the questionable tactics used to persecute suspected radicals .Membership in leftist groups dropped as it became clear that such associations could lead to serious consequences , and dissenting voices from the left side of the political spectrum fell silent on a range of important issues .In judicial affairs , for example , support for free speech and other civil liberties eroded significantly .This trend was symbolized by the 1951 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Dennis v.

Schlesinger Jr. never had any problem proclaiming that Alger Hiss was guilty .Yet when Comintern files found by Klehr and Haynes reinforced the ex - Soviet agent Elizabeth Bentley 's charge that Laurence Duggan , a onetime New Deal official , had been a Soviet asset , Schlesinger responded that he knew Duggan and did not believe he could have been a spy .When Duggan 's role as a KGB agent was confirmed by the Venona files , Schlesinger privately conceded that the documents were \" pretty damning \" but never publicly changed his position .Jacoby ends up in the same corner as Schlesinger .Commenting on the evidence assembled by Klehr and Haynes in their various studies , she writes , \" I find it difficult to place total faith in the information that one intelligence agent passes on to another .\" But what Klehr and Haynes have uncovered is not simply uncorroborated files from agents but information that is corroborated with other files that point incontrovertibly to the fact that the man named \" Ales \" by the KGB was no one but Alger Hiss .Jacoby , however , prefers to stand above the fray , concluding that \" what each side truly hates is the other 's version of history .\" True enough .But only one version of this particular history can be correct , and Susan Jacoby can not decide which one .She seems more concerned that she might be confused with \" right - wing ideologists \" associated with George W.

Schlesinger Jr. never had any problem proclaiming that Alger Hiss was guilty .Yet when Comintern files found by Klehr and Haynes reinforced the ex - Soviet agent Elizabeth Bentley 's charge that Laurence Duggan , a onetime New Deal official , had been a Soviet asset , Schlesinger responded that he knew Duggan and did not believe he could have been a spy .When Duggan 's role as a KGB agent was confirmed by the Venona files , Schlesinger privately conceded that the documents were \" pretty damning \" but never publicly changed his position .Jacoby ends up in the same corner as Schlesinger .Commenting on the evidence assembled by Klehr and Haynes in their various studies , she writes , \" I find it difficult to place total faith in the information that one intelligence agent passes on to another .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.07071"}

Woodson and Kenneth Clark .However the fundamental moral error of racism which underlies White Supremacy is easily identifiable without scholarly research .People basically understand that racism is wrong and have for many generations .This is why White Supremacists have gone to great lengths in order to justify their their theories .Every generation has its slew of crackpots who attempt to ' scientifically ' prove the genetic superiority of the so - called white race and various aspects of the inferiority of other so - called races .Like any immoral system , White Supremacy must be taught .By removing the legal apparatus of Jim Crow society , the Civil Rights Movement and laws dealt a death blow to the continuing institutionalization and reinforcement of White Supremacy in America .This did not level the playing field , but it did take away the apparatus for digging more holes in it .As economist Glenn Loury identified , the defeat of Jim Crow was a great legal and moral victory , but like craters in the battlefield long after the war has been decided , all is not even .Many African Americans , perhaps as much as 40 % living in America today below middle class status , still live in those craters .I call them ghettos .They are the same segregated areas today , and predominantly African American that they were before the end of the Jim Crow Era .These ghettos , designated in the Jim Crow era to separate African Americans from mainstream American institutions of education , health care , legal representation , government services are often more dysfunctional communities than their distance from quality institutions might suggest .There is also a human cost born in the psyches of ghetto residents .It is for lack of a better term , and yet well understood ' the ghetto mentality ' , and it is a the significant result of an internalization of the premises of White Supremacy .The underclass of African Americans suffer not only because of the legacy of the material deprivations designed into American Jim Crow , but because they have been psychologically damaged by White Supremacy .Ultimately they did so .Viewed in historic and cross - national perspective , the legal and political transformation of American race relations since World War II represents a remarkable achievement , powerfully confirming the virtue of our political institutions .Official segregation , which some southerners as late as 1960 were saying would live forever , is dead .The caste system of social domination enforced with open violence has been eradicated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.479324"}

{"text": "In lieu of the maligned concept of racism , Rattansi proposes the use of the social scientific term \" racialization \" as a more apt concept .Racialization focuses on the degree or extent of racism or \" racisms , \" particularly factors of strong racism , present in any situation or case of systemic racism .It moves away from the simplistic binary pattern of racist or not racist to discern degrees of racialized practice or discourse .Attention to racialization thus allows us to take into account arguments based on some form of biological determinism and cultural patterns , as well as to blur the superior / inferior distinctions since some racial stereotypes - the \" clever Jew , \" for instance - do not lend themselves to neat categorizations .Although Rattansi does not pursue the notion of theological discourse , it could also be investigated as a dynamic within this concept of racialization and , in keeping with the argument at hand , should be investigated .Rattansi 's argument for thinking in terms of degrees or extent of racism has merit .Consider the National Basketball Association 's 2011 lockout and the media frenzy around ESPN analyst Bryant Gumbel 's remarks comparing Commissioner David Stern 's approach to that of a \" modern plantation overseer .\" The debate surrounding Gumbel 's comparison focused on the question of whether or not Stern is a racist .It was exactly the binary logic to which Rattansi points .Because racism can appear in multiple forms , resisting simplistic either - or arguments enables us to discern nuanced manifestations as well as quite overt ones .Anthony Appiah , in a similar vein , questions the notion of racial identity as constructed in contemporary society .Appiah focuses on the complexity and multiplicity of \" identity \" as a term that first appeared in the 1950s to suggest that personal identity is shaped by race , ethnicity , gender , religion , nationality , even sexuality .He argues , \" Once labels are applied to people , ideas about people who fit the label come to have social and psychological effects . \"Appiah goes on to suggest a particular threefold structure to collective identities or groups related to features such as race and gender .First , public discourse requires terms that can label certain identifiable characteristics .While the conceptual boundaries are not precise , the broad category is generally understood .Second , at least some of the people who bear those labels will internalize the category as part of their identity .In this sense , the label may shape a person 's feelings , actions , or behavioral norms and , at the same time , will enable the person to locate himor herself within collective narratives .A person 's personal story can be understood as part of a larger story .The third structure to collective or group identities shapes the patterns of behavior toward such labels or the treatment that these labeled or named groups receive .Discrimination can be considered one form of treatment , but behavioral patterns can also take a benevolent form .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.77809"}

{"text": "Later in the trip , I had an opportunity to meet socially with several Nigerians .Among my fellow travelers there was a tendency to speak of American blacks as if we were Africans living abroad , everyday Africans did not share this view .They saw us as Americans , first and always .Even to the Nigerians I met who , by and large , were educated in the West we were as American as , well , George Bush . ...That 's not to say I did not feel the tug of Africa at all .I discovered that it is very difficult to be a black American and experience Africa purely as an American .Everywhere I looked , there were bits and pieces of myself .Black Americans , like Italian - Americans , Irish - Americans , or Polish - Americans , are very much African but moreso very much American .The estimated date for final importation of slaves from Africa is in the mid-1800s .That leaves a century and a half in which generational Black Americans are most likely to have had ancestors directly from Africa .Within two centuries , however , Black Americans have evolved from African culture and developed their own kind of culture relative to the United States alone .As a result , being Black in America is not simply a matter of race , it is also a matter of culture .Race and culture are now inevitably intertwined .So when I think of Black pride , I do n't necessarily think of Black Americans taking pride in the color of their skin but rather who they are as a culture that happens to be connected to the color of their skin .I do like the way the writer of the wikipedia entry on African American culture put it : .For many years African American culture developed separately from mainstream American culture because of the persistence of racial discrimination in America , as well as African American slave descendants ' desire to maintain their own traditions .Today , African American culture has become a significant part of American culture and yet , at the same time , remains a distinct cultural body .There is a style of worship , a style of music , a form of art , and a form of dance that is intrinsic to Black American culture .While some of it may be derived from Africa , it has evolved over the centuries to become uniquely Black American ( or African - American , if you will ) .But then I wonder whether if it 's sinful to have Black pride within a cultural context and I do n't believe so .Just like the ethnic pride of being Spanish , Germanic , or Swedish , I do n't believe pride in immutable , nonsinful qualities is wrong - it 's the way God made us !Where it does start to go wrong is when these groups use their ethnic position as a form of superiority , especially in order to oppress one group over another .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.71153"}

Wellman argued that the traditional definition of racism as prejudice - defined as \" a combination of hostility toward and faulty generalizations about racial groups\"-was inadequate to account for America 's racial attitudes .Although the sentiments of many white Americans regarding racial issues \" may not be prejudiced , \" Wellman wrote , \" they justify arrangements that in effect , if not in intent , maintain the status quo and thereby keep blacks in subordinate positions .\" [ Emphasis added . ] Wellman wanted racism to be seen not as a psychological attitude , but as institutionally generated inequality , as structural superiority .\" The subordination of people of color is functional to the operation of American society as we know it ... .Racism is a structural relationship based on the subordination of one racial group by another . \"Racism , then , is not a psychological or moral flaw , and thus an exception to the rule ; it is the rule .What Wellman saw as the advantage of this social definition of racism ( its transcendence of the idea of mere individual prejudice ) is precisely , I would suggest , its fatal drawback .By transferring a word connoting the deepest moral evil to an entire society , while divorcing that word from the idea of intent , the structural definition of racism destroys the idea of individual moral responsibility while at the same time making everyone guilty .It is a perversion of language that lends itself to exactly the kind of vicious generalization that it condemns .Though formulated in the neutral language of the social sciences , the structural definition inevitably leads - in the name of ending race hatred - to a new , more virulent ( because ostensibly justified ) race hatred .Thus the black filmmaker Spike Lee could make , with impunity , the remark that white people see blacks in only two ways : as celebrities , or as \" niggers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.027054"}

Roosevelt ( 1882 - 1945 ) .Did You Know ?One of the members of HUAC in the late 1940s was a first - term U.S. representative from California named Richard Nixon .Nixon played a prominent role in the Alger Hiss spy hearings in 1948 ; 20 years later , he was elected the 37th president of the United States .As tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union intensified following World War II ( 1939 - 45 ) , the committee took up its investigations of communist activities with new vigor .Particularly after 1947 , HUAC assumed new heights of prominence and notoriety , and the committee conducted a series of high - profile hearings alleging that Communists disloyal to the U.S. had infiltrated government , schools , the entertainment industry and many other areas of American life .Subpoenas and Blacklists .The committee employed several controversial methods to accomplish its goal of ferreting out suspected Communists .Typically , an individual who raised the suspicions of HUAC received a subpoena to appear before the committee .During the hearing , the suspected Communist was grilled about his or her political beliefs and activities and then asked to provide the names of other people who had taken part in allegedly subversive activities .Any additional figures identified in this manner also received subpoenas , widening the committee 's probe .Individuals who refused to answer the committee 's questions or to provide names could be indicted for contempt of Congress and sent to prison .Subjects of HUAC investigations had the option of invoking their right to avoid self - incrimination under the Fifth Amendment , but \" pleading the Fifth \" created the impression that they were guilty of a crime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.120514"}

''Blackness ' must be updated so that blacks can free themselves from the past and lead America into the future . ' 'One of the biggest business ventures in the United States , the diet industry , is nothing more than a huge advice mill .Americans , black and white , are suckers for advice because they are so inspired by the efficacy of self - improvement .Although most black polemicists bristle at the suggestion that blacks are pathological , these books are driven by the view that the behavior and thinking that need correcting are so self - defeating as to require public censure .I find the prescriptive nature of this book and the others like it , including my own when they have been guilty of it , presumptuous and off - putting .The End of Blackness ' ' opens by criticizing blacks for saying that they do n't feel American , for marginalizing themselves , for the imprisoning conformity of group racial consciousness . ''And the real enemy are middle - class blacks , bourgie blase blacks , as Dickerson calls them , because these are the blacks who feel ' ' least at home .

Bush won 44 percent of Latino voters , but since then no Republican candidate has received even a respectable minority .In 2012 Mitt Romney advocated self - deportation and was rewarded with 27 percent of the Hispanic vote .This year most election watchers believe that the Republican nominees must have at least 40 percent of the Hispanic ballots in order to have a shot at the White House .A recent MSNBC / Univision / Marist poll , however , found that if elections were held last month Hillary Clinton would win 69 percent of the Latino vote and Donald Trump 27 percent .Her numbers among Hispanics against Cruz , Rubio and Bush were also blowouts .So in the coming months , with Iowa and New Hampshire behind them , expect Republicans on the campaign trail to kiss \" anchor babies \" and hope that Hispanics develop primary amnesia or stay home on Election Day .Republicans may get their wish , for Latinos have consistently punched below their weight in presidential contests .In 2012 , only 48 percent of eligible Latinos voted , a percentage very similar to their participation in recent elections .By contrast , 67 percent of eligible African Americans went to the polls that year , which meant that African - American voters outnumbered Latinos by almost 50 percent in the general election despite both groups having similar eligible voter figures .Hispanic potential voter numbers have skyrocketed in Nevada , Colorado and Texas , but in past elections their actual voting percentages in those states have trailed other groups , partly because of the high proportion of millennials among Hispanics .This November could see another anemic Hispanic turnout despite the immigration stance adopted by Republicans and reports from the National Center for Health Statistics that Latinos have benefited more than any group from the enactment of the Affordable Care Act , which every Republican candidate has pledged to repeal .Trump 's tirades are the price Hispanics pay for their voting apathy .In the months that remain of the presidential campaign expect Republicans to modulate their rhetoric and morph into Latino amigos .Whether Hispanics respond with payback for Iowa and New Hampshire , or instead dismiss Republican slights as mere campaign peccadillos , may determine not only the next president of the United States but whether Latinos will hear the same vitriol in future elections .To some extent this is true , but the Hispanic and American cultures do have their differences , so take the right steps to make things work .Family is a really big thing in Hispanic culture .Latino individuals are often very influenced by their family when it comes to who they date and for how long .This goes especially for Latino women , who traditionally would stay living in the home until the time came to move into the home of their new husband .This is n't really the norm for Hispanic families in America these days but it 's still indicative of the high value which Latin American culture places on family in the context of dating .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.38483"}

Jeremiah Wright , forcing Obama to deliver a much - heralded speech on race in Philadelphia .During his presidency , racial discussions have been largely limited to his reactions to unexpected public debates , such as the arrest of Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. and the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin .In theory , these two episodes offered opportunities for Obama to discuss reforms to the criminal justice system - an issue he 'd raised early in his campaign - but instead , he limited his response to tamping down potential racial conflicts , then quickly moving on .I take this complaint as one typical of the racially minded who can never be satisfied that America is talking enough about race - when the fact of the matter is they themselves can never shutup about race .But I saw all this coming back when Obama proved his charm to the American electorate years ago .All of his black politics were a fiction , and then he made all black politics into a fiction - both the traditional and the newly opportunistic .Because it was all about Barack Obama , not about any real continuation of ' The Struggle ' .Nevertheless , Obama played the right background music , gave fist bumps onstage and did those things that suited the styles of the revolutionaries and radicals .A suit he wore very well .I believe my characterization of him was ' Barbara Boxer in a black man suit ' , which is to say a typical Lefty American with no real loyalties but to the prerogatives of Left rhetoric as usual and win , win , win , elections .His agenda was indistinguishable from that of John Edwards basically until Shepard Fairy made the famous poster .And then he went on to raised more money in his campaign than any man in American history .And in several ways he has done so admirably .But some fraction of his black electorate has reason to be disappointed in themselves for following a racial line that turns out not to be the doctrine they were expecting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.20067"}

{"text": "The Rosenbergs and the Electric Chair .After Hiss , the next sensational American espionage trial was that of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg , a New York couple that had met in the Young Communist League in 1936 .In 1951 , the government charged the Rosenbergs with being involved in the spy ring that conveyed Klaus Fuchs 's atomic secrets to the Soviets .The prosecution 's star witness was Ethel Rosenberg 's brother , who admitted to his own role in the spy ring and turned state 's evidence to protect himself and his family ( though not his sister ) from execution .The prosecution had considerable evidence linking Julius Rosenberg to the spy ring , but very little on his wife .It seems that Ethel was charged mainly in order to put pressure on Julius to confess .He refused to do so , however , and in the end both Rosenbergs were convicted of violating the Espionage Act and sentenced to death .Failing to win a reprieve on appeal , the couple were executed via electric chair in June 1953 .Ethel Rosenberg became the first woman to suffer capital punishment in America since 1865 , when Mary Surratt was hanged for conspiring with John Wilkes Booth in Abraham Lincoln 's assassination .To many , the Rosenbergs ' executions - especially that of Ethel - seemed especially harsh when compared to the mere jail sentences given to higher - ranking spies like Alger Hiss and Klaus Fuchs .The Rosenbergs became martyrs to many on the left , who insisted upon their innocence and viewed their executions as proof of the dangerous hysteria of Cold War American society .Some also detected the foul scent of anti - Semitism in the harsh justice meted out to the Rosenbergs , who - unlike Hiss and Fuchs - were Jewish .But there seems to be little evidence to support that charge .Both the lead prosecutor and the judge in the Rosenberg case were themselves Jewish , and most mainstream American Jewish groups - fearing that the Rosenberg case would actually incite new anti - Semitism by associating Jews with Communism in the public mind - rejected the Rosenbergs ' claims of victimization and backed the prosecution .The American Jewish Committee went out of its way to send a friendly representative to HUAC to testify that \" Judaism and Communism are utterly incompatible . \" So if the Rosenbergs were victims , they were victims of their politics more than their religion or ethnicity .But the end of the Cold War after 1990 allowed historians to reassess the Rosenberg case by allowing access to long - secret Soviet archives .And we now know that Julius Rosenberg was certainly a Soviet spy , and that Ethel Rosenberg was privy to ( if not necessarily a participant in ) his espionage activities .Whether their actions merited the death penalty remains debatable , of course , but their claims of total innocence no longer seem credible to most historians .McCarthyism Reconsidered ?The release of Soviet documents in the wake of the USSR 's collapse has proven , undeniably , that a small number of American Communists were , in fact , spying for the Soviet Union .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.27327"}
