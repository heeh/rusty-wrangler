' \" Even after Howe was acquitted of the charges , government officials made comments to major media , dismissing Howe as a radical , mentally deranged , or both .To some extent the tactic has worked , but a former DOJ official said he is more convinced than ever Howe had good information .Solid in his book \" She 's solid in my book .I 'd like to meet her , \" he said about Howe and the intelligence she uncovered at Elohim City . \"The FBI knew about Strassmeir .He was reporting to the Germans To a tight circle of federal law enforcement officials she was known as Confidential Informant 53270 - 183 , or more commonly , CI-183 .During the trial of Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City bombing , she became more widely known in press accounts by her real name : Carol Elizabeth Howe .That is the name affixed to the ATF 's \" Informant Agreement \" of August 25 , 1994 , signed by Miss Howe and Special Agent Angela Finley ( now Angela Finley - Graham ) of the ATF 's Tulsa , Oklahoma office .McVeigh 's defense team had sought to have Howe testify concerning her allegations that she had warned her federal supervisors prior to the bombing that subjects of her investigation were planning to bomb federal buildings , including the one in Oklahoma City .But jurors in the Denver trial of McVeigh never heard Carol Howe 's name mentioned in court , nor did they hear her testimony .Federal prosecutors filed motions to prevent her appearance as a defense witness . \" Irrelevant \" Witness .U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch ruled for the prosecution in a May 27th decision that found Miss Howe 's testimony \" irrelevant \" to the McVeigh trial .At the time , Judge Matsch 's ruling was astounding , since the \" relevance \" of Howe 's testimony is facially obvious .It was federal prosecutors , after all , who had entered into evidence the records of a telephone debit card registered to Timothy McVeigh under the name \" Daryl Bridges . \"Among the calls listed was one placed two weeks before the bombing , at 1:46 p.m. on April 5th , to Elohim City , the main target of Howe 's undercover work .The intended recipient of that call was Andreas Strassmeir , whom Howe had identified before the bombing as one who was plotting to blow up federal buildings and carry out shootings , assassinations , and other acts of violence .Strassmeir has admitted in an affidavit to having met McVeigh at a gun show and having purchased materials from him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.416"}

Murrah building in downtown Oklahoma City on the morning of Wednesday , April 19 , 1995 .Also , according to recently released government documents , an individual experienced in loading large amounts of ammonia nitrate fertilizer into a vehicle for use as a terrorist truck bomb was present at the OKC scene and actually witnessed the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history .Records indicate that this ANFO explosives expert and his associates had constructed and destroyed at least eight vehicles in \" test bombing experiments \" out at a secret range in the New Mexico desert in the twelve months prior to the OKC bombing .He and his fellow explosives experts even photographed and videotaped these truck bombs as they detonated .This individual is , however , not a known associate of suspects Terry Lynn Nichols and Timothy James McVeigh or any so - called \" anti government militia \" in the United States .The \" vehicle bomb expert , \" Special Agent Harry Everhart , is an employee of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.10321"}
