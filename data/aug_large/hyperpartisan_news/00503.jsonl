Bush administration seeking to continue a warrantless wiretapping program , putting his job on the line to do so .When a reporter asked him if he did n't have a duty to support President Bush , Comey answered \" No , my responsibility , I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States .\" Obama proudly cited that independent streak when he announced Comey 's appointment .If the FBI discovers evidence of wrong - doing - and there are many reasons to think they will - Comey will not sit on the findings .The FBI does not indict ; that is up to the Justice Department .But , if the FBI makes a recommendation to indict , and Justice ignores the report , rumor is the FBI could make public the incriminating material .Either way , Hillary Clinton 's political ambitions are toast .Related : Why Every Candidate in the 2016 Race Should Fear Mike Bloomberg .The inquiry began by looking into whether Clinton 's use of a personal email server violated security standards ; it has since been expanded twice .As reported by Judge Andrew Napolitano of Fox News , Clinton signed an oath promising to comply with the laws protecting national security information , violations that the Obama administration has aggressively prosecuted .As Napolitano says , \" The Obama Department of Justice prosecuted a young sailor for espionage for sending a selfie to his girlfriend , because in the background of the photo was a view of a sonar screen on a submarine ....It also prosecuted Gen. David Petraeus for espionage for keeping secret and top - secret documents in an unlocked drawer in his desk inside his guarded home .It alleged that he shared those secrets with a friend who also had a security clearance , but it dropped those charges . \"Napolitano contends that the bar for prosecution is low , and can be based on negligence .That is , the government need not prove that Clinton intended to reveal state secrets - only that she did so through carelessness .SAP information can include the names of intelligence assets , for instance , and other highly sensitive information .To date , some 1,340 \" classified \" emails have been discovered amongst those stored on Clinton 's server .Clinton argues that those communications were not so designated at the time .Undermining her defense is a series of emails exchanged with aide Jake Sullivan in which she appears to order him to get around security protocol and simply cut and paste sensitive information to be faxed to her .The compromising communication was amongst those released in a recent Friday night \" dump .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.271416"}

Wilson IV , was a C.I.A. employee .Mr. Wilson was a critic of the administration 's Iraq policies .The official said that the option of recusal or referral to a special prosecutor remained \" wide open .\"The official said that the question of whether Mr. Ashcroft should step aside had been discussed among Mr. Ashcroft 's senior advisers , but that so far none of the career lawyers on the case had recommended that the attorney general remove himself .The official said Mr. Ashcroft had twice gathered his investigative team to urge them to find out who had leaked the identity of the C.I.A. operative and to prosecute that person if possible . \"He 's angry about this , \" the official said .But Mr. Ashcroft faces the same political and legal dilemma that haunted his predecessors when the Justice Department has been forced to examine the conduct of senior officials in the White House or the Cabinet .Janet Reno was forced to turn to independent counsels seven times in her nearly eight - year tenure at the department .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.440796"}

Armitage , Mr. Comey 's standing in the White House declined after he challenged some positions championed by Mr. Cheney .But also like them , Mr. Comey ultimately chose not to resign and , while he unquestionably had some influence , he did not fundamentally shift the administration 's policies .At this week 's hearing , Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , compared the hospital standoff between Mr. Comey with Mr. Card and Mr. Gonzales to the so - called Saturday night massacre in the Nixon administration .At the height of the Watergate scandal , the attorney general , Elliot L. Richardson , and his deputy , William D. Ruckelshaus , resigned rather than follow Richard M. Nixon 's order to fire the Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox .But there is a difference .By his own account , Mr. Comey threatened to quit -- along with Mr. Ashcroft and the F.B.I. director , Robert S. Mueller III -- but never did .Mr. Bush allowed new procedures in the N.S.A. program , which officials have said included Justice Department audits , and the eavesdropping continued without the court warrants some legal authorities believe the law requires .Former colleagues say strains with the White House began after the arrival in 2003 of Jack L. Goldsmith to head the department 's Office of Legal Counsel .With Mr. Comey 's backing , Mr. Goldsmith questioned what he considered shaky legal reasoning in several crucial opinions , including some drafted by Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo .Mr. Goldsmith 's review of legal memoranda on the N.S.A. program and interrogation practices became a source of friction between Mr. Comey and the White House .He had a strong sense of personal integrity and he felt that the legal judgments of the Justice Department were not being honored , ' ' a former Justice Department colleague said , speaking on condition of anonymity .Mr. Yoo had the strong support of Mr. Gonzales and David S. Addington , Mr. Cheney 's legal adviser .Mr. Comey testified that both Mr. Cheney and Mr. Addington opposed the N.S.A. program changes sought by the Justice Department .A graduate of William and Mary and the University of Chicago law school , Mr. Comey was a federal prosecutor in New York from 1987 to 1993 and in the Eastern District of Virginia from 1996 to 2001 .His bringing of an indictment in the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia , which killed 19 American service members , brought him to the attention of the Bush White House .In 2002 , Mr. Bush appointed him United States attorney in the Southern District of New York , where he oversaw the prosecution of more terror cases as well as several high - profile fraud and securities crimes , including the insider trading investigation of Martha Stewart .He was confirmed as deputy attorney general in December 2003 , under Mr. Ashcroft and stayed on after Mr. Gonzales arrived in January 2005 , but friends say he soon began talking about plans to leave .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.35745"}

Powell and his deputy , Richard L. Armitage , Mr. Comey 's standing in the White House declined after he challenged some positions championed by Mr. Cheney .But also like them , Mr. Comey ultimately chose not to resign and , while he unquestionably had some influence , he did not fundamentally shift the administration 's policies .At this week 's hearing , Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , compared the hospital standoff between Mr. Comey with Mr. Card and Mr. Gonzales to the so - called Saturday night massacre in the Nixon administration .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.87489"}

Comey Jr. , a former Manhattan prosecutor who was installed just three weeks ago as deputy attorney general , will oversee the investigation following Mr. Ashcroft 's withdrawal .His first decision in that role was to name Patrick J. Fitzgerald , who is the United States attorney in Chicago and is a friend and former colleague of Mr. Comey 's , as a special counsel who will direct the investigation .I agree with that judgment .And I also agree that he made it at the appropriate time , the appropriate point in this investigation . ' ' Mr. Comey added that the attorney general did not believe that he had a conflict of interest that would have prevented him from fairly overseeing the case .

{"text": "Ronald Reagan 's party suffered a thrashing in the 1982 mid - terms elections , and his approval rating dropped steadily below 40 % in 1983 thanks to the recession his policies brought on .But the economy recovered , and so did Reagan 's approval ratings , which jumped substantially and allowed him to win re - election in a landslide .Obama has several advantages going into 2012 .His approval ratings have never sunk to Reagan 's lows , and unlike with Reagan , it is irrational for voters to blame Obama for a recession that began more than a year before he took office as president .Most polls indicate that Americans tend to blame Bush more than Obama for the recession , although Wall Street and Congress also take the blame .Much like Reagan , Obama remains personally popular despite the economic mess he inherited .And even the high unemployment rate under Obama never reached the levels it did under Reagan , although the Bush recession was much more severe and long - lasting than Reagan 's recession .It is almost certain that the economy will improve by 2012 , and it probably will improve a lot .Although some economists fear that we are in a period of long - term stagnation , the reality is that unemployment has already peaked , the GNP has been growing , albeit too slowly , for a year , and the economy is almost certain to get better .This is a natural consequence of what happens after a recession , but someone will get the credit for it .A compromise with the Republicans will mean that Republicans will be able to claim credit for economic growth .Keeping the course will mean Obama and the Democrats get the credit .In 1996 , Bill Clinton followed the guidance of his Machiavellian advisor Dick Morris and used a strategy of triangulation , shifting hard to the right on many policies and effectively abandoning many Democrats in Congress .But what ultimately succeeded for Clinton was not triangulation , but hardball politics .When Newt Gingrich and the Republicans sought to shut down the federal government , Clinton stood up against them rather than compromising .And what proved to be the most successful thing for Clinton ( and is the main reason for Clinton 's enduring popularity today despite various scandals ) was the incredible growth of the economy in the 1990s .The 2010 elections were far worse than I had expected a year ago , but that 's solely because the Bush recession was worse than almost anyone had imagined .It 's all about the economy .Refusing to compromise on policy does n't mean Obama should speak out publicly against the concept .Getting rid of earmarks , as Obama suggested in his press conference , is a great example of where Obama can push for progressive reform while appearing to compromise with the Republicans who pretend to oppose earmarks .The reality is that nothing important will get done in the next two years under a Republican House and a Democratic Senate .Obama needs to get whatever important legislation he wants passed in December , including an extension of the tax cuts for the middle class .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.74733"}

Mueller III , operate as major members of Mr. Bush 's antiterror team , a closeness that complicates a criminal inquiry at the White House managed by Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Mueller .Several alternative approaches have been suggested both inside and outside the Justice Department , the officials said .In one approach , Mr. Ashcroft would recuse himself from the case once James B. Comey , the federal prosecutor in Manhattan , took over as deputy attorney general in either an acting or permanent basis .Mr. Bush said earlier this month that he intended to appoint Mr. Comey as deputy attorney general .Mr. Comey brings established prosecutorial credentials to the job .If Mr. Comey took charge , it would avoid the time - consuming prospect of appointing a special counsel who would then have semi - independence to investigate the case , but would still be answerable to the attorney general .Mr. Ashcroft is aware of the political sensitivity of the case , and aides said he had worked hard to ensure an aggressive investigation .After a news report indicated that the F.B.I. would move cautiously because of the intense scrutiny , an angry Mr. Ashcroft had an aide call the F.B.I. immediately to let officials there know that that would not be the case , a Justice Department adviser said . \"He wants to make certain we 're moving with all appropriate dispatch . \"Mr. Ashcroft and Alberto R. Gonzales , the White House counsel , have also been under fire for their initial handling of the case .The Justice Department allowed the White House to wait overnight on Sept. 28 before sending an electronic message ordering White House employees not to destroy records related to the leak .Ashley Snee , a spokesman for Mr. Gonzales , said he believed the delay was acceptable because no one in the White House had any idea there was an investigation .But The New York Times and The Washington Post had reported the day before that the C.I.A. had forwarded the matter to the Justice Department for possible investigation .Yesterday , I called the testimony of James Comey before the Senate Judiciary Committee \" disturbing . \"Although I did n't link to it , I was influenced by this NPR report that I 'd heard in my car .And I really must confess that I struggle on a daily basis with the powerful emotional tendrils that spiral out of NPR and twine around my brain cells !So let 's seek out some counterbalance today .Here 's John Hinderaker 's defense of the Bush administration .You simply must read the whole thing , because Hinderaker explains an elaborate time line and puts Comey 's testimony in context in a way that is not susceptible to excerpting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.13695"}

'And I do n't know .He 's not a native Hawaiian .Where was he born ?I do n't know .Supposedly Hawaii , but we do n't have independent confirmation of it . \"In July 2009 , Limbaugh was still endorsing the birther movement by referring to Obama as having \" no birth certificate .\" Limbaugh was leery of announcing that Obama had been born in Kenya , but his tacit endorsement of the birthers was still clear .WorldNetDaily editor - in - chief Joseph Farah ( ghostwriter of Limbaugh 's second book , and leader of a campaign to put up \" Where 's the Birth Certificate ? \" billboards around the country ) noted the importance of Limbaugh 's stand with the birthers : \" What that did is beyond Rush 's impact .It also gives other talk show hosts license to talk about this issue .... Rush is kind of the standard of talk show hosts .A lot of people emulate what he does .He crossed the Rubicon on that show , and I 'm very proud of him for doing it .\" Now , Limbaugh has finally taken the further step to confess openly that he 's a birther , something that he probably was all along but simply was too cowardly to admit .The man who gave Limbaugh the courage to come out of the birther closet was Donald Trump .Rush spoke with great admiration of his fellow birther : \" Donald Trump is providing a lesson on how to beat Barack Obama .Donald Trump is showing that the way to do that is you go after these people .\" Limbaugh 's willingness to admit his birther beliefs reflects the radical transformation of the Republican Party that Limbaugh himself led .Limbaugh has spawned a new generation of conspiracy nuts who have been so dumbed down by years of being Dittoheads that even plainly idiotic ideas like those of the birthers have become the mainstream of the conservative movement .And now Rush Limbaugh feels the need to lurch even further to the right in order to maintain his status as the leader of the lunatics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.70598"}

{"text": "I completely agree with Steve T 's post above , and I would like to add and clarify a few things .First of all , I understand that given a large enough sample size , the overall probabilites of specific hands will line up relatively close to what one would see in real life .Sites have been audited on this general premise , and they are deemed ' fair ' if the long - term variance is low enough .Of course the sites could get in trouble to some extent if they are not deemed ' fair ' .What they are not taking into account is the fact that the long - term is comprised of a multitude of adjacent short - terms that can easily be manipulated on several levels and for several reasons .Now I have a life and have not mustered the time nor the energy to run analyses based on these criteria , but I encourage anyone who cares enough to try gathering a long - term database of hands GIVEN certain conditions , such as : . 3 ) 50,000 + hands in heads up situations in which the aggressor is the underdog in each hand vs. 50,000 + hands in which the underdog is passively calling .These are three conditions that come to mind ; I 'm sure there are many more that could be tested .# 2 sounds a bit paranoid I suppose , but it 's worth testing anyway .Let me state clearly that with regard to # 3 above , I fully understand the concept of semibluffing , and this is not at all what I am referring to .I realize that aggressive players often get paid off by making keen semibluffs ; a tight opponent may get out of the hand and the aggressor takes it down right then and there .If the opponent does call , the bluffer has at least given himself an opportunity to get lucky and hit what he needs .This is just semibluffing in a nutshell and I 'm sure you all know this already .For example , let 's say hypothetically that a particular draw has a 28 % chance of hitting .After 100,000 hands of situations in which the semibluffer comes over the top and is called to see a showdown , the semibluffer wins 36 % of the time .This discrepancy over this many hands would be statistically significant .HOWEVER , all the site would have to do is to be sure that given the same 28 % likelihood of hitting the draw , a passive caller on that same draw would hit a mere 20 % of the time .And this is of course assuming that there are just as many passive callers as there are semibluffers .The point is that these billion - dollar industries could easily pay to hire the best programmers in the world who are willing to sacrifice their morality for huge paychecks .They know what conditions are more profitable on the site 's behalf and then could easily trigger the software to favor those conditions , not the players themselves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.226715"}
