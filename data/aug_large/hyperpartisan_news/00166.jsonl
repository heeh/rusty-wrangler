Cupp defend Ann Coulter 's scheduled appearance at the \" Homocon \" pro - gay rights conference in September , new evidence about the destructive nature of the homosexual lifestyle has surfaced in the treason case of gay soldier Bradley Manning .Information developed by CNN suggests that Manning , who may have been considering a sex change , had been cruising the homosexual subculture for several years , under the noses of his military superiors , and even went to gay bars .All of this constitutes a blatant violation of the \" Do n't ask , Do n't tell , \" homosexual exclusion policy that President Obama has promised to overturn .Ignoring the national security implications of the sensational case , S.E. Cupp , an occasional guest on the Fox News Channel , tells Matt Lewis of Politics Daily that \" Conservatism and gay rights are actually natural allies .\" She is , ironically , the author of a book , Losing Our Religion , on how \" Judeo - Christian values \" are in danger of being \" relegated to the hush - hush subculture unable to operate in the open without fear of retribution and censorship . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.485794"}
