{"text": "Of course , no system is perfect and it is not uncommon for laws enacted via traditional legislative methods to be declared unconstitutional .There are also concerns about the economic and fiscal effects of the initiative process .Research by John Matsusaka examined the economic and fiscal effects of the initiative process by comparing states that have it and those who do not .He concludes that states with the initiative process have lower combined state and local government spending than the non - initiative states and the spending in the initiative states is systematically decentralized .Local government spending is higher and state government spending is lower in the initiative states .It is clear that when given the initiative , voters have a preference for spending decisions to be made close to home .He found evidence that indicates initiative states tend to raise more revenue by charging those who utilize the government services .Matsusaka also concludes that initiative states with lower petition signature requirements have a greater difference in fiscal outcomes with the purely representative states .( Matsusaka ) .In 2001 S. Brock Bloomberg expanded Matsusaka 's work to consider if voters used statewide initiatives to allocate government resources in a more productive manner .He discovered that initiatives can lead state to more efficient economies , with findings to suggest that states with initiatives waste between 20 - 30 percent fewer resources .He also discovered that initiatives accelerate economic convergence by about a third .( Bloomberg ) .Another concern is the effect of direct democracy upon minorities .Many in Alabama , with a large African - American population and a history of racial discrimination , should be especially concerned about the effect of the initiative process upon rights of minorities .This concern seems ironic when placed in the historical context that during the early 1900 's a primary motive of the ruling class opposition to initiatives in the East and South was to keep minorities disenfranchised .It was Alexander Hamilton 's argument that tyrannical tendencies of the majority could be controlled by \" enlargement of the orbit \" ( Hamilton ) , or spreading the process over a large geographical territory .The argument in favor of spreading the initiative process over a large geographical area to protect minorities was reinforced by a study conducted by Todd Donovan and Shaun Bowler in 1998 .The results strongly suggest that initiative states are not likely to pass legislation adverse to minority groups and that adverse initiatives are more likely to occur on the local level .In a study conducted for the Public Policy Institute of California , Zolton Hajnal and Hugh Louch concluded that in California initiative votes over the past 20 years where nonwhite voters indicate a clear preference , they voted on the prevailing side 59 % of the time .A statewide survey conducted in January 2000 by Mark Baldassare for the Public Policy Institute asked if citizen 's initiatives or the governor / legislature were the best way to address California 's problems .Responses to the poll question indicated that 76 % of Whites , 73 % of Asians , 83 % of Latinos , and 92 % of African Americans preferred citizen 's initiatives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.9274"}

Braymer , RailPAC President - Things can be confusing with all the political battles being fought over the California State budget .The budget proposed by the Governor keeps in place the current level of subsidy for Rail Operations .This means no cuts can be expected for state - supported rail services if the Governor 's budget is passed .In fact , plans are going ahead under the current budget to add a second daily service between Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo on the PACIFIC SURFLINER with connecting buses to the Bay Area .That 's the Good News .So now we turn to the bad news .To try to balance the budget the administration is planning to divert $ 1.1 Billion from transportation spending in fiscal year 2004 - 2005 to the general fund .There is close to a $ 12.3 Billion budget shortfall in a $ 99 Billion State budget .The diverted money is collected from gasoline taxes approved by the voters under Proposition 42 to be earmarked only for transportation uses , both road and rail .Over the next six years at least $ 3.4 Billion in transportation spending is planned to be diverted .There is a clause in Proposition 42 that the money can be diverted during a fiscal emergency , and these actions would mean years of delay for transportation construction projects already years in the planning .The hope is this will be temporary .But , like all political promises there are no guarantees .Part of the irony of this situation is during the recent election much was made of how California receives back from the Federal Government only about 75 cents out of each dollar Californians pays in Federal Taxes .Yet many transportation projects receive Federal grants with a local and State participation as a requirement for Federal support .Many projects are at risk of losing Federal funding if the State does n't come up with its share .The result would be the State losing more money in lost Federal grants than it saves from reduced State spending .An example of this is the SPRINTER diesel light rail service ready to begin construction this year between Oceanside and Escondido .Of the $ 352 Million budgeted for this project , $ 152 Million comes from Federal financing .The State is planning to cut off $ 80 million from its share of the project .The North County Transit District is planning to go ahead with the project , however , borrowing money if need be to keep the project on track .The business community which usually supports reductions in Government spending is beginning to realize that cutbacks in State spending means loss of business since the State is a major consumer of goods and services .Increased fees are also hitting many businesses , which have to pay these new fees to do business .Transportation is a major factor in economic growth .California now rank 's 40th among the states in overall infrastructure investment based on personal income .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.70441"}

{"text": "An editorial in the New York Times addresses the gap in labor protections for these workers - a gap which has been there since the 1930s , when federal labor protections were created .In my field of workers compensation , many states still do not have their workers comp systems cover farm workers .The editorial : .Farm Workers ' Rights , 70 Years Overdue Published : April 5 , 2009 .It is more than bank failures and rising unemployment that give these troubled times echoes of the 1930s .An unfinished labor battle from the New Deal is being waged again .The goal is to win basic rights that farm and domestic workers were denied more than 70 years ago , when the Roosevelt administration won major reforms protecting other workers in areas like overtime and disability pay , days of rest and union organizing .That inequality is a perverse holdover from the Jim Crow era .Segregationist Southern Democrats in Congress could not abide giving African - Americans , who then made up most of the farm and domestic labor force , an equal footing in the workplace with whites .President Roosevelt 's compromise simply wrote workers in those industries out of the New Deal .They were thus sidelined from the labor movement , with predictable results .Though the Dixiecrats have all long since died or repented , the injustice they spawned has never been corrected .Poverty , brutal working conditions and legally sanctioned discrimination persist for new generations of laborers , who are now mostly Latino immigrants .In New York , advocates are pressing for passage of the Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act , which would give these workers the rights that others have long taken for granted , as well as seek badly needed improvements in safety and sanitary conditions in the fields .Domestic workers , meanwhile , are seeking a \" Bill of Rights \" in Albany covering things like overtime pay , cost - of - living raises and health benefits .A separate effort begun last week seeks to end these stubbornly lingering injustices for workers in all states by fixing federal law .It was announced on Cesar Chavez 's birthday by old lions of his movement , including Jerry Cohen , who as general counsel of the United Farm Workers helped win passage of a landmark 1975 California law that secured unprecedented rights for the state 's farm workers .The campaign has been joined by a growing number of labor groups and immigrant advocates , like Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles and the Farm Labor Organizing Committee , which represents migrant workers in the Midwest and North Carolina .In both campaigns , advocates are counting on a changed political landscape to help their cause .But even with Democrats controlling the New York Legislature , the farm worker bill has languished .It faces fierce opposition from growers and has been eclipsed by the entropy and fiscal crises of Gov. David Paterson 's Albany .In Washington , labor advocates are preoccupied by different battles , like the fight for the pro - union Employee Free Choice Act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.925644"}

{"text": "The U.S. Supreme Court has n't accepted a ballot access case brought by a minor party or independent candidate since 1991 , when it heard an Illinois case and ruled against the state .However , the Court has recently shown that it is thinking about taking Ralph Nader 's ballot access case from Hawaii .On January 31 , the Court asked Hawaii to respond to Nader 's cert petition .This probably means that there is a 25 % chance the Court will hear the case .Hawaii 's response is due March 4 , and the Court will then decide whether to accept the case .Nader sued Hawaii in 2004 , after Hawaii rejected Nader 's independent presidential petition .Nader had submitted twice as many signatures as were required .Hawaii has very stringent petition - checking procedures , and wants either the signer 's birthday , or the last four digits of the Social Security number , or the state wo n't accept the signature .Also if the voter has bad handwriting , the state will not make much of an effort to read the handwriting .Nader needed 3,711 signatures , which was 1 % of the last presidential vote cast , and the state said he did n't have enough valid signatures .Nader challenged the state 's law , both on its petition - checking procedures , and also he challenged the law on the basis that an entire new party only needed 677 valid signatures .In Hawaii , when a new party gets on the ballot , it is given its own primary , and its members can get on the primary ballot with only 15 or 25 signatures ( depending on the office ) , and any registered voter can sign .It is therefore easy for a new party to \" flood the ballot \" with a nominee for every partisan office in the state , which makes a big impact on the number of candidates on the ballot .Nader argued that it is irrational for the state to require six times as many signatures for a single independent presidential candidate , as it requires for an entire new party .The U.S. District Court and the 9 th circuit rejected all of Nader 's arguments , so he asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case , on the point about the irrationality of the number of signatures required .No independent presidential petition has succeeded in Hawaii since 2000 .In 2008 , when Nader was again an independent candidate , he created the \" Independent Party \" in Hawaii in 2008 , so as to get on the ballot with a much lower number of signatures .That worked , but does n't excuse the state 's irrational law .In 1974 the U.S. Supreme Court had said that states must have constitutional procedures for both independent candiates , and new parties .One set of procedures ca n't substitute for the other .On February 17 , a new lawsuit was filed against one particular aspect of California 's new \" top - two \" election system , passed by the voters in June 2010 as Proposition 14 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.37459"}

Anderson was entitled to block the use of his ballot label , \" Anderson Coalition \" by any other candidates in Connecticut .The other is Baer v Meyer , a 10 th circuit decision from Colorado won in 1984 by the Libertarian and Citizens Parties .The First Circuit decision also does not mention the U.S. Supreme Court decision California Democratic Party v Jones , which has language supporting name protection for political parties .The First Circuit also believed an affidavit signed by David Scanlan , Deputy Secretary of State , who said that if the party had submitted a party petition , the party would have been given its own party column .That would have helped the problem , because if the party had its own party column , Barr would have been listed in that party column .Even though Phillies would have been on the ballot as a Libertarian , Phillies would have been in the independent column , which would have at least hinted to voters that Barr was the nominee .However , the only time any group ever did the party petition in New Hampshire was in 2000 .That year , the Libertarian Party did that petition , but it still was n't given a party column !The First Circuit also did not permit an oral argument .The party has 90 days to decide whether to ask for U.S. Supreme Court review .The First Circuit appears prejudiced against minor parties .A few months ago it became the first court to deny parties the ability to use a stand - in presidential candidate on a petition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.96324"}

Martin O'Malley signed the bill about a week ago , and it is slated to take effect July 1 .A successful petition drive would halt the bill , putting it in limbo until Maryland voters get a chance to weigh in at the polls in November 2012 .Talking Points Corner : To read Casa 's take on the in - state tuition legislation , check out the group 's website .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.05472"}
