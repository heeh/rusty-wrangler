'This is exactly the argument that Tory MPs campaigning in the European elections found on the doorstep .Voters told them that they liked what David Cameron had to say now about Europe and they liked the idea of a renegotiation .But they felt that voting Ukip would strengthen Cameron 's hand because it would give Brussels an awful fright at the prospect of Brexit .The question is whether the Conservatives can convince those Ukip voters to return in 2015 .It 's interesting that Major chose to be charitably complimentary about Cameron 's chances of securing a good settlement in the renegotiation , even though the Prime Minister has failed to take his predecessor 's advice about appointing someone to work full time on the matter .Cameron is on the brink of appointing someone to an influential job that will play an important role in that renegotiation , but as I say in my Telegraph column today , his apparent preferred choice of Andrew Lansley is n't going down all that well with Tory MPs .They fear Lansley is n't the strong player that Cameron needs when he 's got a very tough few years of talks with reluctant EU leaders ahead of him .He wo n't want to rely on the fright of Ukip , after all .Augustus .As far as I 'm concerned the less EU circus the better .Why have expensive permanent parliaments in two places for starters ?And hand a lot of those powers back to the nation states where they belong .And away with all that luxury in Brussels at taxpayers ' expense : unnecessary travels to Strasbourg ; 5-star ego trips around the world ; garages full of expensive Mercedes with drivers ready for every trifling little trip .Apart from Nigel Farage nobody seems to care .Why not ?rtj1211 .Major is simply not being a back seat driver , something Thatcher was completely incapable of resisting .His role as a former Primer Minister is to provide advice behind the scenes if requested , but not to undermine the current incumbent in public .Smithersjones2013 .Yeah ,yeahyeah .This is just Tory has beens spinning their heads off and circling the wagons around Cameron after the disaster of a Euros which saw them beaten in heartland after heartland .The simple reality is that if Cameron loses the general election then all the referendum talk goes away and Brussels knows this .SO they are just waiting until Cameron bites the dust and then the EPP , Socialists , Liberals and greens will carry on regardless toward ' ever closer union ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.313053"}

'( 3 )The report made under subsection ( 2 ) shall be laid before Parliament for its approval . ' - ( Mr David . )In calling for a referendum on Greece 's bailout plan , Prime Minister George Papandreou has , it could be said , embraced one of his country 's oldest political traditions : direct democracy .The idea that the citizens of a state should all cast votes to decide matters of common interest was arguably born within an easy walk of his Athens office , some two and a half millennia ago .Of course , referendums have remained a part of democratic politics into the modern era , with a formal place in the constitutions of many countries and regions , from France to Australia .In the United States , their use goes back to the town meetings of colonial New England , and they still have a crucial role in the politics of several states , notably California .But the use of referendums as a political procedure has always been tense , even problematic , for democracies - and that is no less true of Greece 's planned vote in January .Papandreou says he is paying deference to the unmediated will of the Greek people , and so presents the vote as the very essence of democracy .Yet in fact , referendums have most often done more to weaken democratic institutions than to strengthen them , and this new example is no exception .THE STORY BEGINS with a wholly obvious point : Modern states are far too large and complex for direct democracy .Since it would be hugely impractical for the people , as a whole , to decide on everything from the size of foreign aid budgets to new environmental regulations , they delegate the business of government to elected representatives .We tend to forget , however , how very strange and unnatural this practice once seemed .Why should voters trust an ever - changing group of people , most of whom they themselves have not elected , most of whom they have never met , and with whom they may have nothing in common , to make decisions on matters that intimately affect their livelihood ?Surely it makes much more sense ( it was once thought ) to entrust government to people you are bound to through ties of family , or class , or caste , or whom you believe God has chosen to rule .As late as the eighteenth century , some prominent political philosophers rejected the very principle of representative government .Jean - Jacques Rousseau , for instance , mocked the English for believing that an elected parliament made them free .They were free only at the actual moment they voted , he insisted .As soon as they surrendered their political authority to their representatives , they lapsed into a state of slavery .Even in the midst of democratic revolutions , representative democracy remained an object of massive criticism and suspicion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.311516"}

{"text": "To repeat my comment on that on the last thread , which I hope JR will permit : .Thanks .Continued from post above : excerpt from Spinelli MEP group proposals for a new EU treaty , called \" A Fundamental Law of the European Union \" .It also elevates into the provisions on enlargement the critical Copenhagen criteria on good governance which must apply to candidate states .There are two further reforms of major constitutional importance which make the Fundamental Law stand out from previous efforts at treaty revision .The first concerns the method of future treaty change .Here , we keep the method of the Convention , in which decisions are reached by consensus .But we modify the procedure for the Intergovernmental Conference to allow amendments to be agreed by three quarters of the states .The European Parliament gains the right of assent to treaty changes .Any future new treaty will enter into force either once ratified by four fifths of the states representing a majority of the EU population or , if carried in a pan - EU referendum , by a simple majority .This less rigid approach to constitutional amendment will bring the EU into line with all other international organisations and federal states , and help to avoid situations in which one recalcitrant state can take the rest hostage .The second important constitutional change flows directly from the first .EU states can not be forced against their will to take the federal step .At the same time , such states can not be allowed an open - ended possibility to pick and choose what they want from the EU and discard the rest .The point has been reached when yet more \u00e0 la carte opt - outs and derogations risk fracturing the cohesion of the acquis communautaire .Free - riding means disintegration .The Fundamental Law creates a new category of associate membership for any member state which chooses not to join the more federal union .Each associate state would negotiate its own arrangement with the core states .Rights and duties would have to be clear .Institutional participation would necessarily be limited .Continued allegiance to the Union 's values would be required , but political engagement in the Union 's objectives would be reduced .Associate membership could cater for the needs of Norway , Iceland and Switzerland , seeking to improve on their present unsatisfactory arrangements .Other countries , notably Turkey , choosing not to join the EU but desiring and deserving a permanent , structured relationship with it , might find associate membership to be a credible lasting settlement .Such are the main features of the Fundamental Law , a new constitutional treaty which will strengthen the governance and cohesion of the Union and bolster democratic confidence in our common endeavour to build a better Europe .With respect John , politicians are deluding themselves if they think UKIP 's chances of winning seats in the 2015 election are no different to their chances in 2010 .Since the last election , it has become apparent that the real Conservatives are now UKIP which is why we ex - Tories are turning to them in our droves and why they will do so well in 2015 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.2218"}

Smith , and that is what my amendment would do .This was omitted from the original explanatory notes and is now included in the Government 's reply to the Committee , which is surprising .For too long , we have witnessed further seamless and ceaseless integration and it is time we took a stand , removing ambiguity , uncertainty and the gradual absorption of the EU into our own constitutional DNA -that is the point .This is about not just the European Court but our constitutional law , of which Parliament is an integral part .On compliance with international obligations being obligatory if we were expressly to legislate inconsistently with the 1972 Act or with legislation made under it , the Minister for Europe has stated on several occasions that he does not regard it as a matter of policy .I must emphatically refute that assertion as being entirely inconsistent with the legislative supremacy of Parliament and its sovereignty .That was clearly stated in Mortensen v. Peters in which it was held that the courts may not hold an Act void on the ground that it contravenes general principles of international law .Let me mention Mr MacShane at this stage as he raised this question .Furthermore , the courts may not hold an Act invalid because it conflicts with a treaty to which the United Kingdom is a party .Statute is superior to prerogative in law and any treaties or legislation flowing from those treaties , even within legislation passed under the 1972 Act , is subject to parliamentary sovereignty and to repeal .That includes repatriation , which has been specifically rejected by the Deputy Prime Minister .Furthermore , if we were to do that , we could not allow the judiciary flagrantly to contradict Acts of Parliament .That has never been accepted in our constitutional law , and the vagueness of clause 18 is , in the words of one of the distinguished witnesses , \" an invitation to litigate \" .The uncertainty and ambiguity that would arise as a result of the need for interpretation would invite that part of the judiciary that does not accept the traditional view of parliamentary sovereignty to prevail .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.28569"}

Sarkozy as angry and resentful ?It does n't .So which is right ?Let me quote here from a report in Monday 's ' Independent ' by John Lichfield , that paper 's experienced Paris correspondent .Mr Lichfield reported that ' Britain 's self - imposed isolation from EU treaty reform talks is a ' blessing ' for other EU Nations , one of President Nicolas Sarkozy 's leading advisers said at the weekend ' .He quoted Jean - David Levitte , the President 's chief diplomatic aide , as saying that Britain 's split from the rest of the EU 27 , though ' regrettable ' , would ' make future negotiations on a fiscal union to save the euro much simpler ' .It could therefore be seen as a \" benediction \" or \" blessing \" .It would ' short - circuit the need for laborious negotiation with Britain on a formal EU treaty .It would therefore make it possible for the other 26 EU countries to reach a looser \" inter - governmental \" agreement by March . 'That 's what Mr Lichfield says .I would add that probably this is what President Sarkozy wanted all along .Did British diplomats in Brussels know this ?If not , why not ?If they did know it , did they tell Mr Cameron ?If not , why not ?If so , when ?If they did tell Mr Cameron , then does he really think his action was as bold and courageous as his marketing men have told the media it was ?I only ask , because I have been reporting on negotiations since 1977 , when I was a labour correspondent in the lost days of union militancy , and am much too old and leathery to believe what I am told at the post - negotiation press briefings .There is , I 'm sorry to say , a sort of convention that those who lose in negotiations ( especially if they have to sell the deal to members or voters ) are allowed by the victors to pretend to have won .After all , if you really have won , you can easily put up with the other guy claiming to have done so .In this case , many Labour politicians had hoped that their party would lose the by - election , so as to give them the pretext to mount a putsch against their hopeless leader , Michael Foot , just in time for the fast - approaching general election .The stocks were sold , the press was squared , the middle class were all prepared and then , dang it , the Labour candidate went and won .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.24548"}

{"text": "I think requiring a referendum is a bad idea , tactically .Rich is right .One solution is to repeal ( or amend ) the entrenchment clause ( which can be done with a simple majority ) .There may be some argument that this is constitutionally improper ( because the entrenchment has signalled that it 's a significant constitutional issue , so legitimacy may call for a bigger majority than usual to change it ) , but it would be within Parliament 's powers .Parliament is not above ignoring constitutional conventions anyway : witness the recent passage of the Supreme Court Act , without referendum , by a narrow majority .Rich : sure , they could do that - parliament used single entrenchment for a reason .But as someone who takes entrenchment seriously ( and wants to see a bit more of it - for example to protect MMP from wreckers like Winston Peters ) , I 'd prefer that Parliament respected the spirit of the thing .There 's no constitutional convention or legal requirement for a referendum .Parliament is sovereign and can not , as has been pointed out , bind its successors .Entrenchment is nothing more than an exortation for future parliaments to think twice .Perhaps entrenchment should be something more than that , but currently it does n't really have the prerequisite public awareness to have that form of legitimacy .The only reason we hear so much about referendums is that it 's a lazy way to attack a bill that does n't have strong popular support , to holler \" you need a referendum \" .I seem to recall Brash actually promising , albeit informally , to hold referendums for all bills that did n't command a lead in the polls .I found the idea of National holding a referendum on tax cuts laughable , and I doubt he would have stuck to it .So , I stand by my point , calling for a referendum is the political equivalent of crack , a cheap hit that proves nothing .Daedalus : while Parliament purports to be sovereign , and could easily make the required changes by first amending s268 , I do n't think this is something we should be encouraging them to do .I want politicians to respect the spirit of our constitution , not just its form - otherwise we get the sort of game - playing attitude towards it that you see inthe US , with disastrous consequences .So , we have to take the entrenchment at face value .And as a 75 % majority is unlikely , that means a referendum .As I said , this is morally unpalatable - but if the aim is to provoke a public debate , then it is an excellent way of doing it .Really ?It seems a bit wimpy to surrender before you 've even begun to fight - and while any campaign to lower the voting age to 18 would require a hell of a lot of careful work and would n't happen overnight , it could happen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.981735"}

{"text": "Ministry of Justice sources denied they would comply with the ruling by publishing a draft bill , and stressed they were the lead department on the issue and opposed the right of prisoners to vote .They refused to discuss the state of internal negotiations , or whether a draft bill might be a means of deferring a decision .No 10 also deniedthere had been any decision to give prisoners voting rights .Misunderstandings about the Singapore Constitution .The outcome was not in the least bit surprising to me .The Constitution is quite clear -- the President has no discretion on clemency applications , but is instead required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .To my mind , this judgment is entirely correct in law .Understanding this better requires a little trip back in legal history .Singapore started off with a constitutional presidency -- the President was the head of state , but was a nominal one and was really a ceremonial post .This was consistent with Singapore being a parliamentary democracy in the Westminster tradition , where executive power lay wholly with the elected government of the day .If you will , the President was the republic 's equivalent to the constitutional monarchy in the UK ( i.e. the Queen of England ) .Under this approach , the President ( just like the Queen ) has no discretion and must act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .A constitutional crisis ensues if the President fails or declines for any reason to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .But this changed with the Elected Presidency amendments in 1991 .They introduced a hybrid approach whereby the President was to be elected , with some veto powers over executive decisions .These veto powers may be exercised by the President in his / her sole discretion , i.e. the President does not need to follow the advice of the Cabinet on such matters .But on all matters , the President continues to be bound by the advice of the Cabinet .Article 21 of the Singapore Constitution sets out this position .It lists those decisions where the President may use his / her own discretion .All other decisions must be made in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .It should be clear from Article 21 , that the power to grnat a pardon under Article 22 is one where the President is legally bound to follow the decision of the Cabinet .None of this is actually controversial .When I studied this in law school ( and my graduating class is having our 10-year reunion tomorrow , so this was 12 - 13 years ago ) , this was taught as a straightforward fact and there was no controversy on this .Indeed , even the Wikipedia entry on the President of Singapore ( current last edit being on 18 July 2010 ) correctly correctly describes how the powers of the President may be exercised .I want to be clear that I am talking about the law as it is , i.e. applying a \" positive \" approach to the law here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.34573"}

{"text": "It is an exercise in smoke and mirrors that is neither here nor there .I have to say , however , that this debate has brought to the fore important issues .We can talk about the words , but what counts is the action , and the actions of the Conservative Prime Minister are not to cling to sovereignty but to give it away .That is an interesting point .The Prime Minister , rightly or wrongly , certainly believes that it is in Britain 's national interest to adopt from time to time measures that he perceives to be in Britain 's national interest and then to encourage Parliament to follow suit .We have to decide whether that is the case - but that is another debate .The debate has brought to the fore a number of important issues .I am thinking in particular of the extremely important argument made in the European Scrutiny Committee 's report on the true nature of the threat to parliamentary sovereignty .The objective evidence presented by the Committee to the House leads it to conclude that .\" if the legitimate supremacy of Parliament is under threat , it is from judicial opinions in other areas of law \" , not EU law .That is true .I am thinking in particular of the Jackson case of 2004 , which concerned the constitutional validity of the Hunting Act 2004 , and in which three Law Lords indicated that in certain circumstances the courts had inherent powers to disapply legislation .According to those who hold this view , the sovereignty of Parliament is open to revision by the courts .In the Bill 's explanatory notes , the notion of parliamentary sovereignty as a construct of common law is expressed as though it were a matter of fact and entirely uncontroversial .Similarly , a one - page note on the Bill produced by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office states : .\" there is a common law principle that the UK Parliament is sovereign \" .It is dangerous to view the legislative supremacy of Parliament as an offshoot of common law , because it means that the principle will vary according to the judicial whims of judges at any given time .Whatever happens to the explanatory notes , we are still left with a problem , and I believe that the Foreign Office has known this all along .The hon .Gentleman might well have a point .This is something that has to be looked at carefully .I am mindful of the fact that although we are in Committee today , this is not the end of the process .I am sure that we will return to the issue on Report .It appears that the Government hold the view that parliamentary supremacy is a construct of common law .However , if that is the case , it could be argued that parliamentary sovereignty could be qualified by the courts and that this would not be opposed by the Government .Professor Tomkins , who has been referred to already is the distinguished chair of public law at the university of Glasgow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.55844"}

Windsor in June .The Court struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) , writing that it violates due process and equal protection principles found in the Fifth Amendment .The panel requested briefing on the decision 's impact , and on whether or not the decision applied a heightened level of judicial scrutiny .( Justice Kennedy 's majority opinion did n't directly address the level of scrutiny , except for a few passages in which he referred to \" careful \" review of anti - gay laws . )The opposing side had filed a brief suggesting that heightened scrutiny , and considering sexual orientation a \" suspect classification \" would be a prerequisite to a challenge to the striking of the juror .If the Ninth Circuit finds more backing for application of heightened scrutiny , it could eventually be applied .Today 's ruling holds that heightened scrutiny does apply , because of the implications of the Supreme Court 's decision last June in United States v.

Sunderland City Council .It is worth saying a little about that case because the issues raised were of great significance .The prosecution argued that the European treaties ' effect in domestic law did not depend - merely , at least - on the terms of their incorporation by the European Communities Act 1972 but , to a decisive extent , on the principles of European law itself .The argument was that European law had been entrenched rather than merely incorporated , by virtue not of any principle of domestic constitutional law but of principles of Community law already established in cases such as Van Gend en Loos v .Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen and Costa v. Enel , to which hon .Members have referred in this debate .If that argument had prevailed and if it were to prevail in the future , we would need to think about what the practical effect might be .For example , let me take the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of nationality set out in article 18 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union .Our courts have recognised that the provision has direct effect in the United Kingdom .If that statutory mechanism were to be repealed without replacement , there would be no basis on which it could be given direct effect in this country .Although those arguments were rejected by Lord Justice Laws , they could well be made again in future cases .That was a case of first instance and we do not know what might happen in future .Does my right hon .Friend accept the reasoning of Lord Bridge in Factortame ?He clearly stated that our adherence to the principles that flowed from an Act - the European Communities Act 1972-and therefore his judgment was based on a voluntary acceptance by this House , in its sovereignty .I add the words \" in its sovereignty \" , because that is the key issue .My hon .Friend starkly expressed his concern that at least some members of the senior judiciary had an agenda that deliberately set out to challenge the historic privileges and authority of Parliament .The third source of concern arises from various academic commentators on EU law , ranging from Professor J. D.

{"text": "It is intriguing that we are more than two hours into this debate but so far we have talked only about parliamentary sovereignty , even though the sovereignty technically still belongs to the Crown in Parliament .We all know about the events that took place over several hundred years , particularly when they were accelerated during the 17th century revolution and crisis .There was a large transfer of power from the Crown to Parliament .When a sufficiently large transfer of power takes place from someone who was sovereign to those who would be sovereign , a point is reached at which that sovereignty passes because enough power has been surrendered and the arrangements have changed sufficiently .As other Members have suggested , we need briefly to look at how that very big transfer of power occurred in the 17th century from the Crown to Crown in Parliament and , in due course , effectively to Parliament standing on its own .One important factor was that Parliament was very good at aggregating power to itself .In those days , it decided to be very nice to bankers , which worked very well for it , because it got the City of London and the men of finance on its side .In those days , the English Navy did not have French ships in it , and Parliament made sure that it responded to the English Parliament .Parliament also took the precaution of hiring and training and paying - something quite unusual in those days - the best army in the country .It got over the problem of competing armies and , in due course , established that it had military power and could command the Army .Parliament also needed to deal with the judges .It was established during the revolutionary period that judges were necessary and that , according to our current tradition , they had to be independent and should not interfere in parliamentary matters by trying to make the law .They simply had to deal with the law as Parliament provided it .We therefore eventually ended up with a very powerful Parliament .In the 19th and 20th centuries , Parliament did something that everyone in the House is now united in admiring : it made the exercise of power by Parliament a democratic matter by extending the franchise until practically every adult in this country was able to participate in elections .That gave Parliament the authority of having a democratic voice and mandate .The question that we are debating today is whether that great democratic settlement , in which most Members believe , is now under threat from judge - made law , from European -made law and from other centres of power .Could parliamentary sovereignty come under pressure in the not - too - distant future ?Is it being damaged because too much power is being transferred ?These questions account for the nervousness , certainly on the Conservative Benches , about the degree of power that has already been surrendered by successive Parliaments over the years , particularly under the most recent Government following the treaties of Nice , Amsterdam and Lisbon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.52323"}

{"text": "Thus , as we see with Redwood , the assertions have to be different - unique to him .But they are different for the sake of being different - they have to be in order to enable him to identify submission and assert his dominance .In this , however , there is a sad irony .While dominance behaviour is normal in lower order animals - seen even in guinea pigs - in humans it is often a sign of insecurity and weakness .It is exhibited most often by males on the fringes of the \" pack \" , who lack real power .Those who have power assert their dominance by exercising that power .They have no need for artefacts .In all senses one can see this weakness in the likes Redwood and the others , even in Nigel Farage - all are individuals who have never quite made it and harbour deep - rooted inferiority complexes .The real sadness , though , is that these individuals , in their quest to demonstrate their own personal status to their peers , are dragging down the \" leave \" campaign .Insistent on projecting perverse ideas for no better reason than to reinforce their own status , they cause confusion in the ranks and provide material for the opposition .Dealing with these people is less easy .In the animal kingdom , a more powerful alpha - male will challenge the pretender and force a submissive display , thereby restoring order to the pack .Humans , on the other hand , who are able to carve out intellectual \" territories \" , do n't work this way .They are able to define their territories by the number who submit ( i.e. , support ) them and exclude ( block ) those who refuse to yield .Unwittingly , this is why Twitter is so successful ( and often so unpleasant ) , as it allows free - rein for alpha - male dominance behaviour .For the \" leave \" campaign , this is disruptive and dangerous .We have become carved into disparate \" packs \" , each vying for its own band of supporters , the ultimate objective of leaving the EU having been subsumed into the more immediate need .Fortunately the answer does not require the pack leader to square off with the challenger , fangs bared .The key is that we are dealing with weak people on the margins .Therein lies the clue - they should be marginalised further , ignored where possible .And their status - seeking nostrums should be ridiculed .With Redwood , that is extraordinary easy to do .The animal instinct has buried his intellect and all we are left with is stupidity .We can , with ease , let stupid dogs lie .Tony E at Brexitdoor is one of our new generation of Brexit bloggers , and he 's already had a look at the loathsome Jonty Bloom , and his attempt to talk down the Norway Option .This is the second time in a month that the BBC have tried this , the trail blazed by Carolyn Quinn , who went to Greenland in order to do her business .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.97156"}

{"text": "No one with even the slightest familiarity with Flexcit could argue with any validity that it was \" EU - lite \" .However , of the many things we know about John Redwood , we would not mark him down as stupid .Everything points to him being a very clever man - a graduate of Magdalen College Oxford , a DPhil and a fellow of All Souls College .The question therefore , is why such a clever man should behave is such a stupid fashion .And discussing this earlier with Christopher Booker , we concluded that the answer lay in the realms of animal psychology .Redwood is performing the age - old ritual of the cock proclaiming his dominance from the top of the farmyard dung - heap .There is in fact a considerable body of scientific work , including the seminal 1993 work of Carlons Drews , on the concept and definition of dominance in animal behaviour .Drews defines the concept as : . ... an attribute of the pattern of repeated , agonistic interactions between two individuals , characterized by a consistent outcome in favour of the same dyad member and a default yielding response of its opponent rather than escalation .The status of the consistent winner is dominant and that of the loser subordinate .What Redwood is doing on his blog is displaying classic dominance behaviour , often known colloquially as \" top dogging \" , although this is not a term you want to google without qualification , as it can lead you into rather different areas .Often characterised as \" aggression \" , there are recorded very different attributes to dominance behaviour , where the outcome is defined as much by the submissive behaviour of the subordinate as by the winner 's actions .What it boils down to is that alpha - male Redwood is marking his territory , prior to defending it , and thereby asserting his dominance .In a pack animal such as a dog , this might be done by urinating on the bounds of his domain - the scent of which is distinct to that animal .For the likes of Redwood , where such behaviour in the corridors of Portcullis House would be frowned upon and less effective , he relies instead on statements distinct to himself , then inviting agreement with them .This \" agreement \" he can then interpret as \" submission \" , thereby reinforcing his self - perceived status as the pack leader .We get exactly the same behaviour from Daniel Hannan , David Campbell Bannerman and even Ruth Lea - the latter establishing that the behavioural characteristic can present in the female .We 're also getting it from Martin Durkin , with his misconceived attempt to make a film on leaving the EU .The essence of the dominance behaviour is that it must , by definition , be egregious - specific to the individual .If it reflects the consensus , or agreement with a competitive alpha - male , it can not invoke the desired submissive response that the initiator is seeking .The response becomes conformity rather than submission .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.39238"}

{"text": "Under that analysis , we are required by Windsor to apply heightened scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation for purposes of equal protection .The Ninth Circuit looked at the Windsor decision and ruled that the Supreme Court applied heightened scrutiny , without naming it directly : .Windsor review is not rational basis review .In its words and its deed , Windsor established a level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation that is unquestionably higher than rational basis review .In other words , Windsor requires that heightened scrutiny be applied to equal protection claims involving sexual orientation .Because the Windsor decision analyzed Section 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) under heightened scrutiny , that standard will now apply in the Ninth Circuit without rehearing the case en banc .The Windsor Court , the opinion notes , reviewed the actual purposes and justifications for the law , whereas under the more lenient rational basis standard , any conceivable rationale is enough to sustain a law .Secondly , the Windsor Court shifted the burden from the same - sex couple to the government when it wrote that the government has to \" justify disparate treatment of the group .\" This is also not a typical consideration under rational basis : the person bringing a challenge to the classification has to tell the court why all the conceivable rationales are irrational .The unanimous three - judge panel ultimately held that gay jurors ca n't be struck from a jury based on their sexual orientation : .Strikes exercised on the basis of sexual orientation continue this deplorable tradition of treating gays and lesbians as undeserving of participation in our nation 's most cherished rites and rituals .They tell the individual who has been struck , the litigants , other members of the venire , and the public that our judicial system treats gays and lesbians differently .They deprive individuals of the opportunity to participate in perfecting democracy and guarding our ideals of justice on account of a characteristic that has nothing to do with their fitness to serve .com%2F%3Fp%3D29444 .Whoo !Go Judge Reinhardt ! !Wow .This can be BIG .Excellent !This is what we 've been waiting for ... this is the crest of the wave that 's been building .Champagne tonight .How do folks think SCOTUS will react to this ?Was it their intention to \" in word and deed \" apply heightened scrutiny so that other courts , like the 9thC. , would be able to latch on to that without them having to spell it out ?Or did they avoid specifying heightened scrutiny on purpose because they are n't ready for it and will be unhappy about the 9thC 's interpretation ?Part of me assumes SCOTUS is getting what they wanted without having to get their hands dirty .But part of me wonders if they are getting bench - slapped again for being so mealy - mouthed .Kennedy deliberately avoided exactly naming heightened scrutiny in DOMA because he knew that would mean the end of the marriage bans in the entire country , but he did mention it in his opinion in the beginning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.88719"}
{"text": "Others have sought to challenge Mr Redwood directly , with Mike Stallard questioning his aversion to the Norway option , drawing attention to the fact that it is a \" stop - gap \" .The response has been nothing if not perverse , with Redwood asserting that he has \" no wish to end up in some EU - lite arrangement \" .Such a facile response would tend to reinforce Pete 's assessment that this is a malevolently stupid man writing .There can be little dispute that this is a particularly stupid response .No one with even the slightest familiarity with Flexcit could argue with any validity that it was \" EU - lite \" .However , of the many things we know about John Redwood , we would not mark him down as stupid .Everything points to him being a very clever man - a graduate of Magdalen College Oxford , a DPhil and a fellow of All Souls College .The question therefore , is why such a clever man should behave is such a stupid fashion .And discussing this earlier with Christopher Booker , we concluded that the answer lay in the realms of animal psychology .Redwood is performing the age - old ritual of the cock proclaiming his dominance from the top of the farmyard dung - heap .There is in fact a considerable body of scientific work , including the seminal 1993 work of Carlons Drews , on the concept and definition of dominance in animal behaviour .Drews defines the concept as : . ... an attribute of the pattern of repeated , agonistic interactions between two individuals , characterized by a consistent outcome in favour of the same dyad member and a default yielding response of its opponent rather than escalation .The status of the consistent winner is dominant and that of the loser subordinate .What Redwood is doing on his blog is displaying classic dominance behaviour , often known colloquially as \" top dogging \" , although this is not a term you want to google without qualification , as it can lead you into rather different areas .Often characterised as \" aggression \" , there are recorded very different attributes to dominance behaviour , where the outcome is defined as much by the submissive behaviour of the subordinate as by the winner 's actions .What it boils down to is that alpha - male Redwood is marking his territory , prior to defending it , and thereby asserting his dominance .In a pack animal such as a dog , this might be done by urinating on the bounds of his domain - the scent of which is distinct to that animal .For the likes of Redwood , where such behaviour in the corridors of Portcullis House would be frowned upon and less effective , he relies instead on statements distinct to himself , then inviting agreement with them .This \" agreement \" he can then interpret as \" submission \" , thereby reinforcing his self - perceived status as the pack leader .We get exactly the same behaviour from Daniel Hannan , David Campbell Bannerman and even Ruth Lea - the latter establishing that the behavioural characteristic can present in the female .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.40007"}

{"text": "I 'm hoping somebody can clear this up .Does this mean that Microsoft has to help out projects like Samba so that Linux can communicate with Windows over SMB ?Or does it extend all the way to helping Wine run Windows apps on Linux ?Personally , I hope it extends all the way .Imagine the Wine team not only having access to the Windows source ( They sort of do now due to the leak , but they ca n't do anything with it ) , but being given legal permission by the government to use it , with Microsoft 's help !Part of how they can strongarm the OEMs is that WMP and IE are bundled with with OS .If they have to have an unbundled version of Windows , then OEMs can supply other software instead .Imagine being able to buy a PC that might run Windows , but not comes with Mozilla and WinAmp ( or Opera & Realplayer or Quicktime ) , but does n't even have WMP and IE anywhere near it to hijack the User settings .Opening up their formats and interface hooks can also help stop them being anticompetitive , as having to keep up with people who use Microsoft platforms wo n't automatically require having to use one yourself .Plus , if nothing else , it shows Microsoft that they ca n't get away with being anticompetitive and automatically assuming that they 'll be supported by the government .Yes , but he replied to the statement : \" 'll still consider in Anti - American till they start coming down on European monopolists with as much fervor . \"Since Switzerland is European ( although not EU ) and not American , I think the poster you replied to gave a valid example .BTW , according to BBC [ bbc.co.uk ] , the second highest fine so far ( 296 m euros ) was imposed on BASF , which is a German company and thus European as well as from the EU .According to an article in a German newspaper [ spiegel.de ] ( sorry , it 's in German ) the money will go to the EU budget , reducing the money the EU member states would have to contribute by the same amount .For Germany that would mean 100 million Euros less to pay to the EU in that year .What \" media player market ?\" Is there a version of Windows Media Player that costs money ?All they 're doing is giving stuff away .They bundled IE not to get us hooked and jack up the prices , but because an OS should come with a browser .IE is free ( as in beer ) .MediaPlayer is free .So for the same business behavior , it is fair when you are small and it is unfair when you are big .I would say Microsoft is punished for being too successful , not for unfair practice .If Windows was 30 % of the market share , MS could add a media player and increase value , sure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.75775"}
