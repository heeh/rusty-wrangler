{"text": "In 2005 , Kansans were furious with the pro - abortion policies of Gov. Kathleen Sebelius -who had received abortion financial backing for many years : . her administration blocked late - term abortion investigations by pro - life Attorney General Phill Kline ; . she helped the state medical board hush up the death of a mentally disabled teen at George Tiller 's Wichita abortion clinic ; .she vetoed a desperately needed law to regulate and inspect abortion clinics ; . she deleted grant money budgeted for non - profit organizations that provide care to pregnant women .In 2006 , the abortion industry money machine and Kansas newspapers revved up to help Gov. Sebelius win re - election during which time : . she publicly appeared with Planned Parenthood head , Cecile Richards , railing against AG Kline for trying to prosecute abortion lawbreakers ; . social justice coalition meetings and phony online pro - life support groups were invented to downplay her abortion extremism ; . she campaigned for AG Paul Morrison- who would win and protect abortionists from prosecution before resigning in a sex scandal ; .From 2007 - 2009 , Sebelius .tried to force legislation promoting unethical research that destroys humans at the embryonic stage ; . vetoed , for the second time , the abortion clinic regulation law ; . appointed a new AG who blocked prosecution of Planned Parenthood and Tiller ; . was confirmed as HHS secretary ( claiming \" she had tried to reduce abortions \" ) and then vetoed a law to end Kansas late - term abortion corruption .There was much more , but this should suffice to remind us how we have left what was a horribly demoralizing time for pro - lifers .Kansas was known as the late - term abortion capitol under a protective Gov. Sebelius and corrupt key government bureaucrats .( read more here ) .But pro - lifers are persistent ... and Kansans for Life has partnered with them across the state to . help elect a pro - life Governor , Sam Brownback , and a pro - life legislative majority in both chambers .As we mark the day of mourning tomorrow with prayer and exhortations to reform the judiciary and hold our lawmakers accountable , we can be grateful for the challenges that did not stop us in Kansas from fighting to protect the unborn .Categories .Americas Complete Americas information Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Bahamas Belize Bolivia Brazil Canada Chile Colombia Costa Rica Cuba Dominican Republic Ecuador El Salvador Guatemala Guyana Haiti Honduras Jamaica Mexico Nicaragua Panama Paraguay Peru Trinidad and Tobago Uruguay USA Venezuela .Asia Complete Asia information Afghanistan Australia Bangladesh Brunei Cambodia China East Timor Fiji French Polynesia India Indonesia Japan Laos Malaysia Maldives Myanmar Nauru Nepal New Zealand North Korea Pakistan Papua New Guinea Philippines Singapore Solomon Islands South Korea Sri Lanka Taiwan Thailand Tonga Vietnam .Middle East & North Africa Complete Middle East & North Africa information Algeria Bahrain Egypt Iran Iraq Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory Jordan Kuwait Lebanon Libya Mauritania Morocco Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia Sudan Syria Tunisia UAE Yemen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.57117"}
