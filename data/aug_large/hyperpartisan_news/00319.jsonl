Bracken says the company has been able to pass along only about 2 % of those costs to retailers .Fort Worth - based Williamson - Dickie Manufacturing Co. says retail prices of its jeans have jumped an average of $ 2 as a result .The polyester pinch also drove textile producers into America 's used - PET - bottle market , where recycled containers are used to make polyester fibers that are then spun into everything from sweaters to upholstery .As a result , bottle prices shot from as low as 10 cents a pound a year ago to as much as 40 cents last spring , says Clifford J.

{"text": "As the New Year begins , Chicagoans are getting some direct encouragement to forgo buying disposable bottled water and switch to reusable bottles filled with fresh , clean water from the tap .In November , Chicago became the first city in the U.S. to pass a tax on bottled water sold within the city limits .The 5 cents per bottle tax went into effect on Jan. 1 , and is expected to raise $ 10.5 million for the city this year .( Filtration with a charcoal filter such as Brita or Pur is a common step taken to remove any chlorine aftertaste , though it I think it tastes fine straight from the faucet . )Of course , the new tax is meeting some resistance from businesses with an interest in the wasteful status quo .In addition to news reports of grumbling from some consumers who are used to buying their water bottles by the case , the tax now faces a legal challenge from some industry trade groups .Yep , it turns out that a lot of the folks who profit from selling tap water are willing to sue to protect their share of this huge - margin business .Real shocker , right ?Actually , the lawsuit is n't really surprising when you consider the racket that bottled water has become .The fact is , consumers regularly pay more per ounce for bottled water than they do for gasoline - and it 's much easier to manufacture .The city has responded to the suit by saying it is prepared to defend the tax in court .One argument that the suit makes is that the new tax is unfair because it does n't apply to other non - carbonated bottled beverages , such as milk , teas , coffees , and sports drinks .Chicago Law Department spokesman Jenny Hoyle responded by pointing out that , \" unlike these other beverages , tap water is a generally available , safe alternative in the city of Chicago .\" That 's a crucial difference , and one that makes intuitive sense .In other words , the taxing rules do n't need to be the same for Gatorade and water because the city is n't already in the business of providing an alternative to Gatorade through its infrastructure .Essentially , the city is taxing consumers for the convenience of the bottle , because the same thing is available in every working faucet in town .Time will tell if Chicago 's bottled water tax survives this legal challenge , but I sure hope it does .This kind of eco - sin tax seems like a smart way to spread the true economic costs to those who benefit from them .What 's good about this tax is that it creates a concrete financial incentive to switch your everyday , habitual water consumption to the sustainable model of refillable bottles rather than throwaway plastics .It gets people to take another look at that plastic bottle and assess the relative merits of its convenience versus the real economic price of its disposability .My guess is that the bottled water tax will be upheld and that after a few months of trying to get around the tax by driving outside the city limits to buy in bulk , many consumers here in Chicago will just make the switch to refillable bottles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.274796"}

{"text": "Why is this ?In large part this has been achieved due to the clever marketing of water bottle companies convincing us that bottled water is somehow better than highly regulated tap water .In some cases this is true , but ' manufactured demand ' comes from manufacturers trying to increase their sales at the expense of making products that they know a certain percentage of will end up as litter in the environment .The plastic bottle industry is creating a major environmental problem which is unprecedented in public litter problems , except for possibly the plastic bag .Some organizations have come to understand what problems plastic drink bottles are really causing .The town of Bundanoon in New South Wales , Australia has banned plastic water bottles and installed more chilled water fountains for its citizens .The University of Canberra in Australian Capital Territory , Australia has also banned bottled water from its campus .Two whole provinces in Canada have banned water bottles in favour of more environmentally friendly water supplies .A Bottle Refund Scheme .A bottle refund scheme is whereby people can cash their bottles in for a cash refund .Such a scheme has been in operation in the state of South Australia since 1977 .There the bottle recycle rate is a high 80 % and there is a noticeable lack of bottle litter on the highways and in parks .On average in Australia the bottle recycle rate is only 28 % , strongly indicating that even a small refund of $ 0.10 can make a significant difference to attitudes towards litter .There are other benefits to a refund scheme as well .Due to their bulk , drink containers compromise about 30 % of total landfill litter .Reducing bottles from the litter stream saves on valuable landfill space .Reducing the number of drink bottles from household waste reduces the local council 's pick up and disposal cost of trash .These savings can be invested in other ways back into the community .Many consumers donate their bottles to community groups such as The Scouts or sports organisations .The Scouts in South Australia raise $ 9 million a year on bottle refunds .Recycling bottles into new bottles avoids using new raw materials to make the new bottles .There are less CO2 emissions and less water used to process them .There are few recycling containers for drinks consumed away from home .The implementation of a refund scheme would make it worthwhile for businesses like cafes and restaurants who sell a lot of these bottled drinks to collect the bottles and cash them in for the refund .There are a number of new jobs that are created to run and administer the scheme .The Australian state of Victoria has submitted a bill to the State parliament to have such a scheme introduced for Victoria .There are approximately 2 billion plastic bottles consumed in the state a year .( 4.4 billion containers in total , including glass , aluminium , and steel . )Only 28 % are currently recycled .In this scheme the manufacturers would pay to the state EPA a fee of 10 cents for every drink container they produce .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.79603"}
