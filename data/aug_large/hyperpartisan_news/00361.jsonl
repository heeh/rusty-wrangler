{"text": "With the Administration changing its position and announcing it will not enforce federal laws in states where marijuana has been legalized and will permit same - sex couples to file joint tax returns , the question will be asked - is President Obama changing American traditions ?President Obama did not make decisions about legalizing marijuana or same - sex marriage - the voters in various states made those decisions with their votes and in the case of same - sex marriage , the Supreme Court has ruled the vote to ban same - sex marriage was unconstitutional .This is not so much a defense of the President as it is a reminder of basic civics .The day will come when criticism of a president for leading American in the wrong direction will come from the other side of the political spectrum and the same defense will be part of that debate .Political tension is so high in America that this growing trend of blaming a president for anything and everything is certain to continue - unless Americans on both sides of the political aisle focus more on facts than rhetoric .America is changing - and change , even if it 's positive change , will always be resisted by those who sense a loss of stability in an already rapidly - changing world .But change is a natural necessity in the evolution of society .The path to recognition of legal same - sex marriage as a fundamental right and the path toward the greater acceptance of marijuana use winds through both Republican and Democrat presidents .When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state laws banning sodomy were unconstitutional in 2003 , many on the right deemed this as the opening of the door to legalized same - sex marriage .That milestone occurred when President George W. Bush was in office .California was the first state to legalize the medicinal use of marijuana in 1996 - when President Bill Clinton was in office .The trends toward accepting same - sex marriage and the legalization of marijuana have found fertile ground when both parties occupied the White House - so it can be argued that these trends reach beyond partisan politics .In reality , it is actually the growing consensus of the people that is changing America - not the President .Obama 's hatred of American as founded is evident in all his policies ... .his hatred , however , will eventually return to him .Obama is a small - minded little man with no class and is full of envy , resentment , and hatred .He is a dark cloud on this country that will take years to clear away after he finally is removed via term limits .Seattle , WA - Some 6.8 million Americans awoke today confident that their state is not only the most progressive in the nation , but even more so than Canada and Amsterdam .That 's because , while Colorado voters legalized pot and Maine and Maryland voters approved gay marriage yesterday , Washingtonians accomplished both feats with two historic ballot measures that cemented the liberal - utopian reputation of this upper - left corner of the continental United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.8288"}

{"text": "\" We should consider legalizing the production , distribution and sale of drugs , \" Fox wrote on his blog during the series of forums . \"Legalizing in this sense does not mean that drugs are good or do n't hurt those who consume .Rather , we have to see it as a strategy to strike and break the economic structure that allows the mafias to generate huge profits in their business . \"Calderon immediately said Mexico could n't act on its own to legalize .\" If drugs are not legalized in the world , or if drugs are not legalized at least in the United States , this is simply absurd , because the price of drugs is not determined in Mexico .The price of drugs is determined by consumers in Los Angeles , or in New York , or in Chicago or Texas , \" he said .Such public debate would have been largely unthinkable a few years ago .Since Calderon came to office in late 2006 , however , a national gloom has descended on Mexico from unending cartel violence and a death toll topping 28,000 .The grim mood has provided fertile ground for public figures who think that legalization would undercut the power of the drug cartels .Among them are business tycoons such as billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego , who controls broadcaster TV Azteca , and retailer Grupo Elektra .With his own pro - legalization statement , Fox aligned with another former president , Ernesto Zedillo , who suggested last year that prohibition is n't working .Still , several analysts said debate about legalization - coming most strongly from the political left - was an attempt to needle Calderon as much as an exploration of whether legalization is feasible .Edgardo Buscaglia , an expert on Mexico 's criminal syndicates , said Mexico 's government is too weak to legalize and regulate narcotics and marijuana .\" You need to have regulatory capacity in place , \" he said .\" Mexico does not even have the capacity to regulate its pharmaceutical products .\" Without a better framework , any move to take away penalties for narcotics would \" amount to a subsidy to drug organizations , \" he said , as prices and demand remain buoyant for illegal narcotics in the U.S. and other countries .Legislators in August 2009 quietly decriminalized the possession of less than 5 grams of marijuana , the equivalent of about four joints .Tiny amounts of cocaine , heroin , ecstasy , LSD , and methamphetamine also are no longer subject to criminal penalties .Further measures have been blocked , however , such as one before two committees of the Chamber of Deputies to permit the use of marijuana for medical purposes , as 14 U.S. states allow .Others have been put before the Senate , the legislative assembly of Mexico City and before a local congress in the state of Mexico .Hernandez Tinajero said he thinks that Mexican society may not be ready for such moves , but that the California initiative on marijuana would impel debate further .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.79563"}
