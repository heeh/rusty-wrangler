{"text": "However , as I discovered in an interview last week on Ari Melber 's Let 's Talk radio show , a post I wrote for US News in mid - August headlined \" Do the Rules Apply to Donald ? \" may have inadvertently contributed to the perception that political scientists are baffled by Trump 's staying power .On average , their period of discovery , scrutiny and , eventually , a polling decline lasted about two months .Trump , in contrast , has been leading polls going on four months , with no clear sign of a polling decline as yet .As I conceded to Melber , when The Donald announced his candidacy last July , I did not anticipate that he would remain atop the polls for this long .( Nor , I suspect , did many of my colleagues ) .But this does n't mean we are clueless when it comes to understanding why he has remained the front - runner for so long .As I wrote in July soon after Trump began his meteoric rise in the polls , his candidacy was being fueled by a media that found his controversial , over - the - top rhetoric impossible to ignore .Alas , I have little confidence that most journalists , in this era of dwindling audiences and shrinking profit margins , will be able to resist taking the easy road by dismissing The Donald as a serious candidate .To date , it is a media strategy that has The Donald laughing all the way to the top of polls . \"In retrospect , where I miscalculated was in not fully believing my own prediction ; clearly I underestimated the media 's willingness to resist The Donald 's ability to dictate his press coverage .It turns out that pundits have found it impossible not to report on Trump 's rhetorical excesses , even as they chide themselves for doing so .As John Sides demonstrates , The Donald 's standing in the polls closely tracks the amount of media coverage he has received ; as coverage goes up , so does his standing in the polls .Note that it hardly matters whether the coverage is negative or not - as Sides indicates , it is not as if the media has refrained from criticizing The Donald for his often intemperate remarks .But that simply provides him with more free publicity , which seems to boost his polling support .So what , if anything , will cause Trump to drop out of the top polling spot ?The simple answer is that it will require someone more newsworthy to begin to eat into his media coverage .For what it is worth , for the first time in months someone other than Trump - in this case Ben Carson - landed atop a recent national poll , although it may be too early to read much into this .This one poll notwithstanding , Trump remains in the lead based on aggregate polling .And it would not be surprising if Trump gets a temporary polling boost based on tonight 's Republican debate due to the renewed media focus on his candidacy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.39729"}

Mary Fallin and the Oklahoma Republican Party , all have made the news recently for supposedly miscommunicating ideas , and the local and national media has seized on them voraciously .Here 's how it works : A politician says something controversial .The media reports it .The politician 's opponents demand an apology or ridicule what the politician said .The media reports it .The initial politician then issues some type of clarification or apology .The politician 's opponents claim that it is n't enough .The media reports it .Then another politician gaffes it up , and the cycle repeats itself .The next presidential election does n't happen until 2016 so I will go out on a limb and forecast a lot of gaffe reporting awaits us in the future .Must be the season of the gaffe .On the local level recently , Fallin made news when she appeared in front of reporters to not know the three branches of government .That was followed by an Oklahoma Republican Party Facebook post that compared people on food stamps to animals , which created a tremendous amount of controversy .Both made national news .Fallin , to my knowledge never clarified her statement .The chair of the Oklahoma GOP , Randy Brogdon , apologized after a storm of criticism .In each case , however , the main issue seemed to get lost in the reporting .As I argued earlier , Fallin most likely knows the three branches of government include the executive , judicial and legislative .Here 's what she said that caused the media firestorm : .You know , there are three branches of our government .You have the Supreme Court , the legislative branch and the people , the people and their ability to vote .So I 'm hoping that we can address this issue in the legislative session and let the people of Oklahoma decide .The media , of course , focused on how she clumsily described the branches of government .But it was her main point that deserved more discussion .Her point basically was that Oklahoma voters , not a court , should be allowed to decide the fate of the Ten Commandments monument on state Capitol grounds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.57753"}

{"text": "While the media chases its tail in trying to hold the Donald accountable for his latest outrageous statement , he uses that coverage to cite his very real track record of getting things done , and to promise that he will reprise that record as President .But it is in fact Donald 's private sector experience ( and concomitant lack of political experience ) that is potentially the real vulnerability of his candidacy , if only the media would take the time to examine it .Consider the following anecdote provided by the late , great political scientist James Q. Wilson in his classic book Bureaucracy , which is a study of how government works - or does not work , as the case might be .In the early 1980 's , as Wilson tells the story , the city of New York spent some $ 13 million dollars across a six - year period in an ultimately fruitless effort to renovate the Central Park skating rink .At this point The Donald stepped in and agreed to renovate the rink for $ 3 million , with any cost - overrun coming out of his own pocket .Mayor Ed Koch agreed to the deal .Trump completed the rink renovations a month ahead of schedule , and $ 750,000 under budget .At first glance , this example seems to feed into The Donald 's argument that as president he would have the expertise and experience to get things accomplished .But in reciting this story about the skating rink , Wilson is making a more subtle and important point , one that potentially undercuts the relevance of The Donald 's private sector experience as preparation to be President .Wilson is using the skating rink example to demonstrate how the very factors that made the Donald so effective in the private sector are rarely to be found in the political sphere .As Wilson acknowledges , The Donald proved far more efficient than did government in renovating the skating rink .But ultimately public policy is evaluated on more than narrow grounds of economic efficiency - instead , \" government has many valued outputs , including a reputation for integrity , the confidence of the people , and the support of important interest groups .\" I would add that governing in the public sphere at the national level requires an understanding of how to address the interests of those , such as members of Congress , whose support is required if the President is to accomplish his objectives .By extension , Wilson is suggesting that the tactics that work so well for The Donald in the private sector are unlikely to be as effective when it comes to passing public policy .This is because other values - accountability , transparency , and equity - are embedded in our political process to a degree not seen in private sector transactions .As President , The Donald will find that he can not run roughshod over the political constraints built into our national system of separated institutions sharing power .Building a wall to keep out illegal immigrants will be nothing like renovating the Central Park skating rink , and that is not simply due to the different scale of the projects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.50656"}

Sullivan .In that 1964 case , the Court liberated speech about our leaders but closely linked that freedom to our responsibility to discuss important political or cultural issues .The idea was already at the core of the First Amendment : Eliminate governmental checks on zealous and participatory c 1000 itizens discussing the central matters of the day .I hear that Chelsea has n't spoken to him in months .Unfortunately , the Court digressed rapidly when , in cases involving public figures ( but not public officials ) , the justices saw an equal need to expand speech .These decisions helped lower the First Amendment to the baleful level of supporting speech about celebrities and diminishing it about the central issues of American governance .In Gertz v. Robert Welch ( 1974 ) , the Court drifted from the central lesson of Times v. Sullivan by dividing us into two groups : \" public \" and \" private \" people .Instead of adhering to the time - honored notion that all speech about public issues matters , Gertz reduced the importance of even such utterances if they happen to conflict with the reputational interests of so - called private figures .The holding actually created an incentive for us to remain private , to desist from activities that might make it harder for us to sue if we felt our good names had been defamed .Thus , while ostensibly adhering to the holding in The New York Times , the case disastrously overturned the earlier decision 's model for public discussion and debate by making the issue the status of the person libeled instead of the importance of the subject matter discussed .The lead opinion in Gertz was authored by the recently deceased Justice Louis Powell .This \" courtly gentleman \" deserves some of the fault for bringing us to the point of discussing lipstick and stained dresses instead of the public issues he surely preferred .By dividing us into classes of \" important \" people and merely \" private \" individuals , Justice Powell unwittingly encouraged the passivity felt by many ordinary Americans today in the face of the complex issues that need our attention .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.87903"}

{"text": "The BBC is by no means perfect and it does strike me that its news coverage in recent years has become , like that of many other news organisations , more superficial .I also tend to the view that its journalists are perhaps less skilled than they were a decade or so ago .Less literate , less educated , less rounded in terms of knowledge and experience .Frankly I suspect that this may be because journalists these days are less committed to quality journalism than they are to their own fat salaries .But the notion that the BBC news is intentionally biased is as silly now as it was twenty or thirty years ago when it was first suggested by those on the extreme right of politics .I always took the view that if Norman Tebbitt was upset by the BBC 's coverage then the dear old Beeb must have been doing something right !And the same goes for the ridiculous splutterings of today 's right wing apologists .If the BBC appears to them to be more biased now than it did ten years ago that may not be because the BBC has changed but because they have become more right wing and more intolerant in their views .In my view the broad consensus of people 's outlook in the UK is that they are tolerant , fair - minded and generous spirited - and the BBC news coverage reflects that fact .It 's no surprise that the hard Right finds that objectionable .I 'm not sure if I can respond again to a number of issues but here goes .I think my real bug - bear is on how the Iraqi Survey Groups findings were reported .I took the trouble of downloading the said document from the BBC and promtly started reading .This is an invalubale historical document , providing details of how Saddam ran Iraq , the Oil for Food programme , as well as the findings on WMD .As I was reading the headline \" No WMD 's found in Iraq \" flashed up .I 'm not even talking about the undiscovered labs run by IIS , the effective end of UN sanctions , the continued R&D work , or the human experiments that were carried out - all in breach of UN resolutions .Hold on I thought - am I reading something different here ?I put my complaint to the Beeb , to be told Jerermy Paxman would be interviewing Dr Kay on the findings in Newsnight .Great I thought , Jerermy Paxman with Robert Harris has documented the history of WMD(including Iraq)-bound to be a good interview .Did any of the issues or items come up .No , but plenty to \" imply \" that the UK / US Governments were \" lying \" about Saddams intentions and the threat to the region .And not long afterwards was the \" sexy document and Dr Kelly affair \" .Now this has become \" fact \" that there were no WMD ( dispite the caveates both in this report , Hutton and Butler ) and therefore Blair and Bush \" lied \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.01546"}
