Albert Sidney Johnston and Postmaster General John H. Reagan -- had nothing at all to do with the university , which opened nearly 20 years after the end of the Civil War .The statues were commissioned by a university benefactor early in the 20th Century .To them , the secession of the 11 Confederate states was about more than slavery -- it was a principled reaction to the North 's interference in what Southerners perceived as their sovereign rights .And when the fighting started , they contend , most of their ancestors took up arms in defense of their homes and families , not the institution of slavery .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "31.96405"}

McEachern , was a tyrant who punished prisoners by such methods as hanging them by their thumbs and forcing them to stand out in the Texas sun for hours at a time .With such an overflow of prisoners , oversight was poor , and it is estimated that about 10 percent of prisoners escaped and made their way back to Union lines .Late in 1864 , prisoner exchanges resumed , and hundreds of Union captives were taken to the mouth of the Red River and paroled .On May 13 , 1865 , the 1,800 remaining prisoners were told that the war had ended .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.113945"}

Lamar , and so on .Trust me , nobody would ever know the difference .Perhaps the offending statues could be relocated to Texas A&M University , which does n't support slavery , but perhaps is capable of recognizing history for what it is - the facts - instead of trying to rewrite it .Those people depicted by the statues did n't always do the right thing , only one person in history ever did , but they served honorably without the benefit of today 's circumstances to enlighten their paths .In their day , they may have been far better leaders in many ways than those we honor with positions of leadership today .They probably would be astonished by some aspects of what we accept as liberty today .\" Our Nation needs to clear away the guilts and enmities and recriminations of the past , to finally set at rest the divisions that threatened to destroy our Nation and to discredit the principles on which it was founded .Our people need to turn their attention to the important tasks that still lie before us in establishing those principles for all people . \" - Jimmy Carter , 1978 , when he gave Jefferson Davis his full American citizenship . terry .Don , I like your optimism but how much will it cost to shift a building 180 degrees and is it possible ?I m assuming you were joking when you suggested that solution . 2 & 3 are contradictory . rbblum .The University of Texas tower should also be razed since it is a painful reminder of Chas Whitman 's 1966 social assault with deadly firearms upon 16 innocent souls . dallastexasviewer .If the people complaining only knew that Jeff Davis , Robert Lee , Gen Beauregard , etc . were just as easily secret agents for the Union as they were Confederate elites .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.5983"}

A. Trenckmann in 1891 ; the paper was later moved to Austin .Not until the Civil War did German migration into the county subside .By 1850 the county population included 750 German - born residents , 33 percent of the white population ; American - born farmers outnumbered their German - born counterparts by the same two - to - one ratio .By 1860 , however , German - born farmers outnumbered the American - born .The steady stream of southerners arriving with slave property pushed the county 's slave population steadily upward .By 1860 , slaves accounted for 39 percent of the population .In 1860 twelve Austin County residents ranked among the wealthiest individuals in the state , i.e. , as holders of at least $ 100,000 in property .Six residents held more than 100 slaves .From 1824 to 1837 San Felipe was the only town in Austin County .By the early 1850s , however , Industry , Travis , Cat Spring , Sempronius , Millheim , and New Ulm had appeared .In the mid 1800 's , many Texas communities were nothing more than clusters of farms with a post office and general store near the center of the settlement .Despite the increase in steamboat traffic on the Brazos in the 1850 's , the primary means of transportation was the ox drawn wagon .By the late 1850s , the first railroad arrived in the area ( The Houston and Texas Central extended its main line northward through Hockley to Hempstead , in the eastern district of the county east of the Brazos , in June 1858 ) .Cotton was shipped to the rail line by wagon from western Austin County crossing the Brazos at a number of ferries between San Felipe and the mouth of Caney Creek .Most German immigrants arrived in Texas too late to receive free land , the distribution of which ceased in the early 1840s .Furthermore , most had been compelled to expend so much of their money on the way that they had relatively little to buy land and livestock .In 1856 Germans near Cat Spring formed one of the earliest agricultural societies in Texas , the Cat Spring Landwirthschaftlicher Verein , which continues to today .Germans also owned few slaves .Yet , except in the case of a relatively small group of Forty - Eighter intellectuals , this circumstance was due far less to philosophical opposition to slavery - as many Anglo - Americans suspected - than to the fact that most German immigrants lacked the money to buy slaves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.18918"}

Austin 's father , Moses , who had originally obtained permission from the Mexican government in January , 1821 , to bring three hundred families to Texas to establish a colony .However , before he could begin to carry out his colonization plan he died with pneumonia on June 10 , 1821 .Prior to his death , Moses Austin had requested that his son be allowed to carry out this colonization plan , which Stephen F. Austin was permitted to do .He was instructed by the Mexican authorities to explore the area on the Colorado River that he expected to settle .Austin reported back to the Mexican authorities outlining the boundaries he desired for his colony and submitted the plan he had devised for the distribution of land .In order to attract settlers for his new colony Austin advertised in newspapers and offered the incentive of additional land to those who possessed skills which could be used by all who settled in the colony .Those families which followed Austin settled on the west bank of the Brazos River , above the mouth of Mill Creek .FIRST EUROPEAN DECENT SETTLERS IN WHAT BECAME AUSTIN COUNTY .In 124 Stephen F. Austin was commissioned the political chief of the colony .In July , 1824 the general land office was opened at San Felipe de Austin , the unofficial capitol of the Anglo - American settlements in Texas .At this time titles were issued for the amount of land allowed by the contract of colonization , which was 640 acres for each single man or head of the family , 320 acres for a wife , 160 acres for each child and 80 acres for each slave .These early settlers usually built near streams where water could easily be found and an abundance of wood for building and fencing material , as well as where fuel would be readily available .Most of the area within Austin County lies within the drainage basin of the Brazos River , which forms the eastern border of the county .PRE - HISTORIC HISTORY OF AUSTIN COUNTY REGION .Some archeological evidence supports Paleo Indian presense in what became Austin County as earrly as 7400 B.C.

{"text": "A 1997 state law , dubbed the \" top 10 percent rule , \" allowed automatic acceptance to public universities in the state for public high school students who ranked in top 10 percent of their graduating class .The law was a response to a previous court decision that barred consideration of race for admissions - that ruling was later overturned .Although the policy was intended to promote diversity , without having to take into account an applicant 's race or ethnicity , policymakers feared it was dominating UT admissions and leaving university officials with little discretion over the student body 's makeup .The policy was modified in 2008 .Scaling back Top 10 .By 2008 , 81 percent of freshmen were admitted under the top 10 percent rule , all coming from public Texas high schools .That meant all Texas students ranking in the 11th percentile of their class or worse , private school students , out - of - state students and international applicants had fewer chances to make it into UT .Starting in 2011 , UT was allowed to cap its automatic admissions at 75 percent of the incoming class .Automatic admissions is now limited to the top 7 or 8 percent of Texas high - school classes .In 2013 , more than 38,000 students applied for admission - while the entire undergraduate population was 39,995 .Of that year 's applicants , 10,000 were offered accepted automatically .Texas A&M surpassed 50,000 students in 2011 and has now eclipsed UT 's total enrollment of 50,950 with 58,577 students , with no percentage cap on its automatically admitted students .Presidential influence .Because of the limited spots open outside of the top 10 percent rule , some Texans have used their influence to get students accepted .Former UT - Austin President William Powers Jr. and former UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa bypassed the admissions office to accept underqualified students .The offers were based on requests from lawmakers , millionaire donors and members of university 's Board of Regents .New policies set in August allow campus presidents to admit individual students in rare cases .They must argue the rationale for overruling the admissions process to the chancellor .Admissions and race .The university 's admissions process has been challenged before .Long before the Fisher case , UT was at the center of another landmark case that ended segregation at the university 65 years ago , four years before the Brown vs. Board of Education case .In 1950 , after a Supreme Court battle , Heman Marion Sweatt was the first black student admitted , attending UT 's School of Law .Promoting diversity on campus is now one of the university 's arguments for incorporating race in the admissions process , since the campus has historically been overwhelmingly white .Colleges and universities have long been addressing questions about race and ethnicity , \" Fenves said .\" The heightened attention of this issue over the past few months reminds us this is of ongoing importance .White students made up a majority of the student body until 2010 , and their numbers still far outpace other ethnicities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.56218"}

Ervendberg between 1840 and 1844 .The earliest agricultural society in Texas was formed in the town immediately after the Civil War .WHY THE CZECHS CAME TO TEXAS .Reverend Arnost Bergman , born August 12 , 1797 in Zupudor , near Mnichova Hradiste in Czechoslovakia immigrated to Texas and settled in Cat Spring in March , 1849 , where he bought land and began to farm .TEXAS HISTORICAL MARKER IN AUSTIN COUNTY : \" People from Czechy began to come to America for liberty as early as 1633 .First known Czech in Texas was Jiri Rybar ( George Fisher ) , customs officer in Galveston in 1829 .Others arrived individually for years before letters sent home by Rev.
