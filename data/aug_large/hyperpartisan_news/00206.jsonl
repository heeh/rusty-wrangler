Frank Antenori held an event where a dozen people offered cash for guns to be added to their own collections .Police said Wednesday they took in 206 guns at Kozachik 's event after noting the names of people who surrendered weapons , checking serial numbers to be sure the guns were n't stolen , and making certain the weapons were owned and purchased legally .Antenori , who lost his re - election bid in November , said he organized his event - which became an unregulated but legal marketplace for gun sales - because offering gift cards for weapons amounted to stealing . \" Can you name me one firearm in working condition that 's worth $ 50 or less ? \" he said .Kozachik , also a Republican , said the gathering of men holding signs reading \" Cash for Guns \" bolstered his argument that gun laws need to be reformed .\" We have a fundamental hole in the private sales of guns .You can walk up right in front of a cop and buy a gun , no background check , nothing , \" Kozachik said .\" How much more flawed can the system be ? \"Antenori left the event early , and the gun - buyers refused to comment .Giffords was severely injured in a Jan. 8 , 2011 , shooting rampage as she met with constituents outside a supermarket .Six people were killed and 12 others injured .She and her husband Mark Kelly have formed a political action committee to prevent gun violence and change laws to require , among other things , comprehensive background checks for all firearms sales .They outlined the effort this week in an editorial in USA Today and in an interview on ABC News that also provided a new glimpse at Giffords ' recovery since she was shot in the head .Giffords struggled to speak in complete sentences but provided several one - word answers to ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer in describing her recovery and response to the shootings in Tucson and Connecticut , where 20 school children were killed .She said \" daggers \" to recount her tense , face - to - face encounter with Tucson gunman Jared Lee Loughner at his November sentencing when he was given life in prison .She said \" sad \" to describe his mental illness , and expressed frustration that her recovery has not progressed more quickly .Asked by Sawyer about the shooting of schoolchildren in Connecticut , Giffords replied with just one word - \" Enough .\" Giffords has a service dog named Nelson that helps her keep balance and guides her as she works with speech and physical therapists .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.05638"}

{"text": "This response should be expected given the traditional American attitude towards guns and the banning of any commodity deeply valued by a substantial portion of society .Finally , constitutional protections , other than the right to keep and bear arms , have been violated and are threatened by the enforcement of restrictive firearms laws .Present enforcement of firearms statutes account for numerous illegal searches and seizures by the police .Most often these unconstitutional searches and seizures are directed against the poor and racial minorities .Violent crime , however serious , does not justify the wholesale violation of fundamental freedoms , such as the right to be secure in one 's person and effects from unwanted government intrusion .The historical purpose of gun control laws in America has been one of discrimination and disenfranchisement of blacks , immigrants , and other minorities .American gun control laws have been enacted to disarm and facilitate repressive actions against union organizers , workers , the foreign - born and racial minorities .Bans on particular types of firearms and firearms registration schemes have been enacted in many American jurisdictions for the alleged purpose of controlling crime .Often , however , the purpose or actual effect of such laws or regulations was to disarm and exert better control over the above - noted groups .The development of racially based slavery in the seventeenth century American colonies was accompanied by the creation of laws meting out separate treatment and granting separate rights on the basis of race .An early sign of such emerging restrictions and one of the most important legal distinctions was the passing of laws denying free blacks the right to keep arms .Behind current gun control efforts often lurks the remnant of an old American prejudice , that the lower classes and minorities are not to be trusted with firearms .The bias originated in the post - antebellum south for political reasons and may have changed its form , but it still exists .Today the thought remains , if you let the poor , and especially the black poor , have guns , they will commit crimes with them .Even noted anti - gun activists have admitted this .Even today firearms regulations target minorities or other unpopular groups .For instance , present Massachusetts law still makes possession of guns by aliens a criminal offense .Present federal statutes make it a felony for one dishonorably discharged , or having renounced American citizenship to purchase or possess a firearm .This federal statute is surely a punitive measure against those who have trespassed certain norms of acceptable behavior even though there is no indication of violent criminal tendencies .The worst abuses at present occur under the mantel of facially neutral laws that are , however , enforced in a discriminatory manner .In St. Louis permits are automatically denied to wives who do n't have their husband 's permission , homosexuals , and non - voters .As one of my students recently learned , a personal ' interview ' is now required for every St. Louis application .After many delays , he finally got to see the sheriff , who looked at him only long enough to see that he was n't black , yelled ' he 's alright ' to the permit secretary , and left .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.89904"}

{"text": "However , winning the debate for public sentiment gave pro - ban Senators a practical dilemma -- there is really no such thing as an assault weapon .The one common feature these weapons have is that they are semiautomatic ( fully automatic weapons were banned in 1934 ) .This characteristic is hardly a distinguishing feature , though , because virtually every rifle sold in America today is a semiautomatic .Senators knew they could not get away with banning semiautomatics because such a ban would be equal to banning nearly every rifle in America .To solve this practical problem , they sat down and thumbed through gun catalogues and picked out some 19 weapons that looked particularly scary to them .These 19 rifles , shotguns , and pistols have cosmetic features on them that make them look more dangerous to people who are unfamiliar with firearms , but they possess no capabilities that are not possessed by other semiautomatic weapons .They then studied these 19 pictures to decide what it was about these particular weapons that made them look more dangerous , and they settled on several cosmetic features , such as folding stocks , large pistol grips , bayonet mounts , and flash suppressors .None of these features makes any weapon any more dangerous , yet they decided any weapon with two or more of these features is an assault weapon , and they have steadily insisted that only a lunatic or a felon would possess one .To illustrate the absurdity of this definition , we remind our colleagues that President Clinton recently used a semiautomatic shotgun when he went duck hunting .Add a couple of cosmetic changes to this weapon and our President would have been holding an assault weapon .If those changes had been made , would our colleagues have classified the President as a lunatic or a felon , or both ?In an effort to make this gun ban look more reasonable , our colleagues added an appendix of 670 weapons that would not be banned .Less than 13 percent of those weapons , though , are even semiautomatic firearms , and thus by definition were not affected by the Feinstein gun - ban language .Of the remaining 85 , many are repeatedly counted ; for example , the Remington Model 870 pump shotgun makes the list 16 times .The truth , according to the BATF , is that this gun ban will make between 100 and 160 firearms currently on the market illegal .It will also make 3.3 million of the 200 million firearms currently owned by law - abiding Americans illegal .The crime rate will not decline , though , simply because semiautomatic firearms are almost never used by criminals .Thus , there will be no trade off between a loss of second amendment rights and an increase in safety .The only result of this ban will be to infringe on the constitutional right to keep and bear arms .When this ban fails , we suspect our colleagues will conclude that the problem was that it did not go far enough .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.02457"}
