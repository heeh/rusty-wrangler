{"text": "As an ESL teacher , I know that my students often come from countries that have a different idea of community and that offering food is something you just do .How is it any different for you to decide my kid ought to have some candy which I did n't provide , vs. for another parent to decide your kid ought to have some help you did n't provide ?Or someone who takes my child out of a tree although I am standing right there and clearly not objecting to the climbing .Or when I tell my child \" no \" after she calls for help and someone decides to help her anyway .All of these have happened in playgrounds and all annoyed me .That is a HUGE difference from your stance that any attempt to offer anything to an unaccompanied child is somehow underminding parental authority .I do n't expect my own 1st graders to refuse candy if offered .So everyone should never offer any child in the world candy because you do n't want to expect your 1st grader to refuse candy ?I fully expect my 1st grader to do whatever the heck I tell her to do , including refuse candy if so told .Of course , I am sometimes let down in that expectation .But then my beef is with her , not with a person that innocently offered her something that I have told her not to accept .What is so hard about just asking yourself \" would I want someone doing this with my child / would the average parent be OK with it \" before acting ?I never do something for another child that I would object to someone doing for mine .That 's the point .I 'm going to guess that , barring a true pedophile trying to lure a child , EVERYONE who offers a child candy would allow their child to take candy in that particular situation .People do not randomly offer things that are opposed to their own views .You do n't want people to think about what they would do and do that at all .You want them to divine what YOU would do and are bugged when people ( 1 ) think differently about candy than you , and ( 2 ) are incapable of reading your mind .I agree that offering candy to a strange child from a car is odd and not something I would do or want my child to accept .However , I am willing to allow her to accept candy from strangers in a myriad of other situations .You simply believe that everyone should feel the same away about candy and not everyone does .delurking , a police officer who notices something like this and acts on it is definitely doing the kind of community policing thing you 're talking about , and that 's all good .But calling the police on someone is usually something that is done in response to a crime , not something you do because you think that a person might possibly be doing something that could lead to a crime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.98743"}
{"text": "you re welcome !Its not a light chain , mind you .Do chain that to something less movable .I share a bike spot with a neighboor when visiting a friend and lock our bikes together since there is no posts around Two years ago , my wife bought me a steel frame comfort bike from a bike shop in our area .It was a Giant Sedona ST which was great for riding around the neighborhood and some of the parks with short tracks .I heard about this bike club that rides on Saturday mornings and rode with them a few times .Most of the riders there are over 50 and some over 60 , as am I , and most were on hybrids and road bikes and I was having a hard time keeping up .So , after 10 months of the steel bike , I bought a hybrid ( the Cypress ) .I also started getting more addicted to this thing called bicycling and was riding 15 to 20 miles a day .Then I decided , maybe it would be nice to do one of those charity rides that I keep seeing on the flyers at the park .I started riding more miles on the hybrid but there just was n't any way that I was doing 50 to 100 miles on this thing .It 's a great bike , I still ride it a lot but it 's too heavy , the position is n't right for climbing some of the hills where these rides take place and I was always sore after long rides .So , back to the bike shop and I bring home the road bike .At first , I found myself riding the hybrid more than the road bike and was only riding the road bike when training for these distance rides .Now I find myself doing the opposite .Getting on a road bike one time and not really giving it a good ride is n't the best way to determine that you do n't want one .I was happy with the steel bike until the bug bit me .If you as much as think that you are going to get bit by the bug , seriously consider a road bike because if you start doing some serious riding , you are going to eventually get one .Just my experience .... got ta ' go and get ready for my Saturday ride .Taking the Defy .So far you have received what I would consider , some sage advice .Let me some up my version of the same message .IMHO a hybrid type bike is best for you until you get your skills back and your biking fitness up .Any bike style , a hybrid , a hard tail MTB or even a cross bike will do , I would strongly recommend a bike without a suspension fork .Find something that is comfortable and you feel stable on .Do n't be afraid to invest some money in it , get good components .If you make the right choice you will have this bike for a long time ( let 's call it N ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.266396"}

Nebraska .Especially these days .I know you have posted about moving in the past , but then again geographical cures usually only work temporarily in cases of panic attacks because the problem usually comes mostly from within .Depression could cause these attacks as well , but my shrink put me through me some depression tests and it was n't the root of my problem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.59285"}

{"text": "Left by New York Tourist on October 9th , 2008 .To readers : I understand that many of you live in tourist - y areas .I will be the first to admit that NYC and its inhabitants are different than any other city .After living here for two years , it takes a toll .I live here because I found a good job that pays well .I also live here because I love the big city and everything it has to offer - whether it be food , entertainment , or culture .However , when you live and work here , it can be exhausting .When MTA is doing track work on your subway line ( which mine has been doing for 9 months ) it makes for a bad morning .We look pissed off because often we are .It 's not an easy - going city to live in .It 's a tiny island crammed with 8 million people during the week .We all choose to live here , however , we do n't get to experience the great things the city has to offer on a daily basis , even on a monthly basis .We work , we try to get home to families , and we deal with the daily tolls of living in a big city .I 'm not saying that people living in other cities do n't experience the same thing , but there is something about NYC that hardens people .Everything is done in a rush .And it takes a certain person to be able to deal with it .I have plenty of friends who say , \" I do n't know how you live there , I could never do it .\" Once a year , I stay at a hotel in the city and go to Times Square and do tourist - y things that I would n't do and do n't have time to do on a regular basis .It 's a difficult lifestyle to explain .It 's why I choose to live in a small , yet bustling , neighborhood in Queens where I can get away from the city on the weekends .Left by cher on October 9th , 2008 .Wow ....I find it truly surprising that all of you think New Yorkers are hardened .Sure , sometimes we get irratable and seem mad at the world but honestly .... so do people all over .It 's just so much more obvious here because we are nt hiding in our cars ( cursing people out ) in private .Everything we do and say and feel here in this great and wonderful city is out there for everyone to see .No hiding emotions here !Hard to do when we spend our lives walking and taking public transportation .So while you may have to deal with tourists you do n't have to sidestep them on your way to the store or work or walking your dog !There is a big difference when you ca n't jump in your car , turn up the music and go .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.73541"}

{"text": "Going to therapy is a HUGE black mark on your record in this career field and would totally disqualify me for the rest of my life .The thing is I feel as though putting myself in this career will do more then anything else ever Could as far as ridding me of this damn mental curse .It is maddening to be stuck in such a mental prison and not being able to seek help , and a constant challenge as I tray , mostly in vein , to control my attacks .When I went through physical testing I thought my head was going to explode from trying to control my pounding heart and shaking hands .If anybody caught on I 'd be disqualified forever .They had to take my pulse 3 times because they thought something was wrong with my heart .Nothing I dohas ever helped .Sigh ...Mine also started suddenly after my fiance cheated on me .I believe this is the key to my issue as well as many others ... it is SELF ESTEEM .I 've had the same problems for the last ten years , mine were caused by an underlying heart problem .Mine started when I was 17 and my current doctor dismissed my concerns as anxiety due to my age .He did n't even consider the fact that I just had a child(yes , I know I was young ) .I had post - partum cardiomyopathy , and suffered for months because I trusted my doctor .I was given the go to have more children and two more babies later , I had a new heart problem .So after about a year of ativan(it stops working after a while if you do n't be careful , and the more you take the more you feel like you need it , so be careful ) , and anti - depressants , a mental health doctor .and all I needed was something for my heart .I feel you , but be mindful about your body and if something feels off , that you know is not a mental issue , get an MRI on your head or an electrocardigram .My second heart condition was not detectable by an EKG or an X - ray(which is usually what they will do at an ER ) .The problem that I had , was that a doctor instilled into my brain that I was suffering from a mental disorder , so that was what I told myself .Even when my chest hurt ( that can be a symptom of a panic attack ) .I was labeled as a person with a panic disorder , and then even after my diagnosis , I returned to the ER where I had went after I was properly diagnosed and was not given a fair look over .Finally , a doctor listened to my heart and hooked me up to a monitor and my pulse was about 200bpms , and was diagnosed with tachycardia and needed a beta - blocker instead of the benzo .It 's just important to listen to your body , because sometimes it is anxiety and that should be treated like a physical disorder because you suffer just as much as a person with any other kind of tangible(on paper ) problem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.74765"}

{"text": "So it came as a shock when the allure of a female voice was so addicting after being bombarded with male writing - in fact Lackey was the first female EF author I had ever read back when .It was a shock to read a book that actually had emotions and plots that worked with them .Of course the idea of mystical horses that can mind - link to humans and have the same intelligence ( if not smarter ) of their riders is any little or grown - up girls dream .The horses are mystical - maybe even divine - creatures that protect the kingdom in more ways then even their Heralds .Considering their Heralds act as enforcers of the law , spies , ambassadors , negotiators , warriors , assassins , and so much more - it 's pretty impressive .Talia comes from a repressive society of Holder Kin , that believe women are no better then housewives .The villages are basically polygamist settlements where women marry at thirteen , or are vowed into silence as priestesses .Talia is immediately relatable as a young girl who dreams of more and finds her escape in the few books that she can get her hands on .So when she 's confronted with an arranged marriage , I was only too willing to follow along Talia 's escape into the world of Heralds and Companions .Where outside of Holder Kin society women are equal to men .Lackey 's \" emo reputation \" probably comes from the fact that she is not afraid to deal with negative emotions .Talia has been repressed by her abusive upbringing , she suffers from low self - esteem and doubts .Heralds are asked to justly serve the kingdom and set aside personal feelings and prejudice .Talia is also Queen 's Own , which is a position as the main advisor and friend to the current ruler .Even though Talia 's Companion makes her Queen 's Own by picking her , this book is still a journey on Talia truly becoming a person to fit that role .Life - bonded couples - much like soul mates - are a favorite topic of negative opinions from other reviewers .While some characters state it was love at first sight , the relationships do n't start then .Lackey is all about character growth and nothing is ever easy , so do n't be afraid about mushy - gooey soul mates spoiling the storyline .Arrows of the Queen may only be a 230 page book , but it covers more story then most 700 page books .Lackey 's writing style is easy to get into , and is classy enough to forget the few typo issues at the beginning .Even though some characters do n't even get a page appearance , as they 're only brought up in conversation , you know who they are and what happens to them - even caring about them .This is my third time visiting this book , and it still manages to enchant me .It covers the training years of Talia , being the time honored tale of escape from the mundane lives we live to something incredible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.335106"}

{"text": "Yup , that makes /loads/ of sense ... .Given how often cops kill innocents , whether in outright murder , or just because they are recklessly incompetent and could n't hit a target if you put it a foot in front of them , there is no way to classify them as \" protective forces .\" Even in the rare event that there was some extremely - unlikely situation to which they could respond , odds are good that they 'd end up killing more innocents with stray fire than the actual terrorists would manage .yes , that was from Zaltieri 's map ( which is actually housed in Portland , Maine ) based on what Verrazano named it .But once the French settlements begain in 1604 the name was changed to L'Acadie which it has had since .While I 'm sure the opponents of these innovative safety measures mean well , their objections simply miss the bigger picture .Most small towns now have targeted kill lists .It 's perfectly legal .If one of these sniper teams had made a probable identification of a known person - of - interest , they would have had to make a split - second decision to kill him to protect the lives of the many children at PumpkinFest from imminent threat .When you consider that the alternative would be to deploy the B.E.A.R.C.A.T. , probably with an RPG - launcher , you can see that surgical , triangulated strikes from the rooftop safety - enforcers is the much better option .Yes , yes , I can already hear the bleeding hearts crying their eyes out about so - called \" innocent \" bystanders .Are you seriously suggesting that a terrorist is going to the Keene , NH pumpkin festival ?Are you also so unamerican that you feel a \" kill list \" is acceptable instead of a trial by a jury of one 's peers ?Keene is just an example of another tiny town with bored cops .Cops are humans , and they make mistakes .The mistake is a bit more final when firing into a crowded street at night rather than when chasing someone on the ground .Hell , even a tazer would be more acceptable .I 'm sorry but I can not let you get away with pushing this common myth that government agents \" are humans \" and that they \" make mistakes .\" It might be easy to pass that line off as true to the unreflecting listener , but a moment of examination will reveal the fallacy in that claim .But let 's not simply reason ourselves through this proof ( though I know libertarians are fans of the abstract logic thing ) .Let 's look through the only real window to truth : SCIENCE .There are numerous examples I can give , but just to give one , consider the exploration of the moon .If private persons were as capable as libertarians would have us believe , then private persons would have been able to travel to the moon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.643234"}

{"text": "Then your chest tightens up and it feels like your heart has just seized up and turned to stone .Except all that does n't matter to a person in the throes of an anxiety attack .No matter how much you know that you are not dying , it still feels like this is the end .I am going to die .DIE .Right here , right now .There is no way you can convince me that my untimely death is not imminent .Now imagine all this in Monday morning traffic on a busy road .I tried to conjure up all those exercises I learned over the past 25 years that help alleviate the attacks .Multiplication tables .But they just would n't come to me .Not even the simple two times tables .I concentrated on the song playing .Pushed the lyrics out of my mouth , which only wanted to form a small \" o \" , like the look of someone in a constant state of surprise .I sing , loud .Four months at sea , four months of calm seas only to be pounded in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point .I suck in air .In with the good , out with the bad , the mantra my religion teacher taught me in 12th grade when I confided to her that I started having panic attacks .I finally pull into the parking lot at work , I 'm early and the place is nearly deserted so no one sees me practicing some bizarre form of Lamaze breathing as I walk up the ramp and into the doors .My office is a safe place to continue on with the attack .Unlike being in my moving two ton car , going crazy while sitting in my office chair is n't going to result in harm to anyone else .It 's still quiet here .None of my bosses are in yet .I plug my iPod in , put on some calming music and forego the morning coffee in favor of a glass of cold water .The biggest myth about anxiety attacks is that the person suffering one has brought it on by thinking too hard about their problems .Mostly , they just come out of the blue .I rarely have suffered an anxiety attack while I was in the midst of wallowing in my problems .The anxiety always manifests itself later , at some unsuspecting time .Like 7:40 a.m. on a Monday morning on Hempstead Turnpike when the only thing I was thinking of - as I passed by Nassau Coliseum - was the fun I used to have going to Islander games .I do n't bother asking for help or telling anyone what 's going on because people who have never had an anxiety attack can not understand what goes on in a person 's brain when they are having one .A pat on the back and a \" stop worrying so much \" consolation does n't help .It 's not about worry .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.00537"}
