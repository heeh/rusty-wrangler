S. Senator Kelly Ayotte ( see multiplicity of links below ) was arrested by the Nashua Police Department in a prostitution sting .Usually a local prostitution arrest would not trigger national implications .But the \" secondary explosions \" following the arrest of local powerhouse David Wihby do have national implications for the 2016 presidential primary and perhaps even for primaries after that one .Allow me to explain .( I will also be providing coverage in greater depth on this issue during the next few days as we approach a \" First in the Nation \" presidential candidate event April 18 - 18 in - where else ? -Nashua .( Hopefully no candidate will be caught by the NPD 's \" Prostitution Squad \" during the \" FITN \" event . )I worked in the U. S. Senate and have been a follower of the senate and national politics for half a century .One of the cardinal rules for U. S. Senators is that they should not intrude in local politics and party primaries because such local meddling can cost them support and ultimately reelection .Ayotte has been a decent senator , not excellent but decent , but her lack of prior elected political experience and her constant meddling in New Hampshire GOP internal politics and primaries could cost her reelection in 2016 .In 2014 , Ayotte supported Horn 's maneuver to import an out - of - state candidate , Scott Brown , for the U. S. Senate .The tactic backfired .Conservatives rebelled .In late 2014 Ayotte again backed Horn during an internal battle over who would become speaker of the state house of representatives after Republicans took control in Concord in 2014 .The majority of the caucus supported State representative Bill O'Brien but Horn and Ayotte backed his opponent .O'Brien was stabbed in the back when the supporters of Horn and Ayotte supported an anti - O'Brien candidate for speaker , and the Democrats ended up choosing the speaker for a Republican majority .Understandably , O'Brien is still rankled by what happened only a few months ago .Horn has been attacking me since 2011 and so I have no more love for her than Bill O'Brien does .Earlier this week O'Brien issued an attack on Ayotte for her poor choice of senior staff member in Wihby .End of story ?Not at all .Horn then attacked O'Brien for attacking Wihby and herein lies the crux of the conflict for 2016 and thereafter .Horn likes to talk about \" party unity . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.463776"}
