' ' No , ' answered the young man .The elder said , ' Strike it harder , and at the same time revile , reproach , and slander it in the harshest way . 'When the youth returned , the old man asked , ' Did the post become angry ?Did it contradict or rebuke you , or complain ? ' 'No , Father , ' the youth said . 'How can a post lose its temper or say anything at all ?It is not alive . ' 'If you are able to imitate the post , never becoming annoyed or gainsaying when you are struck , ordered about , or reproved , but remaining untroubled by every sorrow , then stay and be my disciple , ' said the old man . 'Otherwise , do not darken my doorway with your shadow . 'Saint Melania built a beautiful church in the convent .Enshrined there were relics of the prophet Zacharias , Saint Stephen the proto martyr , and the Forty Martyrs of Sebasteia .After it was completed , her spiritual brother and former husband , the blessed Apinianus , departed unto the Lord , ending his God - pleasing life in the monastic habit .Melania gave him an honorable burial , then began preparing for her own death , which she expected would soon follow .Providence , however , deigned to prolong her life for the salvation of others .The saint expended her last funds on the construction of a monastery and became truly poor , having long before attained poverty of spirit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.87341"}
