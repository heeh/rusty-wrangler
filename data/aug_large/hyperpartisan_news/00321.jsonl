Bush .A large car bomb and weapons were confiscated .Saddam Hussein had vowed to assassinate Bush for his prosecution of the war .In early 1993 , Islamic extremists attempted to kill 250,000 people by toppling the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City .Ramzi Yousef , the leader of the group , claimed that the intent was to cause casualties on the order of the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima in order to punish the United States for its support and aid for Israel .But the car bomb , placed in the parking garage under one of the towers , did not topple them .( The perpetrators had considered augmenting the bomb with chemical or radiological agents that would have increased the casualties . )Later in 1993 , as a follow - up to the World Trade Center attack , the same group planned to assassinate Senator Al D'Amato of New York and destroy several New York landmarks in one day , but they were caught before they could carry out the plot .Yousef himself was arrested before he could carry out yet another plot to simultaneously bomb 12 jumbo jets and kill 4,000 passengers .In 1996 , Hezbollah of Saudi Arabia ( which differs from Hezbollah of Lebanon ) attacked the U.S. military apartment complex at Khobar Towers near Dhahran , Saudi Arabia .The attack killed 19 U.S. airmen and wounded 515 people .The perpetrators , rather than despising America per se , had a very specific , realpolitik goal : They wanted to compel the withdrawal of the U.S. military from Saudi Arabia .Also , in October 2003 , a U.S. diplomatic convoy was attacked in Gaza .Three U.S. security guards were killed .A day earlier , Israel had arrested suspects from a rogue Palestinian militant group .A senior U.S. official believed the attack on the convoy was motivated by growing anti - American resentment in Palestinian areas caused , in part , by U.S. policy in the region .My report also described several al - Qaeda - related attacks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.725815"}

{"text": "Yet the argument is wrong .Had people bothered to scratch below the surface , they would have seen warning signs that Bush 's aphorism was false and even dangerous .To start with , public opinion polls in Islamic nations repeatedly show that people in those countries actually admire America 's political and economic freedom .They also admire American wealth , technology , and even culture .So some other factor must be generating anti - U.S. hatred in these parts of the world .Furthermore , Bush 's grand plan to reduce terrorism by spreading freedom and democracy to Islamic nations -- thereby eliminating the hatred of such values -- is not based on any empirical evidence that oppression causes terrorism .Spreading democracy does n't reduce terrorism and , if anything , actually may make it worse .These data corroborate an earlier well - known study by William Eubank and Leonard Weinberg , professors at the University of Nevada , Reno , which found that most terrorist attacks happen in democracies -- with both the victims and the attackers usually being citizens of democracies .Gause also notes that recent elections and public opinion polls in Arab countries indicate that the advent of democracy would probably generate Islamic governments that would be much less likely to cooperate with the United States than their authoritarian predecessors .Those Islamic governments might also be more likely to sponsor terrorism .Iraq provides a current example of democratization leading to more terrorism .During the authoritarian reign of Saddam Hussein , Iraq provided some limited assistance to selected Palestinian groups attacking Israel , but did not fund groups that focused their attacks on the United States .Terrorism now runs rampant in a more democratic Iraq , which , according to the U.S. intelligence community , threatens to become an even more significant training ground for worldwide Islamist jihad than Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation .Finally , and most importantly , the evidence is startlingly clear that Bush 's war on terror has actually made things worse .According to the State Department 's data , the number of major terrorist incidents worldwide increased from 121 in 2001 to 175 in 2003 , a 21-year high .Then , in 2004 , the number skyrocketed to 655 significant attacks .Richard Clarke , the chief counterterrorism advisor to both Presidents Bill Clinton and Bush , has noted that terrorism in the three years after 9 - 11 exceeded that during the three years preceding it .If evidence indicates that Bush 's broadly constructed war on terror is counterproductive , what can be done to get better results ?To respond adequately to terrorism , the U.S. government and American people need to know why the terrorists are motivated to give up their time , money , and sometimes even their lives to attack the targets of a faraway land .To deny or delude ourselves about the true causes of such terrorism is dangerous .And the facts about terrorism lead us to the conclusion , controversial and difficult to accept as it may be , that the terrorists do n't hate the United States for \" what it is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.315445"}

{"text": "Probably there are complicating factors .I hope they will all be destroyed in the next few years .The thing is , if it is just about what weapons are on the chemical weapons schedules , it is n't a moral issue at all , because there is no moral distinction between scheduled chemical weapons and other deadly weapons .Part of the problem here is that hawks shift rationales constantly .\" It 's about the rule of law \" until you point out that they do n't favor consistent application of the rule of law .Then it becomes \" a moral issue \" until you point out that there 's no particularly persuasive moral distinctions here .I 'm also going to suggest that , if anything , the general lack of use of chemical weapons over the past 90 years mostly shows that chemical weapons are n't particularly useful .We went to war with Iraq because it invaded Kuwait and proceeded to not use chemical weapons .Nor did it use chemical weapons during the Gulf War .That , after then defeating Iraq , the international community then took steps against Saddam 's chemical weapons stockpile does not demonstrate that he was punished for using chemical weapons .And I do n't see why another state actor would think that this example would qualify as a warning that you 'll get punished by the international community for having chemical weapons .Saddam was punished by the international community for invading another sovereign state .The punishment , among other things , involved taking away his chemical weapons , but that was not a reason for what happened .Nonetheless , targeting and destroying Iraq 's chemical weapons was both a major goal of allied war planners , as well as the mission of an unprecedented UN effort in the aftermath of the war .All of this happened because of a war that , no , was not fought for the purpose of eliminating Saddam 's chemical weapons , but did so anyway .Wars often see their aims change mid - stream .The precipitating cause of the Gulf War need not have been chemical weapons related for it to have accomplished that end .And I do n't see why another state actor would think that this example would qualify as a warning that you 'll get punished by the international community for having chemical weapons .They would n't .The question here is why Saddam 's use of chemical warfare did n't wreck the norm and set off a reaction among neighbors .The answer is , because his weapons were taken care of in short order .There are two dynamics when it comes to preventing proliferation and the collapse of the norm : deterring countries that are just chomping at the bit to develop arsenals , and reassuring countries that do n't really want them that they do n't need to have a deterrent .With UNSCOM and the destruction of Saddam 's nbc programs / arsenal , I 'm talking about the latter .And for the third time , three years after that happened , a war that destroyed Saddam 's chemical weapons arsenal was launched , and a UN weapons team put into the country to root out and destroy his remaining stockpiles and programs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.24007"}

Bush , the subject of Stone 's scathing new biopic W. , but it 's an understatement to say they took divergent paths .While Bush enlisted in the Texas Air National Guard , Stone dropped out of school twice , then volunteered for Army combat duty in the Vietnam War , which he left with a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart .Stone 's Vietnam experience set the course for his filmmaking career , which has always been intensely political and provocative in its big - picture engagement with American life .After breaking through with his Oscar - winning screenplay for Midnight Express , Stone made the horror movies Seizure and The Hand , but the more he engaged in the key events of America 's past and present , the more respect he received .Rushed to release just before the 2008 presidential election , Stone 's latest film , W. , follows George W. Bush 's tragicomic journey from the frat - house to the White House , ending just before his 2004 reelection .Two days before its premi\u00e8re , Stone talked to The A.V.

Bush Be Tried for His War Crimes ? by Sheldon Richman , February 21 , 2011 .We should take a small measure of satisfaction in former President George W. Bush 's cancellation of his trip to Switzerland after human - rights groups threatened to bring legal action against him for authorizing torture .Persons detained by the U.S. government after 9/11 were subjected to what the Bush administration euphemistically called \" enhanced interrogation , \" including waterboarding .In reality those methods constituted torture , violating U.S. law and international agreements .Under those agreements charges can be filed against members of the Bush administration in jurisdictions outside the United States .The Center for Constitutional Rights along with European groups said they will ask Swiss authorities to initiate a criminal case against Bush .They also planned to file their own complaint .If all that Bush and members of his administration suffer for their crimes are travel restrictions , it will be a mild penalty indeed .( Alas , the U.S. government can and probably will obtain immunity for him . )They deserve far more , starting with a public criminal investigation in the United States , followed by trials .But President Obama says there will be no investigation of top officials .Wishing to \" look ahead , \" he has decided to treat Bush & Co. as above the law , embracing Richard Nixon 's maxim , When the president does it , it 's not illegal .In Germany that used to be known as the F\u00fchrer Principle .Many of us naively thought it was repudiated at the Nuremberg trials after World War II .How wrong we were .The stain that Bush and Obama have left on America wo n't fade anytime soon .It would have been bad enough to torture people actually suspected of wrongdoing , but the Bush administration went well beyond that .Many people subjected to hideous treatment were picked up on the flimsiest of \" evidence .\" People were offered bounties to turn others in ; naturally , some saw that as a chance to settle old scores having nothing to do with terrorism .Absence of evidence ( as former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld might say ) was not considered evidence of absence .In at least one case , a man was tortured - by the U.S. government 's helper in Egypt , Omar Suleiman - to get the prisoner to say that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had trained al - Qaeda agents .Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney badly wanted to justify their preexisting wish to effect regime change in Iraq by tying Saddam to 9/11 .But there was never any evidence of Iraqi complicity .That reminds us that torture was not the only crime committed by the Bush administration .The Iraq and Afghanistan wars were also ( and still are ) outrages because , among other reasons , they were based on lies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.089165"}

{"text": "Now , we have an overwhelming amount of debt and we can not really seem to get our economy back on its own feet and in full swing again .Therefore , some politicians including Ron Paul and some Libertarians have advocated that we return to the gold standard as a way to add value to our currency and to control our spending .This is because if the US dollar was on the gold standard , we would not have control over monetary policy .Now this seems like a great idea in theory but the practicality of it is just not there .The reason why we left the Gold Standard is that even back in 1971 there was not enough gold to back up the amount of currency we printed .After WWII , the US made all other countries tie their currencies to the US dollar , and then the US dollar would be tied to the gold standard .This way the US could help rebuild Europe and Asia without having to go through meaningless transfers .The US promised that any country who wanted to trade in US dollars could get the gold value of it .However , the rebuilding of the world took much more money than anyone had anticipated and the US printed trillions of dollars and gave it to countries .Charles De Gaulle , the leader of France , thought this was the US trying to influence every country so in 1971 he collected all the US currency in France and wanted to trade it in .The US in no way had enough gold to give Charles De Gaulle and that is when we left the gold standard .Therefore , think about it if we did not have enough gold back then to cover our checkbooks it would be impossible for us to cover what we now have spent .If we force ourselves to go back on the gold standard then we would really weaken the American dollar .Plus right now America only has $ 405 billion worth of gold in our reserve and therefore it is impossible for us to use this to cover our debt .Also another problem with the gold standard is that the value of the US dollar would be tied to the supply and demand of Gold and in the stock market gold is not as stable as one might assume .Also , if there is a shortage of gold than prices plummet hurting everyone and sending the country into another recession .This could happen if confidence in the American economy is shaken and too many people try to transfer their assets into gold at one time .Now there are some reasons why this is a good idea .First this would make it so the treasury could not just print trillions of dollars , or a trillion dollar Obama coin ( let 's not forget that was actually an idea ) , which some argue would force Congress to rein in spending .However , as we saw with the Fiscal Cliff , Congress does not seem to do well when they have a time limit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.0742"}

{"text": "It is important to understand that one reason Jeffrey Goldberg rejects the Lesser Islamophobia such as Pamela Geller 's silly \" stealth halal \" turkey nonsense is because , in his own words , \" Pamela Geller ... gives the fight against Islamist terrorism a bad name . \"In other words , the Lesser Islamophobia gives the Greater Islamophobia \" a bad name \" and might turn people away from bombing , invading , and occupying Muslim lands .We saw a similar dynamic earlier this year when Harry Reid , Lindsey Graham , and others suggested that formal action be taken against the Quran - burning Florida preacher Terry Jones .Jones was vilified as an Islamophobic bigot ( and there is no doubt that he is one ) , whose ( Lesser ) Islamophobia was supposedly placing U.S. troops in Afghanistan at risk .Yet , these same individuals are among the greatest defenders of the Greater Islamophobia , which is the real cause behind Muslim anger : the bombing , invading , and occupying of Muslim lands .In fact , their opposition to Pastor Jones was that he was making it more difficult to sustain the military campaign against Muslims .As Salon 's Glenn Greenwald wrote : .[ T]here is an extreme irony in Harry Reid and Lindsey Graham , of all people , suddenly worrying about actions that trigger anger and violence in the Muslim world .Similarly , war - cheerleading journalist Jeffrey Goldberg supports the Supreme Tenet of Islamophobia : seemingly endless war against the Muslim world .Even before the blood of Afghan and Iraqi citizens dried from the American sword , U.S. war rhetoric against two other Muslim countries - Iran and Pakistan - has ratcheted up .Just like in the lead up to the Iraq War , the Jeffrey Goldbergs of the mainstream media have been furiously at work making the case for war .To understand the war - obsessed brain of Jeffrey Goldberg it would be worthwhile to look back to his 2008 article Re - Thinking Jeffery Goldberg .In it , he reveals the interesting fact that not even Jeffrey Goldberg can keep track of how many Muslim countries Jeffrey Goldberg has called to attack .He writes : .Last year ...I called for the immediate invasion of Yemen ( or possibly Oman ) ... .Was it Yemen or Oman ?Goldberg ca n't remember - surely , we ca n't expect him to remember such a long list of countries to invade .The article reveals how flippantly Goldberg discusses such matters ; it 's just table talk for him .Bomb Yemen ?Oman ?Iraq ?Iran ?They all sound so similar !The link between Zionism and Islamophobia has been investigated before ; the connection between Zionism and warmongering is even clearer .So , it is no surprise that Jeffrey Goldberg is a war - cheerleader .The Institute for Policy Studies calls him \" a hawkish ' pro - Israel ' commentator [ ] \" whose \" articles have often seemed to parallel efforts by hawks to push the United States into war . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "133.81296"}
{"text": "The reason for this , is the government has outlawed communication between bureaucratic agencies , because if they communicated , government would be getting too big .What is worse is neither of these agencies actually could shut down the factory .They could only issue warnings saying there was an infection in the plant and it was up to the plant to shut itself down and fix the problem .Of course this only occurred after three people were killed .After this case the CDC and FDA both asked Congress for the ability to fine or temporarily shut down factories that were being investigated and after several months of battle in Congress , Congress passed a law that ended the requirement for inspectors to go to meat packing factories .And no that is not a typo the law they passed did not regulate the meat packing agencies at all .What is worse is in 2011 another listeria outbreak in cantaloupes killed 30 people with 146 confirmed cases in total .Of course no major legislation was passed to end stop this from happening again .The reason why this all matters is because if agencies are performing the exact same tests and neither can actually do anything with the information they gain from it what are we spending millions of dollar on .Plus the US budget is distributed through the bureaucracy , so if they have little practical power that can be used without legislation than why are they getting the money .Now in this post I have laid out the arguments for what is wrong with our bureaucracy and government pork - barrel legislation .However , both of these issues have simple solutions .First of all with the bureaucracy , give them power is the simple way of putting it .Give the FDA and CDC the power to put companies temporarily out of business , I mean the FAA ( Federal Aviation Administration ) only got power after the Patriot Act was passed after 9/11 .Also if you simplify the bureaucracy and even try to end overlapping of responsibilities and allow communication .The CDC and FDA both deal with diseases , drugs , and outbreaks , why ca n't they work together if they are investigating the same thing .Fear of a tyrannical government is not insane but if giving into this fear threatens the safety and security of innocent people do we want it to be the defining characteristic of our government .And for pork - barrel legislation , is it necessary to give $ 750,000 to a brewery .Who does that benefit other than the brewery .Some things should not be a problem but the only issue is even though everyone said they would stop adding pork to bills they still continue to do it .The only solution is for people to stop expecting money from their representatives if we care more about the overall good for the country rather than the money in our pocket Congress will stop sending money directly home .Overall the solution is truly for Congress to follow through on their promises or to stop hiding pork as amendments onto legislation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "134.60516"}
