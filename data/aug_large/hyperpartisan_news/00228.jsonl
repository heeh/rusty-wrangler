Trey Gowdy , R - S.C. , chairman of the immigration subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee .Advocates on all sides of the immigration - reform issue credit the young immigrants themselves with playing a crucial role in the dramatic shift by GOP leaders .\" I think the dream movement has been incredibly effective , \" said Roy Beck , of NumbersUSA , which opposes citizenship for most undocumented immigrants but is willing to consider an exception for dreamers .\" They have the most compelling case for amnesty , \" Beck said .\" If we did n't have the dreamers , I do n't think we would have any push at all on immigration . \"Although the fate of immigration reform this year is in question , it is clear that House GOP leaders have changed their minds on citizenship for dreamers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.19165"}

'In 1950 when my parents set foot off the boat onto Ellis Island , with two babies and not a dime to spend , they did so because they had a DREAM of a better life for their children .The same DREAM that thousands upon thousands of young DREAMers have today . 'The Franciscan Action Network will stand with the DREAM Coalition and the young DREAM Act students in the spirit and tradition of St Francis until they have the opportunity to fulfill their DREAMS .\" - Patrick Carolan , Executive Director , Franciscan Action Network .\" By voting against the DREAM Act , forty - one Senators , who have all met students who would benefit from the DREAM Act , have voted against youth , against immigrants and new Americans , against the wishes of the faith community and the future of this country .On Saturday , many Senators extolled the virtues of the DREAM Act , but claimed to be voting against it due to procedural matters .For us at Church World Service , the future of these children and students will always trump procedure and partisan politics .We pledge to continue to support and stand in solidarity with the courageous youth across the country .As a nation , we can only benefit from these students ' fortitude and character .We ask the forty - one Senators who on Saturday denied these students their DREAM to look inward , finally put aside their politicking and work with these students , the faith community and others to enact the DREAM Act and other immigration reforms as soon as possible .These reforms , senators , can not wait . \" - Erol Kekic , Director , Immigration and Refugee Program , Church World Service .\" The Senate 's vote to block passage of the DREAM Act raised bullying behavior to a new level in our nation .By targeting children who were brought to the U.S. by their undocumented immigrant parents and by denying those children the opportunity to earn citizenship through hard work and sacrifice , legislators have embarrassed themselves and our nation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.673416"}
{"text": "A dream of freedom , of opportunity , the belief that if you put in the hard work you could be anything you wanted to be , that you could achieve anything .It was that dream that inspired waves of migration , that brought so many to build railroads and work the fields , that drove so many to join the beautiful diversity that helps make the United States the country that it is today .It was that dream of opportunity that awakened the desire of parents to bring their small children , seeking to give them a better life .These children who were too young to make that choice themselves , who grew up here , undocumented , we call Dreamers .And in a way it is that same Dream that fuels our struggle for the DREAM Act today .Dreamers too have had to seek the land of opportunity where they live , where they might have grown up but where their fulfillment has been denied for too long .Dreamers have inspired me as they have inspired so many because they embody the struggle to belong , to grow , to achieve and to give back as much as they possibly can .Through education and their desire to work Dreamers not only better themselves but the country they grew up in , the land they love .When this nation opens its arms to Dreamers , it 's getting closer to a more complete fulfillment of its fundamental promise .It is this embrace that brings us closer to a more perfect union , a nation with an arc bending towards justice .So I am happy for the Dreamers , I am happy as an immigrant , but I am also happy as a United States citizen .Belonging to this generous , diverse nation is a privilege that Dreamers deserve , and I am proud of our President protecting Dreamers from deportation , hopefully until the day that they too can become citizens themselves .President Obama knows how deeply the dreamer struggle is bound to the fabric of the nation .He 's said that this is only a first , necessary but temporary step .And like so many of us , believes congress must pass the DREAM Act which offers a path to citizenship .The President and a majority of Democrats support us in our efforts to achieve a comprehensive immigration reform that is humane and practical .We will not surrender that goal , that dream .Yes , this is a first step , but it changes everything .It is through such steps that we will make our way ahead .So I ask of you , will you take these steps with us ?We 're marching together into the light .Dream to Belong -The complete song in support of the DREAM Act , dedicated to all the Dreamers and in memory of Dreamer Joaquin Luna .Full credits here .Any society can only benefit from its struggle to overcome prejudice , selfishness and xenophobia , and every person can only grow from attempting to become more inclusive and compassionate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.1277"}
