'Cancer as a justification to play dirty .That does n't sound good Raph .Reading all these comments , I get the feeling we are now seeing the damage that Lance , unintentionally , has done : those who identified and believed in him and the Livestrong message , now seek to protect their beliefs and the good it has done for them .Each in his own way , but not few impress me with an emotional sense of denial .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "135.31062"}

FIGHT LIKE HELL .Now patients not only wish to defeat their cancers but they want to climb Mount Kilimanjaro , run marathons , complete Iron Mans ...They want to conquer their fears and defeat the odds .Lance may have been dirty , but then so is cancer .You have to fight dirty to win a dirty fight .You have to be ruthless and you have to FIGHT LIKE HELL .Looking at these comments I 'm so disgusted that I think maybe Lance 's fighting rhetoric was actually worse than his doping use .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "136.50397"}
