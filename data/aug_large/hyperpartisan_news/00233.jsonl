{"text": "CARRIE JOHNSON , BYLINE : In Washington scandals , the question is usually what the White House knew .But in the case of former Central Intelligence Director David Petraeus , lawmakers are asking why President Obama did not know about a federal investigation that had found evidence Petraeus was having an affair .Peter King is a Republican U.S. House member , from New York .Here he is , on MSNBC .( SOUNDBITE OF MSNBC BROADCAST ) .JOHNSON : Matthew Miller worked as a top aide to Attorney General Eric Holder at the Justice Department .He could n't disagree more .MATTHEW MILLER :If the Justice Department is investigating a member of the administration , they do n't want to notify other people in the administration .In fact , if they had notified the White House while this investigation was ongoing , you 'd hear howls from members of Congress that the investigation might have been politicized .JOHNSON :There 's another reason for not sharing leads more widely , Miller says .Sometimes , the FBI investigates , and the allegations do n't pan out - or they do n't merit any criminal charges .Law - enforcement sources tell NPR , that appears to be the case here .The White House says Mr. Obama was first briefed on the case last Thursday , even though federal investigators started looking into what would become the Petraeus case , about six months ago .The FBI probe started with a woman in Florida , who socializes with the Petraeus family .She told a friend in the bureau , she had received some bothersome email messages .Investigators traced the messages to Paula Broadwell , author of a biography of Petraeus .And in an email account , the FBI found communications that depicted an affair between the two .Senior Justice Department officials were alerted in the late summer - before FBI agents interviewed key players , in September and October .The last interview was within days of the election .Former CIA Director Michael Hayden told Fox News , he still has lots of questions .( SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST ) .MICHAEL HAYDEN : It 's mysterious .I really do n't have insight into it .It appears that the bureau was balancing the law - enforcement process , the privacy of some individuals involved .But hanging out there is that requirement , in law , to keep the intelligence committees fully and currently informed about significant intelligence activities .JOHNSON :That requirement is found in the National Security Act , and in an executive order on U.S. intelligence activities that dates back to the Ronald Reagan era .Law - enforcement officials say they did n't tell Congress because Petraeus was a witness - not a target - in an ongoing criminal investigation .And until very recently , agents were still trying to figure out whether anyone broke any laws .Under Justice Department guidelines , authorities are barred from sharing information even with most people in the White House , unless there 's a national security exception .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.31098"}

Kennedy was forced to assure Protestants that the pope would n't be calling the shots on American foreign and domestic policy in his administration .You channeling Ernie now Eric , along with boxes of rocks and turnip trucks ?Your last post just verified my point .I already showed that Kennedy was mentioned in those articles as just a particular incident in a long long history of religious involvement in US politics .Not a uniquely significant one .You just reiterated my point by pasting those texts .Nothing is mentioned anywhere about the BS you made up about rock music , radicals , or radical movies(or sex or drugs either ) .It ai n't all about the 60's-70 's that egocentric narcissistic baby boomers see as the wellspring for everything .its mostly about shifts in evangelical theology concerning what are proper concerns in this life as preparation and qualification for afterlife .Really Eric , I think you 're getting stupider and stupider lately .As well as more and more conservative .Your writing that mentally ill people are ' lesser ' in the Occupy Eureka thread on Hank 's blog clearly showed you 've taken up a lot of the rightwing the kool aid .Has SoHum really shifted that far so quickly ?NAN - Apparently you 're a little embarrassed , and you 're changing the subject , though I 'm not clear on your new subject .Originally you said : .Eric 's history is all screwed up .The facts of what actually happened were discussed by scholars on PBS 's Religion in America series and have everything to do with factions within the Christian evangelical movement and nothing to do with Catholics .Of course , Eric 's personal knowledge is rooted indoctrinated Catholic dogma .In his narcissistic myopia he sees his own individual experience as being the basis of explanation for everything .Along with smatterings of childhood family stories that he often cites as prima facie wisdom of the ages .I did not suggest that Kennedy was addressing those issues , but reacting to hysteria which was amplified by the brief revival of political religion .The brief 50s revival of political religion is covered in great detail by historians from Sydney Allstrom to C. Vann Woodward , both in a long list .It had become dormant after its standard bearer William Jennings Bryan was destroyed ( literally and figuratively ) by the Scopes Monkey Trial .The point is , this is really basic history , without much dispute .In fact , the only dispute would really come from right wing revisionists who want to downplay their predecessors ' opposition to Hollywood , Elvis , etc . .And I did not write that mentally ill people are \" lesser .\" Go back and try to employ a fifth grade reading level to the post , and maybe you 'll comprehend it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.81666"}
