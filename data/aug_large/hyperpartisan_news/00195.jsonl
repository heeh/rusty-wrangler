Mohammed and the Islamic Center ( now known as Masjid Bilal ) which was known as \" the immigrant masjid . \"Today there are around 25 or more masjids in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area .The first two new masjids were Dar al Islam and Masjid at - Taqwa wa - Jihad .Two different masjids , with two different demographics in two entirely different communities .Dar al Islam was opened by the Islamic Foundation in the affluent western suburbs of St. Louis far from the city .From the old mosque of the foundation , Masjid Bilal ( in Midtown St. Louis NOT downtown as some incorrectly say ) , it is around two hours on public transportation .The resources of the Foundation immediately went to the western suburbs and became unavailable to those without the wealth to live in the western suburbs .This occurred at a time when more than one - fifth of the buildings in St. Louis were vacant .Houses were being sold for a few hundred dollars and sometimes even less .For the cost of purchasing the land and building a masjid in West St. Louis County Muslims could 've literally built an entire neighborhood in the city of St. Louis with a masjid , school , housing and retail .The choice to go to West St. Louis County mimicked the white - flight pattern that began in St. Louis in the 1950 's .In 1950 St. Louis city had over 800,000 residents .Today the city has just over 300,000 while 2.5 million are in the Metropolitan area .There are many factors for the loss of population in the city ; but the biggest is the desegregation of city schools and neighborhoods which led to white - flight .The same is the case in many cities across America .When asked why new masjid projects are n't being undertaken in cities for the most part Muslim leaders point to crime and schools .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.32978"}

{"text": "Obama 's Inaugural Address laid out an expansive progressive agenda that was focused heavily on civil rights and rooted in the founding values of the country .His State of the Union speech was Chapter Two of this story .It laid out a progressive economic blueprint that was focused heavily on nuts - and - bolts policy ideas and rooted in a much more basic call for economic fairness , shared sacrifice in bringing down the deficit , and aggressive government action to help struggling Americans gain access to the middle class .Obama - having been lifted to reelection by an ascendant majority coalition of minorities , young voters , and college educated whites , mostly women - gave very little ideological ground to his opponents .His speech built on the Inaugural address in the sense that it continued to reshape the conversation around the priorities of these core groups - only with a more direct focus on the economy .The biggest news in the speech was the call for Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $ 9.00 an hour .But the most important ideological moment in the speech came when he challenged the idea that reducing the deficit is good for the economy and renewed the push for more stimulus spending .\" Let 's be clear : Deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan , \" Obama said .\" It 's not a bigger government we need , but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad - based growth .\" We needed Obama to renew the case for more stimulus spending - while skewering the idea that reducing the deficit alone is good for the economy .As unlikely as it is that this Congress will agree to any more stimulus , it was important to hear Obama make this case .The other newsmaking moment - working with states to make pre - school available to every child in America - was similarly cast as an important step in securing future economic security for the middle class .Obama 's vow to use executive action to combat climate change in the face of Congressional dithering was a similarly aggressive challenge to Republicans .Ultimately , though , the great amount of emotional weight Obama brought to the call for sensible gun reform was in many ways the most arresting moment of the evening .Clinton exhorted Republicans : \" I challenge all of you in this Chamber : Never , ever shut the federal government down again .\" The historical circumstances are different , but the message to Republicans is the same : Do n't allow ideological radicalism to get in the way of common sense , collective action on behalf of the American people .In the end , the policy heavy nature of this State of the Union hearkens back to another element of Clinton 's SOTU speeches .Those were premised on the notion that Americans want policy - they want to hear their president spell out , in as much detail as possible , where he wants to take the country .The realities of Congressional opposition to Obama 's agenda remain very real , and it still remains to be seen what Obama and Dems are prepared to give away to secure a deal to bring down the deficit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.76172"}

Barack Obama said yesterday at a town hall meeting in Fairfax County that if elected president , he would bolster the economy by helping working mothers .It was his second visit to the area since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee and occurred on a day when his likely Republican foe was also reaching out to Northern Virginia voters .In the packed gymnasium at Robinson Secondary School , Obama told more than 2,000 supporters that as president he would work to expand paid family and medical leave , child - care services and preschool programs .These initiatives could be paid for in large part by ending the Iraq war , he said .Obama also spoke briefly of the significance of his return to Virginia less than two months after he launched his general election campaign at a rally of 10,000 supporters at Nissan Pavilion in Prince William County .It is wonderful to be back in Virginia , \" he said to thunderous applause .\" We did well in the primary election in Virginia , and we want to do well in the general election .Sen. John McCain , who spent the day in Michigan and Minnesota , also spoke to Northern Virginia voters yesterday , in a telephone conference .And immediately after Obama 's speech , a group of Republican women , including Susan Allen , wife of former governor and U.S. senator George Allen , assailed Obama for endorsing a plan that the women said would cause taxes to rise , hurting middle - class families .The events yesterday underscored Virginia 's significance in the fall election .Although the state has backed the Republican in every presidential contest for the past four decades , the state is widely considered to be up for grabs .Both candidates have been airing television ads in Virginia and have opened multiple field offices in the state .The Illinois Democrat benefits from the state 's sizable African American population and his personal friendship with Democratic Gov. Timothy M. Kaine , whose wife , Anne Holton , accompanied Obama to the podium yesterday and delivered introductory remarks .Obama 's campaign also expects to draw strength from a swelling , shifting Northern Virginia electorate that has helped usher a string of Democrats to victory in the state .Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairman Gerald E. Connolly ( D ) , who is running for Congress and spoke before Obama yesterday , said his populous , blue - tinged county could lead Virginia to support a Democrat for president for the first time since 1964 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.87865"}
