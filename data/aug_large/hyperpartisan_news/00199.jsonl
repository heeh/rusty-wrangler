Merck CEO Resigns as Drug Probe Continues House Panel Critical Of Vioxx Sales Tactics .By Marc Kaufman Washington Post Staff Writer Friday , May 6 , 2005 .Merck & Co. 's longtime leader Raymond V. Gilmartin abruptly resigned yesterday on the same day congressional investigators released a slew of documents detailing how the company continued to aggressively promote its arthritis drug Vioxx after it knew of potentially serious safety concerns .The documents made public by the House Committee on Government Reform showed that Merck directed its 3,000-person Vioxx sales force to avoid discussions with doctors about the cardiovascular risks identified in a major clinical trial of the drug in 2000 .Sales representatives were told instead to rely on a \" Cardiovascular Card \" that said Vioxx was protecting the heart rather than potentially harming it .Vioxx was withdrawn from the market last September after another clinical trial found that people who had taken the drug for 18 months were five times more likely to have heart attacks and strokes than those on a placebo .The withdrawal tarnished Merck 's reputation and cost the firm billions in sales , stock value and legal fees .The company , which had earlier said Gilmartin , 64 , would stay in place until his scheduled retirement next year , said his sudden departure as chairman , president and chief executive officer had nothing to do with the Vioxx controversy .Merck named its president for manufacturing , Richard T. Clark , to replace Gilmartin as chief executive officer and president .The resignation of Gilmartin , after he spent 11 years at the helm , came on a day when Merck was sharply criticized in a hearing into how the company and the Food and Drug Administration had handled the safety concerns surrounding Vioxx .Merck and other drug companies say their \" detailers \" act as neutral educators to guide physicians in prescribing drugs , but the more than 20,000 pages of documents released yesterday showed that Merck 's representatives were coached to be aggressive salesmen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.19107"}

's longtime leader Raymond V. Gilmartin abruptly resigned yesterday on the same day congressional investigators released a slew of documents detailing how the company continued to aggressively promote its arthritis drug Vioxx after it knew of potentially serious safety concerns .The documents made public by the House Committee on Government Reform showed that Merck directed its 3,000-person Vioxx sales force to avoid discussions with doctors about the cardiovascular risks identified in a major clinical trial of the drug in 2000 .Sales representatives were told instead to rely on a \" Cardiovascular Card \" that said Vioxx was protecting the heart rather than potentially harming it .Vioxx was withdrawn from the market last September after another clinical trial found that people who had taken the drug for 18 months were five times more likely to have heart attacks and strokes than those on a placebo .The withdrawal tarnished Merck 's reputation and cost the firm billions in sales , stock value and legal fees .The company , which had earlier said Gilmartin , 64 , would stay in place until his scheduled retirement next year , said his sudden departure as chairman , president and chief executive officer had nothing to do with the Vioxx controversy .Merck named its president for manufacturing , Richard T. Clark , to replace Gilmartin as chief executive officer and president .The resignation of Gilmartin , after he spent 11 years at the helm , came on a day when Merck was sharply criticized in a hearing into how the company and the Food and Drug Administration had handled the safety concerns surrounding Vioxx .Merck and other drug companies say their \" detailers \" act as neutral educators to guide physicians in prescribing drugs , but the more than 20,000 pages of documents released yesterday showed that Merck 's representatives were coached to be aggressive salesmen .They were trained how to smile , speak and position themselves most effectively when talking with doctors , and were exhorted to sell Vioxx and other Merck drugs using the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 's \" I Have a Dream \" speech .Rep. Elijah E. Cummings ( D - Md . ) read from a Merck training manual that directed instructors to play a recording of the speech and then say to the sales force : \" King was someone with goal - focus - he kept getting shut down but kept going . . . .Just as with a physician , you must keep repeating the compelling message and at some point , the physician will be ' free at last ' when he or she prescribes the Merck drug , if that is most appropriate for the patient . \" \" Merck says the mission of its sales force is to educate doctors , \" said Rep.

{"text": "The title itself exposes its not altogether subtle goal of pinning much of European anti - Semitism and the Holocaust on a Palestinian Arab nationalist and a Muslim religious leader , the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem named Haj Amin al - Husseini .This man worked for Nazi Germany as a propagandist and a recruiter of Bosnian Muslim volunteers for the Waffen SS and other units in the Balkans .But surely that is evidence . . .evidence of what ?Let 's put this man 's involvement on the battlefield at the far margins of this war in perspective .The Holocaust was carried out by German soldiers , officials , and civilians , from clerks and officials in the government to units of the army , the police , and the SS .In fact , Arab immigrants from North Africa were rounded up as well and killed in the gas chambers .The Nazis also sought to enlist the support of all the states they occupied in rounding up the undesirables for the gas chambers .This chart offers the actual figures for what countries bore responsibility for sending Jews to their deaths in the Holocaust .The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem 's total was zero .So if any group is to be hated and held morally responsible for the Holocaust , why search the margins of the Nazi German coalition for a culprit , when all the world knows what really happened .The reason the Europeans were so readily forgiven is a matter of finances .Israel desperately needed the reparations coming from Germany after the war to establish itself on a sound economic footing .It 's amazing how quickly the Zionists forgave the actual perpetrators of the Holocaust , and projected their rage onto the people that they are doing everything in their power to get rid of .America has to decide whether racism is a legitimate political platform or an ugly moral failing .If the former , then Saturday Night Live ( SNL ) has done the right thing by inviting Donald Trump to be a guest on the show .But if the latter is the case , then SNL should not only disinvite this presidential candidate embraced by a disintegrating GOP , but also apologize to the American public for this moral lapse .There is nothing funny about a white billionaire who believes the President of the United States is a Muslim imposter .Nor is it humorous to have a presidential candidate strutting around the country , calling Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers .To try to make this man funny is to make his hateful views an acceptable twist in mainstream political discourse .The United States has a \" dixiecrat \" problem , which is a sordid , lingering consequence of slavery .It is a solid bloc of Southerners who call themselves conservatives and even evangelical Christians .But they are in fact bigots , who switched political allegiances from Democratic to Republican , enraged with civil rights legislation , and hoping to bolster Richard Nixon 's presidential campaign .Under the awning of the Tea Party they are destroying the Republican Party , and have already incapacitated the GOP - controlled House of Representatives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.10722"}
{"text": "To make matters better , Ethan actually happens to be a Virginian .I poured him a glass of this mystery wine and stepped back to see what would happen .One sniff and he started swooning over what he surmised to be one of his treasured white Burgundies .\" This is in the Montrachet style , \" he said .\" Very Burgundian .\" Then a sip .\" No , not just the style .This is Burgundy .You ca n't get this minerality anywhere else . \" In his defense , he wondered for a moment how the nose of a wine with such minerality could be so fresh and lively .\" Am I making a fool of myself ? \" he asked .But then he fell right back into the seduction of thinking he was drinking a lovely Burgundy , with just enough age on it for some complexity to be beginning to show .I tell this story not to bury Ethan , but to praise him .Really .He stuck his nose in a glass , identified all sorts of Burgundian components , put the pieces of the puzzle together , and called it Burgundy .That 's the way blind tasting is supposed to work , at least when you 're good at it .As it happened , this wine was n't Burgundy .But that was n't Ethan 's fault .I have plans to cook dinner for the wine importer Eric Solomon , and his wife , winemaker Daphne Glorian of Clos Erasmus , when they pass through Colorado this week .The invitation I extended was that I 'd grill some buffalo steaks and open half a dozen different bottles from my cellar .My thought had been to serve the wines blind - and perhaps even include one of the wines that Solomon imports in hopes of getting him to say something provocative about it .But , funny thing , after blind - tasting Ethan on the Linden I found I 'd lost the taste for that .See , I 'd assumed that when Ethan learned that the wine he 'd tried was n't Burgundy at all but a modest Chardonnay made an hour 's drive from his home in Charlottesville , he 'd be overjoyed .What could be better than to find a source of Burgundy - faux though it may be - on your doorstep ?But it turned out that he was n't overjoyed .In fact , he was mortified .In an instant , the accumulated knowledge of two decades of thinking about and drinking good wine was called into question .Ethan was a big enough man to admit that he loved the wine just as much as a Virginia Chardonnay as he had when it was Puligny - Montrachet .But the whole experience was n't nearly as positive as it might have been had I poured the wine in plain sight and allowed us to discover this amazing little wine together .I suppose it made him feel slightly fraudulent , as though he has been drinking expensive French wine all these years when it turns out he could n't tell the difference between that and a cheap bottle from Virginia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.47915"}
