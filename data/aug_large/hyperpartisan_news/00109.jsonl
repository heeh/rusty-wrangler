IMPRESSIVE North Korea tests it 's first Submarine launched ballistic missile .published : 25 Nov 2015 .views : 42967 .In a surprise move North Korea tested it\\ 's first submarine launched ballistic missile off the coast of North Korea .A ballistic missile is a missile ( rocket ) that follows a ballistic trajectory with the objective of delivering one or more warheads to a predetermined target .This contrasts to a cruise missile which is aerodynamically guided in powered flight .Long range intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBM ) are launched at a steep , sub - orbital flight trajectory and spend most of their flight out of the atmosphere .Shorter range ballistic missiles stay within the Earth\\ 's atmosphere .History[edit ] Rockets have been used as weapons for a long time ( see History of rockets ) .A pioneer ballistic missile was the A-4,[1 ] commonly known as the V-2 rocket , developed by Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s under direction of T.J. Gertner and Wernher von Braun .The first successful launch of a V-2 was on October 3 , 1942 , and began operation on September 6 , 1944 , against Paris , followed by an attack on London two days later .By the end of World War II , May 1945 , over 3,000 V-2s had been launched .The R-7 Semyorka was the first Intercontinental ballistic missile .A total of 30 nations have deployed operational ballistic missiles .Development continues , with around 100 ballistic missile flight t ..
