{"text": "One of the major problems I see is much talk around privilege seems to take the above statement - which I would argue is fairly obvious and should be non - controversial - to embrace a radical subjectivism that is untenable and contradictory .Whilst the disproportionate number of black people in prison must partly be due to racism I think it is sloppy and incorrect the way most people on the left ( both moderate & extreme ) declare this inequality as unarguable evidence of a racist status quo .I think this issue is far more complicated than that and blaming it on racist police , courts , law makers & institutions misses the point .Not only is it wrong to simplify this issue as one of racist oppression , that narrative only serves to feed more young black men into the teeth of the prison system by reinforcing a sense of hopeless victimhood .The disparity in prison populations is almost universal from Los Angeles to London , from American states where most judges and a large proportion of cops are black to British and European justice systems which are steeped in human rights legislation .The geographical location , laws and ethnic backgrounds of the officials differ yet almost universally , in the West black people are being jailed far too much .There are many potential reasons for this other than racism ; from poverty to a belief that the system is racist -therefore crime is the only option- to the hyper masculinity and gang culture which I believe springs from the oppressed / oppressor narrative .I have some experience of this having been on the wrong side of the law myself .In my experience the reason why arrest rates are higher among people of colour has a lot more to do with the choices being made than evil racist cops arresting innocent black guys for fun .One point which is often raised as incontrovertible proof of racism is why the sentencing disparity ?If the system is n't racist why do black guys who get caught with drugs face longer sentences than white guys , why are black youths targeted by the police more than white youths when white people are just as likely to be sniffing coke or smoking dope ?It 's a bloody good point and on the face of it it seems like the only answer can be that Western police forces and criminal justice systems are racist and rotten to the core right ?I disagree !As with most things in life things are far more nuanced .In my opinion the answer to this question ( whilst unfair ) is simple .Violence and gang culture !Whilst there are some seriously dangerous white drug dealers and some harmless pot smoking black kids the likelihood that a white drug offender will have a violent gang affiliation is much less likely than the black drug offender .So whilst I agree that racism plays a role I know that it 's the choices people make that matter as to whether one goes to prison or not .As long as we focus solely on the bogeyman of institutional racism the choices which lead so many of our young black men into the prison system are neglected .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.65088"}

{"text": "So what is it ?My argument hits on what Gibbs notes as the defining characteristic of this generation : mobile social computing .One of the key attractions of the church in past generations -- social connection -- has been effectively replaced .10 thoughts on \" More on How Facebook Killed the Church \" .This whole business about social networking and community is fascinating to me and I wonder if it might not push on what we mean by church in the first place .Your posts certainly point , I think , to the inadequacy of church defined by voluntary association verses the church as an eschatological people living intentionally around a peculiar story .The first sees the church as a support group , the second as the necessary environment for the ecology of the Kingdom of God .I think , if the second is the case , then social networking might not kill the church but aid its appearing in new ways .I also think that the reason younger people are seeing no use for church is more complex than the lack of need for the social networking congregations once provided .While in some ways younger generations are more conservative , in other ways they are not .Their views on social justice , homosexuality , etc , are more liberal than most traditional churches .There is a principled reaction against religion as well .While I think their values are more traditional in some ways , we live in a post - beauracratic culture where hope is no longer expressed through institutions , as the study you cite also suggests .In other words , part of what they might be rejecting is that church served its parents primarily as a means of social networking .Social media is certainly a part of of this mix .It might be interesting to ask if social media has reduced connectivity of people who do value their congregational experience .My sense is that it has n't .I 'm wondering if the same kind of study you did with student retention might also be true of church .I 'm wondering , in other words , if facebook participation makes persons more likely to stick with a congregation .I think it might .I know I feel more connected to the congregations I 'm associated with because of facebook .I think the relationship might be amplification as much as it is creation / destruction .The web amplifies our commitments .One of the questions I have is does the proliferation of discourse on the web function more to open us to new commitments or move us to greater entrenchment around the values we already have .Researchers are torn about this .Some see twitter and other innovations as the technology necessary for Habermas ' ideal communication to find fruition .I 'm far less optimistic .We read some of the major lit on this in a seminar I took on gospel and cultures last spring .I 'm unconvinced by the idealists .meh .The church killed the church .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.53794"}

{"text": "I think the key here is that the title of the post includes the phrase \" what looks like racism \" .This , to me , means the commonplace ( and arguably incorrect ) definition of racism , which is \" talking shit about another race \" .( We can use the power+privilege definition if we want , but it does n't sound like that 's what Readers 1 and 2 are talking about . )So to me , the question is not whether PoC can be racist : this has been addressed many times in the literature , from many viewpoints .Beverly Tatum , for example , writes that using the power+privilege definition , in the U.S. , POC can not be racist , but notes that they can be bigoted and prejudiced ( as can anyone ) .So , if the question becomes \" Should WP call out what looks like bigotry and prejudice when non - white people do it ? \" , I think the answer is \" Yes , but \" .In particular , WP should consider whether it 's a good idea , what the WP will get out of the interaction , what the PoC will get out of the interaction , and what 's actually going on in the situation .It 'd be easy , I think , for many WP to mistake frustration , anger and outrage at WP as \" racism \" .And , I agree with M. Gibson , that WP have to \" clean up their house \" first .If , for example , Rush Limbaugh told off a Black person for making a \" ching chong \" joke , it would be meaningless , no matter how offensive the joke was .And the White person also needs to think about why they want to get involved .Like M. Gibson said , this can come very close to the Arab Trader argument .If the WP is looking to \" prove a point \" and show that \" Hey , look , Black people are racist too ! ! ! \" , then nothing good is going to come out of this , and the WP needs to stop and re - evaluate their thoughts .The one case where I definitely would n't get involved would be a PoC making derogatory and bigoted statements against their \" own \" ethnic or racial group .It 's such a complicated situation , particularly given internal conflicts the person may be feeling ; an outsider just woudn't have enough information to say anything constructive .But if a WP ( in the U.S. ) starts ranting about \" racism \" to a PoC , they need to know that there 's a good chance they 're going to look like a complete moron and forfeit any opportunity for a positive interaction .@Abrasink I would n't say that POC can not be racist .If you look at power sharing amid non - white people here in the States , Blacks have greater media representation and a greater share in the corporate world than say , American Indians .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.15425"}

{"text": "Nearly 90 % of respondents said no ( which is understandable -- after all , White men , who have traditionally benefited from preferential hiring , do not feel hampered by self - doubt or a loss in self - esteem ) .Indeed , in many cases affirmative action may actually raise the self - esteem of women and minorities by providing them with employment and opportunities for advancement .There is also evidence that affirmative action policies increase job satisfaction and organizational commitment among beneficiaries ( Graves & Powell , 1994 ) .There 's some interesting stuff about Texas which may be relevant here , if anyone else is still reading .Hopgood vs Texas in 1996 resulted in a ruling that race was not to be considered in consideration of applicants to university - that is , overturning the idea that there was a compelling interest in diversity that justified doing such .As we saw , Grutter vs Bollinger reasserted that the compelling state interest represented by the existence of diversity in student intakes justified consideration of race in examining applications , but for a period in Texas the consideration of race was made illegal in considering applications .This was an attempt to keep some diversity in applications , using Texas ' highly segregated school system as a lever .Interestingly , according to the most recent report , although the Top 10 % applicants had lower SAT scores than those accepted through the \" classic \" process , they consistently outperformed them through the freshman year , as they did the previous year .That is , the top 10 % entrants did not look as good as potential students , but turned out to be better students .Which brings us back to Allan Bakke - GPA is not the only criteri on for entry .As an example of a policy that does not ( ostensibly ) consider race but does , by attempting to remove perceived advantages both financial and cultural that are prejudicial to the chances of talented students in minority groups , this is quite interesting .It is also interesting that one of the arguments used by UMich in Grutter vs Bollinger was that students generally achieve better results in culturally and racially diverse environments - that is , that ensuring representation of diverse races and cultures also helps the majority members on campus .That presents an interesting and utilitarian case for the consideration of race as a factor in admissions policy .I remain undecided , although of course this is no longer a discussion about political correctness , a rhetorical and/or taxonomic concept , but affirmative action , a legal concept .I would probably cautiously incline towards the view of Supreme Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , that affirmative action in the Johnsonian sense remains a useful tool to compensate for ingrained privilege in certain circumstances but that its application should be with the ultimate aim of rendering itself obsolete .However , unless one is to adopt a crudely doctrinaire position in either direction - which is certainly a grunty grunty option - there are an awful lot of considerations to weigh up , and many different environments to consider .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.38827"}

{"text": "WILLIAM LAWRENCE , Dean and Professor of American Church History , Perkins School of Theology , Southern Methodist University For about three decades , there has been an enduring assumption that conservative churches are growing while liberal churches are declining .That period of time has overlapped with the rise of right - wing Christianity as a political force in American life .Together , the thesis about conservative church growth has been assumed to be accurate and the tactics of right - wing religiosity have been politically effective .Few journalists , sociologists , or religious researchers have ( until recently ) bothered to probe very deeply beneath the surface of these propositions .Yet some things are quite well known .The issues that matter to right - wing religious forces ( notably opposition to the practice of homosexuality and opposition to the freedom of choice with regard to terminating a pregnancy ) are not intensely hot - button issues for the millennial generation .To the extent that religious organizations have decided that they would tie their perspectives to a specific ideology on such moral questions , they have given millennials permission to disengage from religious organizations .Spirituality clearly matters to the younger generations .But ideological battles over issues that they do not consider spiritually decisive seem at best a waste of time .And at worst , such arguments are proof that younger persons will have to look elsewhere - not to established religious organizations - for meeting their spiritual needs .In the 1960s , many religious organizations lost touch with a younger generation who eagerly awaited a sign from the churches that civil rights and social justice mattered .Lacking such a clear sign , many of the young simply drifted away from church .It is now apparent that in more recent decades the zealous combination of right - wing politics and rigid religious moralism on a few topics has caused the newest generation of the young to become disenchanted and disengaged .Churches have to rediscover that at the core of their missionary responsibilities is reaching those who are not yet part of the religious organization .Until we do that , decline and disengagement will be the hallmarks of the way that younger generations view the church .LARRY BETHUNE , Senior Pastor , University Baptist Church , Austin I am neither a sociologist nor a statistician ; my observations are anecdotal , but they are from the \" front line .\" Fifteen years ago , the same Robert Putnam published \" Bowling Alone , \" an essay ( followed by a book ) about \" America 's declining social capital .\" Noting that the number of individuals bowling had increased while the number of league participants decreased , Putnam observed the general decline of participation in American social institutions .In my experience , this trend has continued in churches of all kinds , regardless of their political leanings .I suspect the involvement of some churches in extremist conservative politics does explain part of this decline .The polarizing , attacking rhetoric turning local houses of worship into partisan political caucuses is not only obviously damaging to the broader social fabric , but a betrayal of core Christian values regarding love , service , and concern for the poor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.09021"}

{"text": "As for tuition fees - on another factual tip , I believe all UK citizens doing full - time undergraduate courses had their tuition fees paid by the government before 1998 .You may be thinking of means - tested student grants , which meant that students were allocated living funds in inverse proportion to their parental income .More generally - I mentioned the \" top 10 % \" law in Texas above , and its equivalent in Florida .When affirmative action was outlawed in California , a similar programme was introduced .These were on one level avowedly race - neutral programmes but also used the segregation of public schools to ensure what the Supreme Court later reinshrined as a compelling state benefit - a culturally diverse student body .After all , if you are white and poor , since you have not faced any of the obstacles a member of an ethnic or cultural minority might have faced in accumulating wealth , you are clearly either incompetent or lazy .Why waste a university place when the applicant demonstrably lacks ambition or ability ?( That was a reductio ad absurdum , by the way , and does not reflect the views of the management ) .Joking aside , Biffa said above : . from a UK perspective , the nearest equivalent we probably have here is trying to take into account for university entry that applicants from more privileged backgrounds tend to get better results in their qualifications than applicants from less privileged backgrounds .In an uncorrected use of these results , then applicants from more privileged backgrounds will get into universities in larger proportions than the fraction of society which they ( numerically ) represent .There are a multiplicity of underlying social reasons why this is the case .Commenting on the Top 10 % law in Texas , I said : . for a period in Texas the consideration of race was made illegal in considering applications .This was an attempt to keep some diversity in applications , using Texas ' highly segregated school system as a lever .Interestingly , according to the most recent report , although the Top 10 % applicants had lower SAT scores than those accepted through the \" classic \" process , they consistently outperformed them through the freshman year , as they did the previous year .That is , the top 10 % entrants did not look as good as potential students , but turned out to be better students .Which brings us back to Allan Bakke - GPA is not the only criterion for entry .So , your argument that subsidised tuition fees may encourage applicants from lower income groups is a good one - although hardship grants that offset the cost of tuition fees for poor but able students might address this also .So , yes .I 'm all for increasing the opportunities for the economically disadvantaged , and also for the educationally disadvantaged .posted by tannhauser at 7:40 AM on March 18 , 2005 .This also upholds the trust between students and University - you get the grades - you get your place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.48413"}

{"text": "The conflation of the knapsack with the concept of privilege is one of CRT 's many fallacies .Well , I think systemic \" white privilege \" is a real thing .Relatively speaking , somebody who 's poor and white is going to have at least one less barrier against them than somebody who 's poor and black .I 'm not going to say this is necessarily true of poor whites today , but historically in the South , poor whites were used as the \" enforcer \" class against black people - essentially racial solidarity trumped class interest .This is not to say that the concept of \" white privilege \" is n't overplayed and that there are n't dynamics working in the other direction .The flipside of white privilege is that white people are not expected to be poor , and have a harder time getting help if they 're in a situation of endemic poverty .And in many cases , I think class disadvantage works far more against one that racial disadvantage .I think if you 're trying to get hired for a typical professional job , the stereotypical demeanor of either a \" ghetto \" person or of being \" white trash \" are going to very much work against you .You have proven that not all white people are equally powerful , and that people who are not white are sometimes powerful .Congratulations , that strawman is pretty dead .When sensible people talk about privilege one of the central features of the discourse is that the social systems that assign power ( and wealth and other things ) favor privileged groups ( such as white people or men ) over the non - privileged .That DOESN'T MEAN that the favoring is absolute .Imagine a game using a 6-sided die .If the die rolls a 6 Player A wins , if it rolls 1 - 5 Player B wins .This game very strongly favors Player B , but Player B wo n't win EVERY time .( This is not an argument for the specific degree of how unfair real world systems are ) .Instead imagine some teenagers , all from lower social classes in an urban environment .Turns out that the white teenagers are far less likely to attract police attention than the teens of color , and that when illegal behavior is detected the white teenagers are treated less harshly by the justice system .But it just gets better ( read as : worse ) !In my experience , it is also most often used by anonymous commenters who , ironically , turn out themselves to be privileged , mostly white and mostly male .They are , and act , just like born - again evangelists , far more zealous , dogmatic , unquestioning and aggressive in their newbie eagerness to prove their humility than those who have actually spent their lives in service of a cause . \"Privilege \" in a civil rights discussion is typically used as a means of cutting off activists ' nose to spite our faces , and then making sure we all bleed to death .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.21391"}

{"text": "RIC DEXTER , Men 's Division Chapter Leader , Nichiren Buddhist Soka Gakkai lay organization To understand what young Americans think , perhaps it is best to ask one .The response this week comes from Casey Bennett , SGI Central USA Student Division Leader : .Many youth I speak with feel they are estranged from their church groups because of the way that they live , whether it 's the clothes that they wear , the way they present themselves , the fact that they have tattoos , or even if they are homosexual .Many churches and synagogues do not engage the interest of the youth .I often hear said that the rules and customs of their religion can at best be considered dated , thus driving them away in droves .Exceptions to this rule are found in the realms of Islam , Buddhism or Baha'i .When speaking to my Muslim friends , it seems their community has done a better job of instilling a sense of a community that cherishes the youth .This trend is echoed in certain sects of Buddhism ( especially in the Soka Gakkai ) and the Baha'i faith .Many young converts to Buddhism and Baha'i embrace the fact that they are judged less on their lifestyle and choices in style , and more on the fact that it is one 's actions that truly make one great .This being said , when a person in these faiths is not acting in accord with the teachings they are encouraged to continue their journey of self - discovery and self - mastery rather than trying to fit into a mold cast thousands of years ago .This open , hands - off approach to faith seems to strike a chord with large numbers of youth wanting to continue expressing themselves as individuals , while being open to heart to heart guidance without constant judgment .After all , faith is , and should always be , a personal thing , one that each person must engage in and cultivate .My teacher , Dr. Ikeda explained , \" Each person has a precious and irreplaceable mission .As the Buddhist teaching of cherry , peach , plum , and damson blossom indicates , each person can be considered a special , distinct flower . \"\" Each individual is a capable person in his or her own way ; each person has a valuable purpose .That is why it is crucial for us to foster and support [ young people ] with all our hearts .\" ROBIN LOVIN , Cary Maguire University Professor of Ethics , Southern Methodist University My guess is that the \" millennial \" generation has detached themselves psychologically from all sorts of organizations , not just from organized religion .Of course , it 's easier to quit church than to quit the economy , though lots of millennials are having a hard time getting a serious career started .Some millennials have shown a passionate interest in politics , both of the Obama Nation and the Tea Party varieties , but that is a recent enthusiasm , and nobody knows how long it will last .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.42169"}

Lewis , a computer science professor and former dean of Harvard College , wrote in a blog post condemning the pledge .Some students signed because they felt they had to -- a completely predictable , yet somehow unforeseen , result that Tom Dingman , the dean of freshmen , says is \" against the spirit of the pledge .\" The signatures will no longer be posted .Yet what the Harvard Crimson dubs the \" freshman kindness pledge \" remains in place .The vast majority of freshmen , and the college itself , have formally declared that \" the exercise of kindness \" is \" on par with intellectual attainment .\" Both parts of that equation are odd , and they are odd in ways that suggest something has gone awry at Harvard .No Kindness Deficit .That problem is n't , as some might imagine , a kindness deficit .Do n't confuse the real - world Harvard with the one in the movies . \"As best I can tell , it 's a perfectly civil , polite , kind , cooperative student body , \" says Steven Pinker , the Harvard psychology professor and popular author .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.46837"}

{"text": "January 15 , 2016 9:03 pm .Reflecting on this essay , one can not deny the obvious conclusion that Millenials see things differently than do the previous generations .I notice it in my own ministry and in the ministries of my colleagues .My initial thought is that this generation is neither lost or enlightened , but rather shaped by a culture that has been created by the effects of being systemically , and systematically abandoned by the adults in their lives .Adults have touted the importance of ethical standards and behaviors ( \" true love waits , \" \" What Would Jesus Do ? \") , but often time failed to live up to the standards of holiness they preached .Rather than engage the culture that their kids lived in , adults sought to offer entertaining alternatives , which in a sense created a sub culture of sorts .Adults offered conflicting and contradictory messages without adequately explaining the reasoning behind why taking life in abortion is forbidden , but killing someone on the battlefield was acceptable and perhaps even encouraged .I know it is a generalization , but adults have not done an adequate job of being present to guide Millenials through these vital life questions .So what do we do now ?A few thoughts came my way while reading this essay today .In our ministries , I think it is vital to explore clear ethical boundaries in a way that encourages a discourse among the entire Church , but has as its foundation the love and grace of Christ .I believe the Church must engage culture ( rather than run from it or ignore it ) by erasing the sacred - secular boundary and bringing Christ into all parts of life .Finally , I think we need to call our congregations to a renewed vision of the value and sacredness of all life in Creation .Perhaps we can not undo the damage that has been done by previous abandonment , but maybe we can realistically engage those that fall into the Millenial generation .Robert Merrills .January 15 , 2016 10:39 pm .I do n't know that blog gives us enough information to lump a segment of society together and make a definitive claim either way .One thing Professor Oord post demonstrates is that thoughts about significant topics vary among the identified generations , which invites the question \" why do the generations you think that way they do ? \"As members of churches that may have pretty clear stances on same - sex marriage , abortion and war , it can be easily to hide behind doctrinal statements and substitute emotion with reason and bully our way through conversations that may sound pretty intolerant .At the same time the issues addressed in the blog are significant and still pose real challenges to and opportunities for the church to lead in love .One option is to develop the structure for having cross generational discussions on contemporary issues .This will better equip the church to understand what the issue , the foundation for generational opinions ( understanding generations do n't think exclusively one way ) and then to best articulate the churches beliefs while reinforcing the need to demonstrate Christ 's love through the process .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.64665"}

{"text": "However , an even better questions to ponder is , \" Have we as a society become desensitized to tragedy ?\" My answer to that question would be yes , we are well on our way to becoming desensitized to these horrendous events .We have become a society that has learned to repress these events to be able to move on with our day - to - day lives .The problem we now face is that we live in a nation where the economy has helped individuals foster a feeling of desperation which can lead to irrational thoughts .I mean lets face it , someone who shoots and kills other people for no apparent reason obviously is not rational or even sane for that matter .The question at the core of this topic is , \" How did we become this way ?\" I believe we got here by evolving into a self involved society , one without much kindness or respect for others .The other part of the puzzle missing is holding individuals accountable for their choices , which leaves them without taking responsibility for their behaviors .Unfortunately this has also become the norm .When we see tragic events taking place it is no longer an outrage , it is the norm .We have become desensitized to the point where it is no longer shocking to us and this is very sad .You as an individual can begin to play a positive role in our society by just being nice to others and yourself as you never know whose life you can have an impact on and maybe even be able to prevent the next horrible tragedy .We are currently allowing story comments via Facebook .This is a temporary measure .An all - new commenting system is planned for January .All comments must adhere to both our Terms of Service and the Facebook Terms of Service , including the use of real names .We require and expect that comments will be civil and free of personal attacks , inappropriate language and other abuses .Comments may be removed or deleted .If your value in society is defined by your ability to control your fears and the impact you make on those around you , then comes the next phase of growth , which focuses on your ability to change society for the better .There is something to be said about people who push the boundaries of the norm to create the change they wish to see and who take risks to create change .Back in 2010 , I discussed the importance of changing your perspective as it pertains to change and stop waiting for others to initiate something you can do today .So today , I pose the question : Are you a World Shifter ?A World Shifter is someone who impacts the course of someone else 's life as a result of going out of the norm through an act of kindness .For true change to occur in someone 's life , a certain event needs to occur that is powerful enough to create a change in their life 's direction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.14965"}

{"text": "Although the concept is gaining in popularity as many people born during the Jones timeframe feel it resonates with them , I wonder if the concept really has much value .The dates I mention on this blog for the timing of generations is drawn from the work of Neil Howe and William Strauss , who are well known for their work on generations .Their landmark book \" The Fourth Turning \" gives clear definitions of the cycle of generations and how they have evolved in the US over the last 500 years ( going back to England ) .The value of their research is partially in understanding our personal roots ( \" Oh , now I understand why my Boomer friend acts like that ... \" ) but more importantly in understanding the direction of our society overall .My question about Generation Jones ( and other divisions ) is whether it helps in that effort or just confuses .Here is a chart showing the roll of generations since 1900 ( click on it for a bigger version ) :According to Howe and Strauss , the marks between each generation are very clear and are based on their surveys of people born in these years .Each generation has a specific character , and these are shown on the chart by the various colors ( the \" archetype \" for each of these generations is shown in the legend on the right ) .The concept is that , for the most part , each generation is about 20 years ( give or take ) and they follow each other in a specific pattern ( Hero , Artist , Prophet , Nomad and so on ) .This pattern has ( mostly ) held true for the last 500 years of history , although some of the timeframes vary by a few years .If you accept this theory , at least in part , it allows you to extrapolate into the future based on the ages and attitudes of the generations that will be alive .I go into this concept further in my two presentations on turnings and generations ( Part 1 and Part 2 ) .But it does seem fairly unlikely that EVERYONE born in 1961 would have an \" X \" attitude when compared with EVERYONE born in 1960 , who would have a \" Boomer \" attitude .But I do n't think that is the point .Let 's look at an analogy .In 1984 Ronald Reagan won a landslide victory in the race for the Presidency against Walter Mondale .Mondale got only 13 Electoral votes vs. 525 for Reagan , in what , I believe was the most lopsided victory in US History .But what was the Popular vote ?The result was around 59 % to 41 % .Again a strong majority , but it does mean that over 37 Million people wanted Mondale to be president .Without going into how silly our electoral system is , I think there is a parallel to how we perceive the change in generations .Let 's look at that chart again , but this time with Generation Jones put on top to show the span of years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.67358"}

{"text": "TEXAS FAITH : Why are millennials dropping out ?In this piece for Politics Daily , the Dallas Morning News ' Jeff Weiss did some digging into a Pew Center report about the religious identity of \" millenials , \" which is the name for those Americans who are younger than 30 .Weiss picked up first on this part of the report : . \" Fewer young adults belong to any particular faith than older people do today .They also are less likely to be affiliated than their parents ' and grandparents ' generations were when they were young .Fully one - in - four members of the Millennial generation - so called because they were born after 1980 and began to come of age around the year 2000 - are unaffiliated with any particular faith .Indeed , Millennials are significantly more unaffiliated than Generation Xers were at a comparable point in their life cycle ( 20 percent in the late 1990s ) and twice as unaffiliated as Baby Boomers were as young adults ( 13 percent in the late 1970s ) .\"But then he noted this seemingly contradictory finding : . \"Young adults ' beliefs about life after death and the existence of heaven , hell and miracles closely resemble the beliefs of older people today .Though young adults pray less often than their elders do today , the number of young adults who say they pray every day rivals the portion of young people who said the same in prior decades .And though belief in God is lower among young adults than among older adults , Millennials say they believe in God with absolute certainty at rates similar to those seen among Gen Xers a decade ago .\" Weiss then reaches this conclusion : .Which says to me that young adults are not losing faith , just unplugging from religious institutions at a rate unprecedented in U.S. history .One theory that has been advanced is that the disengagement has to do with the entanglement of conservative politics with religion .Weiss , for example , cites the work of Harvard professor Robert Putnam and Notre Dame professor David Campbell .They claim in a study that : .In the 1990s many people who had weak attachments to religion and either moderate or liberal political views found themselves at odds with the conservative political agenda of the Christian Right and reacted by renouncing their weak attachment to organized religion . \"So , with that setup , here 's this week 's question : .That 's their take ?What is yours ?Assuming the Pew Center data is correct , why are young adults unplugging from religious institutions at such a high rate ?Read on for our panelists ' thoughts .Christianity has become a commodity in our society ; one product in a wide range of possibilities for consumers seeking fulfillment in life .This represents a significant shift from previous centuries .Worship styles serve as one great example of this consumer shift .Forty years ago the vast majority of Christians worshipped in a service conducted predominantly in Latin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.032616"}
