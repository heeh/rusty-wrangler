'Fully automatic ' means when the trigger is held down , multiple bullets are fired . 'Semi - automatic ' means that each trigger pull fires a single bullet , but no cocking or other motions are required for subsequent shots ( ie , you can fire as quickly as your fingers will pull ) .Period .Any semi - auto weapon ( IMHO ) is ultimately on pretty equal footing with standard hunting weapons .So , since there is no technical definition ( thus , your blog which would not be necessary otherwise ) , this is my offering .I 'll go with Bill on that .If you ask the state of California , it 's any semi auto rifle with a \" pistol \" type grip , capable of accepting high capacity clips .By their definition several competition .22 rifles and sporting shotguns , would have fallen into the \" assault \" rifle catagory .Somebody came to , and re worded that definition .Otherwise their olympic shooting team was going to have to practice in Nevada . \" A military rifle , capable of controlled , fully - automatic fire from the shoulder , with an effective range of at least 300 meters \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.49805"}
