{"text": "Speaking at a university graduation ceremony in Jericho , Abbas stated that the borders of the Palestinian state would stretch from the Dead Sea in the south and through the Jordan Valley all the way up to the town of Bet She'an in the north .This is a Palestinian - Jordanian border and that is how it will remain , \" Abbas said .\" The responsibility for security along the border will be in the hands of the Palestinians .Abbas 's remarks came in wake of leaks by Palestinian officials to the effect that at the current US - sponsored secret peace negotiations , Israel is demanding full control over the border with Jordan in any peace settlement with the Palestinians .Israel , of course , has its own reasons for refusing to cede control over the strategic Jordan Valley .Israel 's main concern is that the border with Jordan will be used by Palestinian terror groups and Islamist fundamentalist organizations to smuggle weapons and terrorists into the West Bank and Israel .However , there 's another reason why Israel remains strongly opposed to surrendering control over its border with Jordan to the Palestinian Authority or a third party .It is no secret that the Jordanians have long been worried about the repercussions of the presence of Palestinians on their border .In a recent closed briefing with a high - ranking Jordanian security official , he was asked about the kingdom 's position regarding the possibility that Palestinians might one day replace Israel along the border with Jordan .May God forbid ! \" the official retorted .\" We have repeatedly made it clear to the Israeli side that we will not agree to the presence of a third party at our border .The official explained that Jordan 's stance was not new .\" This has been our position since 1967 , \" he said .\"The late King Hussein made this clear to all Israeli governments and now His majesty , King Abdullah , remains committed to this position .Jordan 's opposition to placing the border crossings with the West Bank under Palestinian control is not only based on security concerns .Of course , Jordan 's security concerns are not unjustified , especially in light of what has been happening over the past few years along the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt .The Egyptians are now paying a heavy price for neglecting their shared border with the Gaza Strip over the past few decades .This lapse has seen Sinai emerge as a hotbed for Al - Qaeda - linked terror groups that are now posing a serious threat to Egypt 's national security .Besides the security concerns , the Jordanians are also worried about the demographic implications of Palestinian security and civilian presence over the border .Their worst nightmare , as a veteran Jordanian diplomat once told Israeli colleagues during a private encounter , is that once the Palestinians are given control over the border , thousands of them from the future Palestinian state would pour into Jordan .The Jordanians already have a \" problem \" with the fact that their kingdom 's population consists of a Palestinian majority , which some say has reached over 80 % .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "31.190052"}

{"text": "Connected to these declarations , the Arab states have persistently denounced the unilateral diversion of the Jordan River as completely illegal .The Israeli response has been that the surrounding Arabs nations were never willing to let Israel exist in peace .These historical disagreements intertwine with the dispute between Israel and Jordan in which the Jordan River plays a main role .In order to understand the core of the conflict between Israel and Jordan around the Jordan River , it is important to note the different perceptions of water between the two countries .Jordan , as part of the Arab world , percieved the water problem as part of the Arab - Israeli conflict .Therefore , for Jordanian , water was always a matter of an Arab national pride ( Copaken , p.84 ) .For Israel , as a young country , water seemed to be an integral part of territory and a necessary resource for development ( Copaken , p.56 ) .As the population of Israel grew , the reliance on the Jordan River grew to over 50 percent of their water wage .In the early 50 's Israel created a National Water Carrier to transpot water from the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee to the Negev desert .These new waterways permitted cultivation of additional desert land .However , in the eyes of Arab nations in the 1950 's , the National Water Carrier became a symbol of Israel 's aggressive expansionism .In reaction , in 1955 Syrian artillery units opened fire on the Israeli construction team .In an attempt to settle the water dispute , American President Eisenhower appointed Eric Johnston as mediator ( Cooley , p.9 ) .Negotiations between Arab states and Israel on regional water - sharing agreements continued for more than two years with no actual success beyond a cease fire .Following more than 10 years of silent tensions , the conflict flared again .The Syrian government , inside its borders , attempted to divert the Banyas River which is one of the Jordan River 's tributaries .This was followed by three Israeli army and air - force attacks on the site of the diversion .These incidents regarding water issues led up to the outbreak of the Six - Day War in June 1967 between Israel against Syria , Jordan , and Egypt .During that war , Israel captured the Golan Heights and the site of the Banyas headwaters , which enabled Israel to prevent the diversion of the Banyas by the Syrians .Israel also gained control of the West - Bank , the Jordan River as well as the northern bank of the Yarmouk ( Cooley , p.16 ) .In the year following the Six - Day War , Israel increased its water use from the Jordan River by 33 percent ( Glace , p.85 ) .Jordan , on the other hand , lost to significent access water from the Jordan River .The Jordanian 's plans to expand usage of the river and its cannel system had to be terminated by the outcome of the war .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.382015"}
{"text": "Such sizeable spikes in population have , of course , necessitated significant increases in food production .About 65 percent of the water Jordan takes from the river goes toward agriculture .And with UN agencies spending four million dollars a month providing food for Za'atari alone - three million of which goes to the local economy - it 's becoming ever more profitable to cultivate previously unused patches of land .Israel allots an even greater share of its river water to agriculture .Israel 's national water system diverts water from the Jordan 's flow as it passes through the Sea of Galilee in the north of Israel , and redistributes it to the country 's densely populated core and arid , largely previously uninhabitable south .Historically it 's drawn heavily on groundwater , but seven years of drought have drastically lowered the lake 's level and forced the country to reduce its consumption of the Jordan River 's water .From a high of 400 million cubic meters ( mcm ) eight years ago , FOEME estimates that Israel withdrew around 160 mcm from the Sea of Galilee last year .Jordan , by comparison , pumps an average of 300 mcm a year from the Yarmouk River , the Jordan River 's largest tributary .Israel recently announced plans to release 30 mcm back into the Jordan , which is seen as a positive first step , but not enough to aid the river 's rehabilitation .\" It 's a miniscule amount that will do nothing for the river , \" according to the Arava Institute 's Lipchin .This does , however , mark a potential upturn in the Jordan 's fortunes .The rapid development of high - tech desalinization plants along Israel 's Mediterranean coast has greatly diminished the country 's dependence on freshwater sources .Half of Israel 's drinking water is now desalinated , a figure the government hopes to increase to around 70 percent , or 700 mcm , by 2020 .Water from the Sea of Galilee is still about a third of the cost of desalinized water , which requires a lot of electricity to produce and so is prohibitively expensive in the north of Israel far from the plants .But even there , treated wastewater has largely replaced freshwater for crop irrigation . \"Israel 's water economy is very healthy , \" said FOEME 's Mehyar in Amman , noting that Israel recycles 87 percent of its water , with Spain the next best in the world at 21 percent , and Jordan coming in at under 10 percent .( Learn how to reduce your own water footprint . )Environmental concerns are certainly responsible in part for Israel 's swift advances in desalinization , but it has long coveted an independent water supply shielded from regional upheaval .Tensions with Syria and Jordan over their plan to divert water away from Israel contributed in part to the 1967 war , which Israel won and thereafter annexed the Golan Heights , which abut the Sea of Galilee , and began its occupation of the West Bank .Of course , Syria also should be involved in any effort to rehabilitate the Jordan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.80976"}

{"text": "40 Headed by the Islamic Action Front ( IAF ) , the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan , the Islamists base their opposition on religious ideology , claiming that Palestine and Jerusalem are Islamic lands and must be liberated through jihad .41 The leftists base their arguments on economic and territorial exploitation by Israel .However , the Islamists have adopted a less religious tone , often using leftist arguments .The goal of the anti - normalization movement is to use civic organizations and professional associations to reduce the practical significance of the peace treaty .The main office of Jordan 's professional associations houses an anti - normalization committee as well as the associations of 14 professions , including doctors , lawyers and engineers .Each has its own council , and any Jordanian who wishes to practice in one of these professions must register with the respective association .Professional associations are seen as the one true democratic outlet in Jordanian life since most Jordanians do not have faith in the parliamentary electoral system .The example most frequently cited by the opposition is the 1993 election , when the regime changed the election rules to ensure its allies would win and ratify the treaty with Israel .In previous elections , the law designated a specific number of parliamentary seats for each electoral district and allowed voters to vote for the number of seats designated for their district .For example , a voter in Amman 's second district , which had three designated seats , would cast three ballots for candidates of his or her choice .This system enabled coalition building and allowed parties such as the IAF to increase their representation .This was extremely beneficial to tribal leaders loyal to the regime ; the IAF lost almost half of its seats .The treaty was overwhelmingly ratified by parliament , but the opposition believes that the change in the election laws diminished the will of the people .In the associations , members choose their leaders democratically .Each has its own internal governance , and if someone practices a profession without registering with the association , the company that hires that individual can be penalized .The professional associations also take measures against members who cooperate , or \" normalize , \" with Israel .This has been interpreted to include attending an international conference with Israeli participants or even visiting Israel for personal reasons .Such individuals must appear before an internal - governance panel comprising three individuals with the power to expel offenders .This is an economic threat to those who cooperate with Israelis , as Jordanian law requires professionals to be members of their associations .Expulsions can be overridden by the government 's Higher Court of Justice because of the Jordanian - Israeli peace treaty , but according to the leadership of the associations , the reputation of the individual would be ruined and they would find it difficult to find work .This is probably an exaggeration ; there are companies and individuals who work with Israelis , and there are jobs outside the network of the associations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.135277"}

{"text": "According to the peace treaty , each country receives most of its water through its respective river .Jordan 's is mostly allocated through the Yarmouk and Israel 's through the Jordan .The treaty also allocates water from the other river to each country .Israel receives 25 million cubic meters ( mcm ) from the Yarmouk , and Jordan receives 30 mcm from the Jordan .Israel is also permitted to pump an additional 20 mcm of water during winter from the Yarmouk into the Sea of Galilee .This amount is redirected to Jordan during the summer months .This is a significant reduction from the amount of water it was using from the Yarmouk prior to the peace agreement .However , Israel is permitted to maintain its usage of the previous levels of water from the Yarmouk until Jordan builds a dam on the river .Jordan 's share of water from the Jordan River is a significant improvement compared to its situation before the peace agreement , when it did not receive any .Out of its 30 mcm allocation , 20 mcm comes from the river itself , while the rest comes from the Sea of Galilee until it can be provided by a desalination plant that processes groundwater sources .The treaty also states that Israel and Jordan will work together to provide Jordan with an additional 50 mcm of fresh water in the future , but it does not specify how the costs for this would be distributed .Some argue that the water regime under the peace treaty favors Israel , as Jordan receives less under the treaty than it would have under previous proposals before peace .But there is no question that Jordan benefitted from the treaty with respect to its water supply ; previous plans allocated water to Jordan based on its control of the East and West Banks .In fact , Jordan 's water gain is one of the major selling points used by supporters of the treaty to convince the Jordanian public .The question is exactly how much the treaty will increase Jordan 's water supply in the future , since financial considerations will have an impact on the development of dams and desalination plants .The treaty does not specify the quality of water Jordan is to receive from Israel .Thus , at times Jordan has received polluted floodwater , and this has led to tensions .As recently as early 2009 , the Jordanian Ministry of Water and Irrigation detected polluted water contaminating the Yarmouk , which provides Amman with almost one - third of its water .However , once the polluted water was detected , the water tunnel was closed down , the water was discarded , and Israel compensated Jordan by replacing the polluted water .A similar incident occurred in 1998 .When such incidents occur , the two sides work together to find solutions .Some Jordanians believe that , when it comes to water , Israel is far more accommodating than Syria , which takes more than its share of the Yarmouk River , despite Jordan 's protests .One Jordanian expert on water issues cited two occasions in the past 10 years when Syria declined Jordanian requests to release more water because of shortages in Jordan ; in contrast , Israel released additional water and took a share back later .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.02528"}

'Zahran makes the following claim : .Nonetheless , the Hashemites have not honored their part of the deal , which is : recognizing the Jewish right to the land .This pact declaring the King to be \" The Custodian of the Al - Aqsa Mosque \" is reminiscent of an old Hashemite title , \" The Custodians of the Two Shrines .\" This new title evokes memories of the Monarchy 's rule over the Islamic holy sites of Medina and Mecca before the King of Saudi Arabia claimed the title after expelling the Hashemites to TransJordan ... and it connects King Abdullah to the prestigious Al - Aqsa Mosque .As for Abbas , he has no authority to make such a bequest .If you keep in mind the 1994 treaty , President Abbas who is well - past his legal stay in office , does n't have the rights to Jerusalem 's holy sites be able to turn power over to Jordan .Zahran believes : .\" It 's obvious that the desire to hold on to power and all that comes with it has motivated this Abbas - Abdullah alliance with hopes it will fool enough people into believing their version of Middle East history on the eve of new talks .The decades of failed Israeli - Palestinian peace negotiations are n't due merely to the conflicts over borders , blockades , settlements , outposts , land resources or the construction in East Jerusalem .The failure can only be attributed to three widely - ignored \" elephants in the room \" that have prevented the Palestinian and Israeli leadership from signing any final peace treaty .With this in mind , President Obama 's recent trip to Jerusalem , Ramallah and Amman may be viewed as an effort to bring King Abdullah II into future negotiations with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas .Therefore , an agreement that was signed by Abbas and Abdullah shortly after Obama 's visit may well be a symbol of a tacit alliance by which each boasts the other 's status before going into any future peace talks .It 's also important to note that both these leaders have lost considerable political power with their respective peoples and the void is being filled by clan leadership .Their agreement , signed on March 31 , affirms King Abdullah II as the \" Custodian of the holy sites in Jerusalem \" and that \" he has the right to exert all legal efforts to preserve them , especially Al - Aqsa Mosque .\" It is obvious that this alliance coordinates their efforts to defend Jerusalem against the Judaization of the city .Looking back in history , this agreement can be seen as the conclusion of a verbal agreement made in 1924 that had given the Hashemite Monarchy custodianship over Jerusalem 's holy sites , but the signing was timed as a symbol right after President Obama 's trip .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.06358"}

{"text": "The source of the problem is the fact that most of the citizens of the Hashemite Jordanian monarchy define themselves as \" Palestinians \" , but their state is \" Jordanian \" .So how should they relate to it - as their country or as a foreign country ?The core of the problem hinges on the fact that the Kingdom of Jordan is not an entity with historic roots , but rather a modern creation of British colonialism that succeeded the Ottoman Empire at the conclusion of the First World War .Back then its name was \" The Transjordan Emirates \" because the British did not have a better , more unique name for it .Jordan is part of the \" Sham \" , the area that today includes Jordan , Israel , Syria and Lebanon .Until the era of the British Mandate , Jordan was never a state or a distinct country , like - for example - Egypt , and did not have its own local leadership .This fact is the reason that the regime in Jordan is seen as an illegitimate regime by many in Jordan even today .Jordan is culturally divided into two parts : Bedouin on one hand , and farmers and city folk on the other .In the days of the British Mandate , before the establishment of the Emirates , everyone was \" Palestinian \" because everyone was a resident of the British Mandate for Palestine - the Land of Israel .Some of them had family connections with the residents West of the Jordan , and therefore it was easier for them to adopt the Palestinian self - definition , which they preferred over that of \" Jordanian \" .In the 1948 war , a few hundred thousand Arabs fled from Israel to Jordan , most being housed in refugee camps .During the years after that , mainly as a result of the Six Day War in 1967 , a few more hundred thousand moved to Jordan .All of these are \" Palestinians \" of another sort : those who in the past lived in \" Western Palestine \" , and then crossed over the Jordan .All together , the Palestinians form an absolute majority of the residents of Jordan , estimated at 70 percent .The Jordanians - by the way - claim that the Palestinians are no more than 30 percent .The main task of the monarchy since then has always been to unite the two main components of the population : the Bedouins and the Palestinians .In recent years this task has been given the name \" Jordan First \" , which is to say that all of the residents of Jordan should adopt the common Jordanian national identity , and rise above their traditional cultural differences .Just how effective this campaign has been is subject to disagreement .The king and his supporters speak of \" holy unity \" , while the Palestinians speak about a feeling of being pushed to the sidelines .This feeling of theirs stems from the fact that government positions are usually given to Bedouins , while the Palestinians are prevented from taking any significant part in governing , and therefore they mainly employed within the private economic sector .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.34837"}

Lowdermilk , conducted research on a canal stretching from the Mediterranean , across the Negev Desert , to the Dead Sea .He calculated that the 400-meter drop would generate 100 megawatts of electric power .Scientists have revisited the idea of a hydroelectric scheme that would produce water without flooding tourist and industrial sites along the shores .In 1977 , an Israeli planning group considered four possible routes for a canal : one from the Gulf of Aqaba in the south and three from the Mediterranean ( the northernmost being the one envisioned by Lowdermilk ) .The group favored the southern - most Mediterranean route , which would avoid the country 's major aquifers and could promote development in the northern Negev .The project would refill the lake to the level of the 1930s over a period of 10 to 20 years .After 20 years , when the Dead Sea reached its historic levels and the inflow matched the evaporation rate , the flow of the canal would be reduced .In addition to restoring the level of the lake , the canal would generate electricity .The group determined that an inflow of 1.6 cubic kilometers of water per year would generate up to 800 million kilowatt - hours of electricity per year .Storage reservoirs would be built so that the generation of electricity could be regulated to meet demand .The Jordanians proposed a similar canal , with the source of water originating from the Red Sea instead of the Mediterranean .According to the plan , water would be pumped from the Red Sea at Jordan 's southernmost town of Aqaba to an elevation of 220 meters .From there , it would flow via tunnel through the Jordan Rift Valley mountains for 200 kilometers before dropping into the Dead Sea .The Israeli- and Jordanian - proposed Dead Sea hydro projects focused on power generation rather than water generation .A new study -- started in the early 1980s and completed in September 1996 by Harza Engineering of Chicago -- suggested that a Red - Dead Canal could generate fresh water that could be used to supplement scarce water resources in the region .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.38808"}

{"text": "Two very interesting patterns emerge here .The first is that the Arab Riots of 1936 - 1939 began a continuing pattern wherein Western powers have rewarded Arabs for their violent behavior by caving in to their needs .Indeed , it was the British appeasement policy that emboldened al - Husseini and other leaders to continue their violence , knowing that it was the best way to extract concessions from the British .Since then , Arab nationalists in the Middle East have discovered that rioting , war and terrorism are the most effective way to get concessions from European powers , especially when couching such acts in the guise of anti - colonialism .The best contemporary example is , of course , the Arab desire to return to the 1947 Partition Plan .The Arabs unanimously rejected Partition in 1947 , launching a campaign to destroy Israel and liquidate the Jews .They missed their chance for an Arab Palestinian state , and continued to wage a 60 year campaign of violence .Those 60 years of violence toward Israel have actually improved the Arabs ' negotiating position , now many states support their desire for a state and argue that Israel must remove Jews from Arab lands as a precondition to peace .Israel has been pressured to give away land to the Arabs despite the fact that the Palestinians refuse to even acknowledge the Jewish right to self determination .The second interesting feature is that we assume that the Jewish state was ripped from an Arab state or Arab homeland .As previously noted , there was no Arab sovereignty over Palestine for 400 years .To the extent that there was an Arab majority in British Mandatory Palestine , 70 % of the Mandate was used to create a state that ended up having 100 % Arabs and 0 % Jews : Transjordan .The idea of creating a second state for the Arabs of the British Mandate arose primarily because the Arab leaders in Jerusalem were not willing to submit to the Hashemite leaders in Transjordan ( who were foreigners from Hejaz ) .In many ways , Jewish nationalism and Arab nationalism in that part of the world came about at largely similar times .At the time of the first Zionist Congress , only Saudi Arabia had truly made major strides toward becoming independent of the Turks .This is a lot of history ... but why is it important ?We are bombarded with imagery about the conflict and with discourse that frames Jews as foreign invaders stealing land from a place that would otherwise have been a proud and flourishing Arab state .Indeed , we are taught to believe that but for Zionism , Palestine would have existed as a state .And indeed , that might have been so .But the simpler fact is that the Arab leader from Palestine did nothing to endear themselves to either the British or the Ottomans , while the strategically thinking Hashemites from Hejaz catapulted themselves into power in Jordan and ( until the Ba'ath Revolution ) Iraq .It 's much easier to blame the Jews than look into the past and understand their own flawed path , but unless we are willing to examine how we got to where we are today , we will have no idea how to move forward .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.90872"}

E. Lawrence 's classic accounts , greatly exaggerates not only its spontaneity , size and scope but also its military value .The first phase was confined to the Hijaz , where Mecca , Taif and Jedda fell in rapid succession to the rebel forces consisting of Hijazi Bedouins commanded by the sharif 's four sons , Ali , Abdullah , Faisal and Zaid .Three of these groups laid siege to Medina and were tied down there until the end of the war , contributing to the war effort largely by sabotaging the Hijaz Railway , the main Turkish supply route to Medina .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.58975"}

Lawrence ( \" Lawrence of Arabia \" ) and a few other visionaries who thought that both Arab nationalism and Zionism could co - exist under British sponsorship .That concept did n't last very long and had no policy influence beyond the early 1920s at most .Before and During World War Two .Realizing that it needed Arab support to fight in the coming war , the British followed an appeasement policy that was quite willing to sacrifice the Jews for Arab help - or at least non - interference - in the battle .If the Arab side had cooperated with these pre - war plans , Arab Palestine might have emerged in 1948 , with the Jews driven out or massacred shortly after .Instead , the radical Arabs - both nationalists and Islamists - made a deal with the Axis .Germany and Italy supported these forces in order to destroy the British and French position in the region , just as the Germans had done in World War One .While the British worked with the Zionists during the war on common endeavors , there was never any notion that a Jewish state would aid British interests in the region .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.38455"}

{"text": "One of the weapons in the arsenal used by those committed to the delegitimization of the Jewish state , and the denial of Israel 's right to self - defense , is \" lawfare , \" a term coined by US Attorney Major Michael Newton .Lawfare is commonly defined as a strategy of using or misusing law as a substitute for traditional military means to achieve military objectives .The term can be used to define the new strategy that has been adopted in the political war against Israel .The strategy to delegitimize Israel using legal frameworks , and exploiting both international and national legal forums , was adopted following numerous failed military attempts to destroy the Jewish state .Lawfare involves two key components , both of which are employed against the state of Israel .The first is the flagrant abuse of the laws of armed conflict as a means of goading military forces into apparent violations of the law and using these alleged violations as propaganda against those forces .For example , terrorists will attack Israeli forces while hiding behind their own civilians and then blame the consequent loss of civilian life on aggressive or disproportionate IDF action .The second component of lawfare is no less damaging than the first .As part of this prong of attack , individuals and groups are encouraged to file criminal and civil law suits in national and international legal forums against prominent military and government figures for alleged violations of international law .The number of law suits that have been filed against Israeli officials has grown exponentially in recent years .These suits have been filed against government officials and political representatives from across the political spectrum , indicating a blanket condemnation of all Israeli actions and initiatives .Targeting Israeli officials attracts significant media interest and coverage , and therefore , even though most cases are dismissed in the preliminary stages , all constitute a public affairs coup for the plaintiffs .This form of lawfare does not simply impede Israeli travel plans .It is intended to intimidate officials from acting out of fear of prosecution , and in fact impacts foreign relations , strains international ties , and serves to delegitimize the Jewish state .As a result of these consequences , several countries have amended their laws , so as to restrict the ability of private groups to initiate these lawsuits and abuse the national legal system .While a step in the right direction , lawfare continues unabated .It must be recognized that just as German military theorist Carl von Clausewitz states that \" war is ... a continuation of political activity by other means , \" so too , lawfare is a continuation of terrorist activity by other means .And just as terrorist activity should be rejected by every person of conscience , so too , lawfare must be abandoned .Is Israel treated fairly in the United Nations ?The State of Israel is an active member of the family of nations and a dynamic participant in international organizations .Israel is one of the few states established under the aegis of the United Nations , joining that international institution as its 59th member on 11 May 1949 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.91435"}
