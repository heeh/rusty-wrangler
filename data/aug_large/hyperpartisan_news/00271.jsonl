{"text": "What many refer to as al Qaeda 's formal \" affiliates \" are really branches of al Qaeda that have been assigned to fight in these regions .The formal branches of al Qaeda , each designated its own region , are : al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) , AQAP , the Al Nusrah Front in Syria , and Al Shabaab .All of them have sworn loyalty to Ayman al Zawahiri .In addition to these regions , al Qaeda also maintains facilitation networks in countries such as Iran .Thus , the brief sketch of al Qaeda I have drawn here is one of a much more cohesive international organization than is often assumed .Like all other human organizations , however , al Qaeda has faced obstacles in trying to hold this network together .For instance , the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham ( ISIS ) was al Qaeda 's branch inside Iraq , but the group 's emir had repeatedly disobeyed orders from the \" general command .\" This led to ISIS being disowned by the group .ISIS is currently fighting the Al Nusrah Front and its allies in Syria .In addition to the formal branches of al Qaeda , there are other organizations that are part of al Qaeda 's international network even though they have not publicly sworn bayat to the leadership .Indeed , al Qaeda has often hidden its precise organizational relationship with groups that are being groomed for an alliance .Both the Al Nusrah Front and Al Shabaab , now formal branches of al Qaeda , did not make their operational connections to al Qaeda 's senior leadership known at first .Al Qaeda also employs multiple brands so as to obfuscate the extent of its influence .In Yemen , for instance , AQAP adopted the name \" Ansar al Sharia .\" This brand name was intended to convey the idea that the group is the true protector and enforcer of sharia law .Other groups calling themselves Ansar al Sharia have been established in Egypt , Libya and Tunisia .There are still other groups that have adopted al Qaeda 's ideology , but are probably not operationally connected to the \" general command \" or al Qaeda 's branches .I begin with this overview because the enduring threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan extends far outside of the region .Al Qaeda is , at its heart , a clandestine organization , but careful analysis reveals that it has a deep bench of talent from which it draws .Since its founding in 1988 , the organization has attempted to conceal its operations .This has made it difficult to assess some very basic aspects of al Qaeda .The group does not , for instance , publish an organizational chart or make its total roster known .If you watch al Qaeda carefully enough , however , you can see that the group has consistently replaced top leaders lost in the 9/11 wars .In some cases these replacements are not as competent , while in other cases they may even surpass their fallen comrades .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.152813"}
