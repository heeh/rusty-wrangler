{"text": "It 's the kind of meeting educators hate : a hundred angry parents packed into a stuffy school auditorium and squeezed into seats built for third - graders .This is Park Slope , Brooklyn , an enclave of urban , liberal - leaning professionals who push their babies around in $ 800 strollers while pondering whether or not the new artificial grass in the park will give their kids cancer .These parents obsess over every detail of their children 's lives - especially their education .Polakow - Suransky is leading the drive to develop a better way to judge a school 's success .Shael Polakow - Suransky ' 94 , the chief academic officer and senior deputy chancellor of New York City 's school system , stands before them , ready to receive their ire .He has taken off the jacket of his pin - striped suit and rolled up the sleeves of his well - pressed white shirt .With his balding head , modish eyeglasses , and thoughtful and sympathetic air , he looks exactly like the school principal he used to be .Although chairs and a table have been placed on the stage for his use , he has chosen to stand on the auditorium floor , placing him at the same level as the assembled parents .\" How can you use a tool to evaluate my child that has no validity ? \" one of them asks .She is referring to the annual standardized tests the city uses to assess student performance , tests that are dreaded and loathed in Brooklyn at least as much as they are in the rest of the country .Parents everywhere complain they are a one - size - fits - all assessment that measures a student 's ability by how well he or she answers multiple - choice questions . \" As a taxpayer , \" one mother says at the meeting , \" they make me want to get violent .\" Through it all , Polakow - Suransky remains calm and collected .The exams are by no means perfect , he says , but at the moment they are the best way the city has of ensuring that its schools offer a fundamentally sound education .Whereas schools were once evaluated solely on whether or not they taught the curriculum , they are now judged on how well they teach it .\" We do n't yet really have a strong , robust evaluation system , \" he concedes .But \" at this moment in time they are the only tests available . \"Shael Polakow - Suransky wants to change that .Long a champion of progressive education , he 's an outsider turned insider , a revolutionary become reformer .In the schools where he 's worked - the Crossroads Middle School and Bread and Roses Integrated Arts High School in upper Manhattan and the Bronx International High School - students called their teachers by their first names and received lengthy written evaluations instead of graded report cards .Yet here he is , the second - in - command of a school system that measures the success of its students with a standardized multiple - choice exam .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.20183"}
{"text": "The coded language , Polakow - Suransky writes , was a clear reference to nuclear warheads .Some critics have questioned this certainty .Peres denies Israel made the offer .And Polakow - Suransky himself said , \" The deal never came to fruition .\" But more important , he added , \" There are a lot of others that did . \"Supported by documents in his book , he said , \" These guys were building missiles together and testing them off the coast of South Africa throughout the 1980s .The transfer that did n't happen in 1975 turned into a joint research and development project in South Africa for 15 years .\" Polakow - Suransky 's book also reveals that for many years South Africa supplied uranium to fuel Israel 's Dimona nuclear reactor .For many , this was the unsentimental relationship of two states that turned to each other as each grappled with their pariah status in other parts of the world .But Polakow - Suransky says their relationship went beyond realpolitik .For at least some on the Israeli side , he said , it became a bond of two allies who understood and sympathized with each other 's existential struggles .He sees similarities between Afrikanner nationalism and the revisionist Zionism of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and his ideological heirs .Polakow - Suranksy singles out comments made by right - wing Israeli figures such as Ariel Sharon , Gen. Rafael Eitan and Revisionist leader Eliahu Lenkin that crossed a line into what he calls \" ideological affinity . \"In December 1987 , for example , Eitan , by then a national political leader , told an audience at Tel Aviv University that South African blacks \" want to gain control over the white minority , just like the Arabs here want to gain conrol over us .And we , too , like the white minority in South Africa , must act to prevent them from taking over . \"\" There is a difference between saying we understand where these people are coming from and why they have to do what they do and actually saying that black people do n't deserve the vote , that Afrikaners deserve to have power , \" Polakow - Suransky said .\" At some point it went beyond just understanding and it became an actual expression of support for certain people . \"Gideon Shimoni , a professor emeritus at Hebrew University who has written a seminal text on South African Jewry , met Polakow - Suransky early on in his research .They both say that Shimoni advised him to drop the subject because he would never gain access to the needed documents to make his case .Now that he has read the book , Shimoni is impressed with Polakow - Suransky 's achievement .But he thinks Polakow - Suransky failed to maintain his objectivity in alleging ideological similarities . \"He allowed himself to be too judgmental , \" said Shimoni .He cited specifically the book 's depiction of Peres .Even Polakow - Suransky acknowledged that Peres became his big villain , a hypocrite who spoke out against apartheid in public but fostered the relationship in secret .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.406265"}

{"text": "-- Speaking of which : The latest gadgetry , \" NBC Olympics Mobile , \" will offer \" comprehensive coverage of the U.S. Olympic Trials for users on the go , \" the network says in a release .Offered will be \" news , schedules , and slideshow galleries from the trials , \" as well as \" highlights and exclusive feature videos on - demand to mobile video users . \"And there you have it : If you do get anything live from NBC from Eugene or Omaha in the next week , it will come to you in full , living , 1.5-inch ( measured diagonally ) stunning cell - phone color .As we mentioned , the grids for the network 's Beijing coverage itself are still in the works .But West Coasties should be prepared for more of the same -- the vast majority of Olympic events delayed by 12 - 15 hours , for prime - time packaging .No question the time difference in play here -- Beijing is 12 hours ahead of New York , 15 hours ahead of Seattle -- makes live coverage challenging .Games organizers have , in fact , shifted some schedules around to help : Swimming finals , for example , will take place in the mornings in Beijing , giving NBC the chance to show them live in prime time in New York .Some gymnastics and beach volleyball likewise will be live - coverage candidates .But even that coverage likely will be delayed three hours to Seattle , if the network insists on its usual prime - time packaging approach .It 's the usual East Coast - centric mindset : Viewers in New York and Philadelphia and MIami deserve to see it live .L.A. , Seattle , Portland ?Let them wait .One small glimmer of hope for people with fast broadband connections : The network is promising \" live streaming Olympic broadband coverage , 2,200 hours in all , \" from Beijing .No details yet .And no promises of any live Beijing coverage on the new all - Olympic - sport TV network NBC is supposed to be building to supplement the Universal Sports online streams .All told , the network is promising some 3,600 hours of Beijing TV coverage -- which it claims is more than the combined total coverage hours of all previous Summer Olympics broadcast in the U.S. .But our point remains the same : Pre - packaged , time - delayed schlock spread across multiple platforms is still pre - packaged , time - delayed schlock .We do n't care if it arrives via satellite , cell phone , broadband or pony express : By the time we get it , it 'll still be yesterday 's news .( And believe me , we hear in the newspaper business know something about yesterday 's news . )Being around around the Olympics for the past decade , we have heard one message loud and clear from the Games - viewing public : People want it live .They care not whether it interrupts the nightly blonde hairflip intro to the Dopper weather map on the 5 p.m. local news , soap operas , or even Oprah .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "122.22373"}
