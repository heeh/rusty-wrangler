Bush captured 40 + percent of the Hispanic vote .In 2012 Romney got only 25 percent .That difference in the makeup of the electorate helps explain Obama 's second term .At the same time , it would be a mistake to automatically assume that any Democrat in the future will always gain that level of the vote by a specific demographic group .Every election is different .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.774403"}

John McCain 's pollster in the last presidential election and works nationally for major clients like AT&T , the National Football League and GE .He lives in Boise . )In a previous post , I noted the wide demographic splits that characterize attitudes about the economy in Idaho .In a nutshell , many older , less well - off , and less educated Idahoans are pretty content with the Idaho they have long known , including an economy dominated by agriculture and the state 's natural resources .A younger , better educated group thinks about the future economy quite differently .They believe innovation , education and technology hold the keys to the future .Idahoans in our survey were almost equally split : 24.5 % said the Luna efforts would make students better prepared , 27.3 % said less prepared , 28 % said the reforms would have no difference .The rest did n't know or declined to answer .Looking more deeply into the internal numbers reveals that the level of division about the effectiveness of the reforms in terms of student preparedness cuts across virtually every demographic and ideological boundary .Even the most conservative folks we surveyed are split on whether the reforms will better prepare kids for more school and future work .In fact in no demographic group - males , females , very conservative people , younger folks or older , etc . - does the reform package command a 50 % majority who are convinced it will make students better prepared .Perhaps this has something to do with the tone of the legislative debate around school reform .As the debate unfolded from January to April it was , by and large , a back - and - forth about teachers and money .That debate continues on an almost daily basis with Luna recently warning educators to be careful about mixing politics and school business and teachers accusing the superintendent of violating ethics rules .And there is more : Idahoans who say they prefer a future economy focused on exporting goods and services , encourging innovation and fostering an entreperneurial culture are the most skeptical of Superintendent Luna 's reform package .This group thinks , by a 2 to 1 margin , that the reforms will result in students less well prepared for further education and future work .We also asked our survey group to identify the initiatives \" most important to helping Idaho 's economy grow and create new jobs ? \"Providing better K-12 education and increasing the number of students that pursue higher education was the top choice of 43 % of respondents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.72162"}

{"text": "After Democratic candidate Chad Taylor dropped out , Orman led in the polls but the anti - Roberts vote was split when Taylor was listed .In order to improve Roberts ' chances , Kansas Secretary of State Chris Korbach ( who is also a member of Roberts ' honorary campaign committee ) played politics and refused to take Taylor 's name off the ballot .The Kansas Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that Taylor 's name should be removed from the ballot now that he has dropped out .Kansas election law does provide for the ability of the Democratic Party to name a replacement after Taylor dropped out , but obviously they have no intention of doing so .Korbach is claming that the Democrats are required to name a replacement , but it is rather absurd that a party must run a candidate if they do not desire to do so .Rick Hasen , an election law expert from the University of California , Irvine , said that it was unlikely that Kobach would be able to force the Democrats to name a replacement for Taylor .\" If Democrats refuse to name or no candidate agrees to serve , then what ?It seems like it would be a tough First Amendment claim to FORCE a party to name a replacement , \" Hasen wrote in an analysis .\" Perhaps if Democrats do nothing Kobach will realize there 's not much he can do and drop the issue . \"Despite his current lead , it is still possible that the Republicans can hold onto the seat .The national party is taking over management of Roberts ' campaign , and has called in Bob Dole to help secure the seat .Even if Orman maintains his current lead in the polls and wins , there is no guaranteed that he will caucus with the Democrats .With the battle for control of the Senate so close , it is certainly possible that he could wind up casting the deciding vote .In late August I wrote about the Senate race in Kansas , where there was felt to be a real chance of defeating Republican Pat Roberts if the Democratic candidate , Chad Taylor were to drop out .In that situation , polls show that independent Greg Orman has a real chance to beat Roberts .Orman has run as a Democrat in the past , and Democrats hope that he will caucus with them if he wins .Taylor did drop out of the race on Wednesday , increasing the chances that the Democrats can retain control of the Senate .While there has been speculation that the Democrats might be able to beat the incumbent Republican in Georgia or Kentucky , this probably does make Roberts the most vulnerable Republican .One reason that Orman out polls Roberts in a two - way race is that Roberts has run a poor campaign .In response , the national Republican Party now seeks to take control of the Roberts campaign .This further shows that they do feel that Roberts is now vulnerable .Different pundits differ on how much of a difference this will make .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.952194"}

{"text": "Ashok Rao has a new post laying out a proposal for an immigration permit auction , as suggested by prominent immigration economist Geovanni Peri .This is a great idea , and it would definitely be a major improvement for public policy , especially if the number of visas auctioned was substantially higher than current immigration levels .That said , it is n't the only way you could do market - based immigration policy .One alternative would be to have an immigration tariff , as advocated by Gary Becker .Instead of auctioning a fixed number of permits , the government would sell as many permits as demanded at a fixed price .The benefits of this kind of system are broadly the same as the benefits of an auction Ashok describes in his post .However , there are a few subtle differences that for me suggest a tariff might be a better way to go .The first reason to prefer a tariff is that it means the market is more responsive to shifts in supply and demand .In a boom , more people want to come to the country and the economy ' wants ' more immigrants .In a recession , the opposite is true .Using the auction system , the same number of people come - all that changes is the price .Under a tariff regime , on the other hand , the number of migrants is free to fluctuate according to the needs of the economy .This is true on a micro as well as a macro level .If a new computing technology creates a sudden need for hordes of Indian programmers , or demand for immigrant builders goes up following a huge natural disaster , then the policy responds by allowing more immigrants .Yes , the government could adjust the number of auctioned permits according to economic circumstances , but it is better that changes in the number of migrants be market - driven , rather than decided by bureaucratic assessments of ' need . 'Having a fixed tariff price , or at least a planned price schedule , also gives a level of certainty to the market .If I live in Mexico and my family is saving up to buy my way into the USA , I want to know how much I 'm going to need to squirrel away .With an auction , the price will vary from year to year , perhaps dramatically , and there will be no guarantee that my savings will prove sufficient to get me a permit this year , or even next year .Tariffs solve this problem .A criticism of immigration tariffs are that it is difficult to know how many people will come .If permits are auctioned , then the government knows what the level of immigration will be .There will be no concerns about a ' flood ' of immigrants driving up house prices , overwhelming public services and so forth .Under a tariff system , things are much murkier - immigration is very difficult to forecast , as the UK government found to its embarrassment in the mid - noughties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.17491"}

Birney of the anti - slavery Liberty party got 62,103 votes or 2.3 % of the popular vote , enough to have made a difference in some Northern states .In the Electoral College , Polk got 170 electoral votes , winning states both in the North and South .Manifest Destiny proved to be a popular platform .Clay won 105 Electoral Votes , winning his home state , Kentucky , Tennessee , Ohio , and a few Eastern states , including New Jersey , North Carolina and Massachusetts .The United States formally annexed Texas in March 1845 , just before Polk took office .As expected , The Mexican War broke out the following year .As for Polk , he served one term , during which he worked very hard , to the point of exhaustion .He declined to run for a second term and died within three months of the end of his administration . \"Mr. Carson clearly does not understand or care about the Constitution , which states that ' no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office , ' \" said CAIR national executive director Nihad Awad .\" We call on our nation 's political leaders - across the political spectrum - to repudiate these unconstitutional and un - American statements and for Mr. Carson to withdraw from the presidential race .\" I can understand if Nihad Awad is more familiar with the details of Sharia law than the US constitution , but the provision barring any religious test does not apply to the voters .They can vote for , or against , a candidate for any office for any reason at all , including not liking the candidate 's religious beliefs .The constitution forbids the federal or state governments from imposing a religious test or qualification to bar candidates from running .For example , in the presidential elections of 1928 and 1960 the Catholics Al Smith and John F.

'By the end of his life , Hitler had a pronounced tremor in his hands , particularly his left hand , which has caused a number of scientists to question whether he had the disease .Parkinson 's can also cause a slow gait , bent posture and a dull stare , along with cognitive disorders such as a lack of imagination and a general apathy .The researchers suggest that Hitler 's condition may have led him to attack Russia prematurely in 1941 , according to a report in Discover .A previous study claimed that Hitler 's decision to invade Russia , before defeating Britain on the western front , was a direct result of his failing health .The study points to other bad decisions of Hitler 's such the failure to defend Normandy in 1944 , alongside keeping his forces in Stalingrad in 1942 .They say this was the result of the dictator 's ' volatile temperament ' which may have been aggravated by his Parkinson 's .The study also goes on to suggest that Hitler 's lack of remorse and sympathy can be associated with his Parkinson 's .Assuming that Hitler did indeed suffer from Parkinson 's disease , how did it affect his judgement and the outcome of the war ?Hitler always was something of a gambler and a risk taker , preferring to improvise rather than making elaborate plans .This willingness to risk everything on a single throw of the dice , as it were , helped Hitler immeasurably during his rise to power in Germany and in the early years of his rule , especially since he could also be patient when it was necessary .Up until around 1937 Hitler was largely successful in obtaining his goals both inside Germany and in Germany 's relations with its neighbors .Germany seemed to have largely recovered from the Great Depression and regained its place as one of the leading nations of Germany .Had Hitler stopped then , he would possibly be regarded as a great statesman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.41348"}
{"text": "The Roman Empire had been first divided into Western and Eastern halves by the Emperor Diocletian about a century earlier .After ending the period of incessant civil wars and foreign invasions that had nearly destroyed the Empire , Diocletian realized that one man was unable to meet the challenges of ruling the entire empire and so had divided it .The last emperor to rule over the whole Roman Empire was Honorius 's father Theodosius the Great .After his death in 395 , the empire was divided for the last time between his two sons Arcadius and Honorius .Arcadius was the elder brother and so inherited the more desirable Eastern Empire where he ruled from Constantinople , while Honorius became the Western Emperor .Both emperors were minors when they acceded to their thrones and neither ever really showed much talent for ruling but the wealthier and more urbanized Eastern Empire proved to be better able to weather Arcadius 's inept rule .The West was not so fortunate and Honorius 's reign was a disaster from beginning to end with continuing invasions by the barbarian Germans and continual civil war by usurpers .At the beginning of Honorius 's reign the true ruler of the West was his guardian , Stilicho a Roman general of mixed Roman and German descent who had been related by marriage to Theodosius .Stilicho was perhaps the last Roman ruler who could have saved the Western Empire from destruction .He had some success in holding the Empire together but proved unable to prevent the invasion of Gaul by the Germans in 406 and the subsequent abandonment of Britannia .This proved to be not a very good idea , since by then , the Roman army was largely made up of Germans , large numbers of Honorius 's soldiers simply deserted leaving Italy defenseless against the invading Visigoths under their king Alaric .The Visigoths did not intend to capture Rome or conquer the Roman Empire .Indeed , they did not believe such a thing was possible .They , along with their kinsmen the Ostrogoths had fled into Roman territory to escape the Huns .Alaric wanted to negotiate with the Roman government for a homeland to establish an independent Visigothic kingdom allied to Rome .Alaric decided to threaten the city of Rome to compel the Roman government to negotiate in good faith .Honorius and his court were not greatly concerned however because it had been a long time since Rome was actually the capital of any part of the Roman Empire .He was safe in the city of Ravenna with its impregnable defenses and kept putting Alaric off until he was exasperated enough to sack Rome on August 24 , 410 .Sack was perhaps too strong a word for the actions of the Visigoths .They did systematically take anything of value they could carry away , but there was no destruction of buildings or slaughter of the population .The Visigoths could not believe they had actually captured Rome and they acted more like awestruck tourist than barbarian plunderers .Meanwhile Honorius was distraught upon learning that Rome had been taken , until the messenger clarified that he meant the city and not Honorius 's pet chicken Roma .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.35934"}
