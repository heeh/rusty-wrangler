{"text": "Let 's look at what happened .The results .So far , my appeal to help the Amachi charity resulted in 92 individual donations totaling $ 4,352 ( excluding the PayPal fees ) .I consider this an extraordinary result since this total is not inflated by \" friends and family \" donations .The total I am reporting represents the new value I created for Amachi by establishing an effective social media presence and creating new connections that did not exist prior to the time I started blogging in 2009 .But we need to take a much closer look at the results to really discover the true nature of social influence .Here 's an indicator of what we 're up against .My blog post was tweeted 446 times but only 92 people actually made a donation .So the reality is , 354 people encouraged others to donate without donating anything themselves .Here is the breakdown of strong connection versus weak connection donors : .I am pleasantly surprised that as many as 30 people could have come across the blog via Twitter and donated to the cause .I think the number is actually much lower because I 'm sure some of the donors in this category are actual readers of the blog who I do n't recognize .But nevertheless , about one - third of the donors were people who do not have a personal relationship with me , which is pretty cool .Here 's a second indicator of how the weak connections represented by social media \" friends and followers \" is not a very actionable group of people .A couple social media heavyweights with more than 100,000 followers ( and even more than 500,000 followers ! ) heavily tweeted my post to try to help .I estimated they generated more than 3 million Twitter impressions .Here is how many donors this activity generated : ONE .So the \" celebrity influencer \" conversion rate on Twitter was 1 out of 3 million possible impressions .Sad , but not surprising .Digging even deeper , we see that the strong relational connections from the blog community had a powerful impact on both the number of donations and the average amount of the donation : .One premise behind Return On Influence is that the ability to create content that moves through the Internet is a legitimate source of power .In fact , this is the ONLY source of influence I have over most of you .It 's probable that you only know me through my content that is shared over social media platforms and , through time , you have come to trust and like me enough to act on a personal request .Think of the incredible potential we all have here .From a standing start in 2009 , I have been able to create a global community that responded to an appeal in one blog post and contributed $ 4,352 in 48 hours .It took hard work to get to that point , but you have that opportunity - that power - too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.264854"}

{"text": "Now , it bears pointing out as well that there is a huge misconception between the true definition of skepticism , and its common interpretation .Most people think being a skeptic means to not believe in something , or to be an active proponent of disbelief in a given phenomenon , hypothesis , story , etc .That is n't true .Being a skeptic simply means not accepting something as factual without proof , including the assertion that something is n't true .In other words , a skeptic can not honesty or with integrity tell you , \" Everything you have said is wrong and you are a fool to believe it \" as a statement of fact unless they have proof of that fact .All they can say is , \" In the absence of conclusive proof , you could be wrong , or you could be right .\" They might also , based on evidence they 've seen or not seen , say , \" I have seen no evidence that anything you 're saying is true or accurate .\" That is n't a personal attack .It 's just a statement of fact consistent with skepticism .You have to be prepared to accept those kinds of statements if you 're at all serious about your intended message being taken seriously .You must also understand that many members here have been through this same scenario many , many times in the past here on ATS .With particular reference to disclosure , there have been countless threads claiming that official disclosure will occur on a specific date or within a certain time frame .Every one of these thus far , with the exception of course of those rare few with dates still set in the distant future , have been false .With reference to other predictions pertaining to tumultuous and world changing events ( with very , very rare exceptions , ) there have been threads beyond reckoning that have all also turned out to be false .So you must be tolerant and understanding of long term members here being extremely reluctant to place any faith in your claim without irrefutable proof .That does n't mean they 're \" one of those damn skeptics who refuse to believe in anything , \" because as explained above , that is n't what being a skeptic really even means .It just means that they are being a good skeptic .Skepticism is n't a negative or blinding stance , nor does it mean one has been blinded by lies or misinformation , because a true skeptic does not accept anything as fact ( official or otherwise ) without proof .It can be healthy and stimulating to engage in skepticism even with regard to deeply held beliefs .For example , with regard to anything you believe - whether it 's the topics discussed in this thread or not - ask yourself : where does your information come from ?Do you have proof that those sources are absolutely , irrefutably accurate and reliable ?Have you seen that proof yourself ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.23506"}
