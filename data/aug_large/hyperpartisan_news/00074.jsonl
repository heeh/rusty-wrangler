{"text": "As a rough estimate , data reported by The Chronicle of Higher Education ( 1998 ) showed that blacks represented 9.5 % of all students enrolled in colleges and 7.2 % of those in graduate programs .When these figures are used to assess employment patterns in professional and college sports organizations the demographics do not appear to be disproportionately biased in any systematic fashion .In the final analysis , as in other endeavors , the route towards increased representation in professional occupations , among which the many non - playing sport positions should be included , comes with educational attainment .This represents a broader issue in society , but one that is magnified by the strange disproportionality of players to administrators and coaches in our major professional and collegiate athletic programs .Stacking .Stacking relates to the phenomenon of finding a non - random distribution of whites and blacks in certain playing positions .For example , in baseball , pitchers and catchers have tended to be disproportionately white , while outfielders have tended to be black ( Rosenblatt , 1967 ) .In football quarterback is typically a position held by whites , while wide - receiver and running back are ones held by blacks ( Jones , Leonard II , Schmitt , Randall , & Tolone , 1987 ) .Historically , in basketball , the positions of center and guard were disproportionately held by whites , while forward was identified as a black position ( these patterns have been eliminated as participation rates by blacks have increased ; Berghorn , Yetman , & Hanna , 1988 ) .A number of explanations have been advanced to account for this phenomenon .Their analyses of baseball ( in which catcher , pitcher , shortstop , second base and third base were identified as central ) , and football ( in which quarterback , center , offensive guard , and linebacker were identified as central ) were consistent with their contention .Edwards ( 1973 ) , however , argued that the centrality theme was less about simple spatial location than it was about the degree of control and leadership associated with a position .Consequently , pitchers and catchers or quarterbacks and centers are not only in the center of coordinating game activities , but they exert greater control over what happens in terms of action and outcome .Interestingly , such beliefs about racial differences transcend our borders and are found as well in England ( Lashley , 1989 ) .Hoberman ( 1997 ) makes the case that the creation and maintenance of such a belief structure was important to colonial psychology because it provided a justification for white male authority .Today , it is used to provide a basis for separation between playing , administrative , ownership positions in sports .Such ideas would suggest that white and black players are , in some fashion , channeled into positions which match stereotypes by persons in authority ( i. e. , coaches , owners ) .To support such a contention , data would be required which demonstrated that at earlier stages of participation blacks and whites are proportionately distributed across playing positions , and as they move up the athletic pyramid , they tend to be distributed disproportionately into certain playing positions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.607895"}
{"text": "The same argument is equally compelling for intellectual capacity .If race as a biological concept is invalid , then too are claims that people with lighter skins are intellectually superior to those with darker skins .The point is that striving to become a professional athlete is a risky proposition for any person since it often requires many years of total dedication that often is associated with a failure to develop knowledge and skill in other areas .The vast majority of aspirants never see a professional pay day , and are ill equipped to do other things .But for a variety of reasons , blacks have become more vulnerable to the carrot that is held out , and the great success of black athletes is accompanied by too many forgotten youth who not only have no contract , but no direction .The question of why blacks seem so directed to pursuing an athletic career is of considerable interest to students of sport .Edwards ( 1973 ) has argued that the major reason for this is a lack of perceived opportunities in other areas .Undoubtedly , overt and covert discrimination has historically played a part in relegating them to support positions , rather than to those of authority and control across a large spectrum of educational and occupational endeavors .Seemingly , black youth who are in search of role models observe blacks as successful athletes and entertainers , but do not see or have contact with the disproportionally few who have succeeded in the professions or in the corporate world .Consequently , these youth commit considerable intellectual and physical energy to becoming professional athletes rather than to a variety of other occupations with which they have difficulty identifying .A recent Sports Illustrated poll showed that 55 % of black middle school and high school youth believed that they might be good enough to play in the NBA one day , while only 20 % of white youth believed this to be so ( Price , 1997a ) .As well , 49 % of the black youth polled thought that they could play in the NFL some time in the future , while 27 % of whites believed that they would be able to play in the pros .The fact that black youth have somewhat of an unrealistic belief in their athletic prospects may seem irrational to the casual observer , but such beliefs are not simply the creation of a group of immature children and adolescents who are living in a fantasy world .The mechanism driving this demographic shift is a system of beliefs , embraced by both groups , that is based on the unfounded biological assertion that blacks are genetically stronger , faster , quicker , and born with optimal instincts for sports requiring speed and power .Interestingly , this is a reversal of thinking held during the colonial era when physical vibrancy was characteristic of white males and associated with the dominance exhibited by European nations over lands inhabited by dark skinned peoples .This is precisely the point raised by Edwards ( 1972 ) a quarter of a century ago when he observed that whites lose little in reinforcing the belief in black physical superiority in that in the modern world physical superiority really counts for very little outside of sports .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.31459"}

{"text": "Whether such a phenomenon is a result of actively channeling players of different races into certain roles , or whether players opt for these roles as they ascend the athletic pyramid was not ascertained by this study .Perhaps , both mechanisms are responsible .Olsen ( 1968 ) , for example , conveys the anecdote of Gene Washington , a black who played quarterback at Stanford during his first two years , and then switched to flanker in his junior year .He , not his coaches , requested the change reasoning that a black had little chance to make it in the NFL as a quarterback unless he was outstanding .So he opted for the more peripheral role in which he thought he had a chance to play professionally .An alternative to the channeling hypothesis was proposed by McPherson ( 1975 ) .He argued that instead of black youth being channeled into certain positions by coaches , they merely modeled their athletic heroes , and consequently played similar positions in their own athletic careers .Because the first positions played by blacks in baseball were in the outfield , and in football they were in the offensive and defensive backfield , as well as on the defensive line , subsequent black players followed in their model 's footsteps , perpetuating the cycle .Inferred is the idea that channeling may have once been an explanation for disproportionality in playing roles , but now disproportionality can be better explained by modeling .Some evidence supports this interpretation .For example , Brower ( cited in Eitzen and Sage , 1986 , p. 276 ) asked a sample of 23 white and 20 black high school football players which athletes they most admired , and which positions they preferred to play if they were able .Seventy percent of the blacks choose only black role models while whites chose role models irrespective of race .As well , black athletes also preferred to play at the non - central positions which were at the time typically black positions .More recently , Price ( 1997a ) reported that black and white kids were asked to identify their athletic role models .Interestingly , 7 out of 10 athletes named were black , and he inferred that black and white kids were color - blind in selecting names .While the question was not asked regarding which playing positions kids wished to play , the article infers from various anecdotes that black kids wished to follow in the footsteps of black stars .Today , many have the impression that stacking is no longer an issue since blacks have become such a dominant force in our three major professional sport .Yet , the 1997 Racial Report Card ( Lapchick and Mathews , 1999 ) tells a different story .Table 6 clearly shows that in the NFL , although 65 % of the players are black , they are still disproportionately found on offense at the running back and wide receiver positions and on defense as cornerbacks and as safeties .Table 7 also indicates that in baseball stacking still seems to be a factor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.240326"}

{"text": "Critics contend that this approach is racist , since it perpetuates the idea that blacks are different , and often inferior .Edwards ( 1972 ) asserts that a typical theme resulting from such analyses is that blacks are physically superior , but intellectually inferior , to whites .Hoberman ( 1997 ) has further made the case that physical prowess , especially in such sports as basketball , has become a defining characteristic of the African - American community , and that beliefs about physical superiority are closely yoked to an anti - intellectualism that permeates black male culture .If interpreted on face value without critical analysis , it is easy to jump to the conclusion that such differences are innate and racially determined .As Edwards ( 1972 ) points out , this might lead some to conclude that blacks evolved differently than whites and remain at a more primitive evolutionary level because they are more closely associated with lower animals who are also known to possess greater speed and strength .On the other hand , it is only a short leap to believing that whites evolved to a higher intellectual level than blacks because they dominate virtually all other areas .Consequently , an explanation of black dominance in major sports which focuses predominately on physical differences between blacks and whites often results in reinforcing stereotypical ideas about black physical prowess rather than exploring the significance of motivation , intellect , discipline and hard work in accounting for athletic success .Campanis was invited to appear on ABC 's Nightline hosted by Ted Koppel .During the interview , Campanis was asked why he thought so few blacks were in management positions in baseball .Campanis replied : \" I truly believe they may not have some of the necessities to be a field manager or perhaps a general manager \" ( Wilhelm , 1987 , p. 46 ) .He also stated that blacks were not adapted to be swimmers because of a lack of buoyancy .Although Campanis was fired within 48 hours for his comments , it is interesting to note that he was considered to be one of baseballs more notable equal - opportunity employers ( Neff , 1987 ) , and had a reputation for fairness ( Callahan , 1987 ) .There 's a belief that they 're fine when it comes to the physical part of the game , but if it involves brains they just ca n't handle it \" ( Wilhelm , 1987 , p. 46 ) .Ideas about race related physical differences have also been prevalent , and most certainly were responsible for the comments of former CBS sportscaster Jimmy \" the Greek \" Snyder .In January of 1988 , he asserted that blacks were not only better athletes than whites , but heredity was primarily the reason .He stated that blacks were bred to be better athletes than whites because slave owners during the civil war bred \" ... his big black to his big woman so that he could have a big black kid . \"He went on to say that such breeding resulted in blacks having bigger thighs than whites which gave them an advantage in athletics ( Ballad , 1988 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.61433"}

{"text": "Rebounding is also essential to staying on the court .Furthermore , during half court games , defensive players typically can rebound and score without first taking the ball behind the foul line , making rebounding critical to success .Ultimately , these conditions produce the best players , since such individuals get the most playing time to develop their skills , game savvy , and confidence .As well , the demands of such competitive play over a long period of time , would lead to physical adaptations described by Ericsson and Charness ( 1994 ) and typically attributed to unique racial inheritance .In contrast , the suburban player typically learns the game on underutilized facilities .This means that often the individual practices alone , and develops skills outside of a game context .Consequently , shooting skills may be sharply honed , but be difficult to execute in the presence of defensive players .As well , unlike in the inner city where courts are crowded , in suburbia players need to be rounded - up just to have a game .This often entails players coercing individuals to play who are normally less skillful , and less interested in participating .Carlston suggests that to keep such individuals happy , more skillful players must get less skilled players involved , which often means sacrificing opportunities that better players may have to dominate play and enhance their own skills .As well , physical contact must be kept to a minimum to appease recruits .Such a dynamic tends to promote mediocre play in which the intent is to keep players happy and involved rather than to advance excellence or promote the development of dramatic \" moves \" .As suggested , these differences may actually be cultural rather than racial .In a subsequent interview , he mentioned that although he grew - up in an upper - middle class neighborhood , he took week - end trips to inner - city Oakland in order to find a game ( Price , 1997a ) .He said that if he went to his high school to play on weekends it would be locked up , but he knew that if he went downtown garbage cans would be prying the doors of the gymnasium open and games would be ongoing .Presumably , this is where he developed the skills and style which ultimately resulted in winning a contest heretofore reserved for inner city black players .More recently , Wideman ( 2001 ) , writing about how closely playground basketball was intertwined with cultural expression in the inner city neighborhood of his youth states : .Playground hoop is partially a response to the mainstream 's long , determined habit of stipulating blackness as inferiority , as a category for discarding people , letting people crash and burn , keeping them outsiders .And if that 's what race means out there in the mainstream , and it surely does appear to mean all that from the point of view of an insider , here within the cage where playground ball is contested , then fuck it .Forget it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.56867"}

J. Benton is a part owner of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays .In the NFL William Simms is a partner with the Carolina Panthers , and Deron Cherry with the Jacksonville Jaguars .Considering the large percentage of black players in these leagues it does seem rather strange that so few blacks hold ownership shares in franchises , and that no blacks serve in the roll of chief executive officer .In a sense , though , this parallels the situation in corporate America in which none of the one hundred largest corporations in America has a black chief executive officer ( Chenault , 1997 ) .Traditionally , teams were owned by wealthy whites who made their money in other endeavors , and ultimately passed them down to their progeny , who sold them to other wealthy individuals , or to corporations .That virtually all of the individuals engaged in these transactions over the years just happened to be white is magnified somewhat because of the visibility of sports , and to the dominance of the black athlete today .But , one also must realize that black ownership is not just a matter of distributing franchises in proportion to national demographics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.89833"}

{"text": "In theory , for individuals to be members of the same race they should possess relatively homogenous genetic material , and be heterogeneous with respect to other homogenous groups .In his presidential address to the American Anthropological Society Washburn ( 1963 ) strongly argued against the existence of such entities , especially when limited to what we commonly know as Caucasoid , Negroid , and Mongoloid classification .As an example he asks whether it makes any sense to place the relatively isolated Australian Aborigine into the same group as the inhabitants of Africa just because of skin color ?Further , he points out that even within groups within Africa such as the Pygmies , there are at least three different origins for people so classified .Data from the Human Genome Diversity Project confirms these assertions by showing that inter - individual genetic variation between people in the same sociological racial grouping is much greater than between the averages contrasted across different classifications ( Begley , 1995 ) .The concept that race as a biological entity is meaningless does not connote that we are all the same .Surely , human variation which provides advantages and disadvantages to people participating in different activities is a very real phenomenon .Indeed , it is clearly shown in Table 2 that certain somatotypes and physiological capabilities are associated with certain types of athletic events ( Carter , 1970 ) .As shown in bold , one observes that swimmers tend to be much lower on the endomorphic component than football players , basketball players tend to be higher on the ectomorphic component than other athletic groups , and weight lifters tend to be highest on the mesomorphic component .While variability exists across activities , it is evident and logical that at high levels of performance task demands require athletes to possess an appropriate body type .The point , however , is that systematic variation in body configuration does not co - vary with any meaningful designation of biological race .Table 1 .The Case of the Kenyan Runner .This would give them an advantage in activities that require speed and power .This could , in theory , account for why only blacks were finalists in the 1968 Olympic 100 meter dash .But it also creates a problem in accounting for why blacks from Kenya , beginning with Kip Keino , have dominated longer distance events .Conceivably , a higher percentage of slow twitch fibers would be advantageous here since endurance , rather than power , is essential .In an attempt to explain why Kenyan runners have become the dominant force in distance running , Moore ( 1990 ) examined Kenyan culture and its physical environment .The result of such a profile suggests that , over time , Kenyans may have developed biological traits that would give them an advantage in the longer distances where they have been so successful .But the vigorous culture in which they live also is probably responsible for their attitude about running , and their striving to achieve success on the world stage .Such a profile gives Kenyans what appears to be a high resistance to fatigue when compared to other groups of people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.63002"}

{"text": "Furthermore , in the United States , where black athletes have excelled on both the national and international level , the assumption of intra - group homogeneity is problematic since migratory patterns and intermarriage among peoples from different groupings have created a genetic admixture which is too complex to meaningfully disentangle .Price ( 1997b ) points out that although most black Americans are descendants of slaves who emanated from western Africa , 90 % have some white blood in their ancestry .An interesting example of this point is illustrated when one attempts to categorize Tiger Woods .He has been hailed by some as the first black golfer to win the Masters .But Tiger contends that he does not consider himself black , but \" cablinasian , \" which more accurately portrays his Caucasian , Black , American Indian and Asian heritage ( El Nasser , 1997 ) .Again , from a sociological viewpoint what constitutes a black in the United States relates to whether or not an individual has any black ancestry , rather than whether his or her underlying genetics is representative of a group of people a common gene pool .Consequently , even if we were to subscribe to the variability hypothesis conveyed by Burfoot ( 1992 ) and Gladwell ( 1997 ) , we would still have the problem of identifying individuals who were members of the group to which the idea applied .Simply categorizing individuals as black or white would not be enough .Linking Genetic Attributes to Specific Athletic Abilities .Another issue that deserves further scrutiny is what to make of studies which over the years have found anthropometric and physiological differences between white and black samples ?Is it reasonable to conclude that such differences , if they really exist , would give blacks an advantage in speed and power events ?Indeed , is there any scientific evidence which definitively shows that such differences are the basis for observed differences in athletic performance .Price ( 1997b ) makes the point that although such morphologic differences are interesting and suggestive , it is premature to assume that they can account for the performance differences found between the individual who breaks the world record and the individual who finishes 10th .He goes on to point out that Carl Lewis fits the perfect profile of a sprinter who is tall , long - legged , and possessing narrow hips .But during his prime he was beaten four times by Ron Brown who was shorter and stockier .Malina ( 1986 ) also makes the important point that despite many studies which show differences in motor performance among groups classified according to racial labels , the relationship between performance differences and genetic factors have not been examined .Consequently , any differences found in performance can not be causally linked to genetic factors .Thus , uncertainty remains whether differences in performance , or for that matter differences in physical and physiological attributes , are primarily a function of genetics , environment or a combination of the two .It is also interesting to note that Saltin ( Burfoot , 1992 ) compared Kenyan and Swedish runners and found a number of small but important physiological differences which could give Kenyans an advantage in endurance events .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.71102"}

Clarke ( who later became an Admiral ) would call de Weldon to his office to look them over .When he saw the picture of the Flag Raising on Iwo Jima he immediately recognized that it would catch the imagination of the American people .It was wonderfully composed .It showed the forward drive , the unity of action , the will to sacrifice , the holding up of our Flag , the symbol of our liberty .Many years later de Weldon would say , \u00d2I had been an artist all my life .When I first saw it I recognized the power of this photograph .I could not take my eyes from it .I looked at the photograph for some hours and then began working .\u00d3 .De Weldon asked Commander Clarke if he could discontinue , for the time being , the painting of the Battle of the Coral Sea and make a model of the Flag Raising .Although Clarke said go right ahead , the difficulty was that at the Naval Air Station they did n't have any sculpture material .However , de Weldon knew that they had a lot of floor wax and a lot of ceiling wax .The floor wax was too soft and the ceiling wax was too hard but if he mixed the two in a hot kettle they could be mixed to just the right consistency to model .So he borrowed from the mess hall a large pot and put both waxes in and heated it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.46072"}

Schrier , assembled at the base of Mount Suribachi .The platoon 's mission was to take the crater at Suribachi 's peak and raise the U.S. flag .The platoon slowly climbed the steep trails to the summit , but encountered no enemy fire .As they reached the top , the patrol members took positions around the crater watching for pockets of enemy resistance as other members of the patrol looked for something on which to raise the flag .At 10:20 a.m. , the flag was hoisted on a steel pipe above the island .This symbol of victory sent a wave of strength to the battle - weary fighting men below , and struck a further mental blow against the island 's defenders .Marine Corps combat photographer , Private Bob Campbell , captured this image as the original flag was lowered , and its larger replacement was raised Marine Corps photographer Sergeant Lou Lowery captured this first flag raising on film just as the enemy hurled a grenade in his direction .Dodging the grenade , Lowery hurled his body over the edge of the crater and tumbled 50 feet .His camera lens was shattered , but he and his film were safe .Three hours later another patrol was dispatched to raise another , larger flag .The battle for Iwo Jima is encapsulated by this historic flag raising atop Suribachi , which was captured on film by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal .His photo , seen around the world as a symbol of American values , would earn him many awards including the 1945 Pulitzer Prize .The 3d Marine Division joined the fighting on the fifth day of the battle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.97659"}

Hearney , Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps .\" That battle came to symbolize all that is good about our country and our Corps , \" Hearney said .\" The story should be told again and again to our children and our grandchildren .It is a story simply about courage .Among the crowd of 7 - 800 who attended were some Marines who had fought on Iwo Jima and emotions ran high that day .Tears where rolling down the deck of the ship as the crowd saw an important piece of history that had been lost for 50 years .Once again , the old monument came alive and it triggered something inside them .From 1995 to 2006 , the Monument held a place of honor aboard the Intrepid Museum and was seen by millions of visitors .Some called it the \u00d2soul\u00d3 of the museum .One knife still had a Japanese bullet stuck in the handle .\u00d2A 62-year - old sculpture of the flag - raising on Iwo Jima is getting the heave - ho from the museum on the aircraft carrier Intrepid while the ship is docked in Staten Island for an overhaul , museum officials and the sculpture\u00d5s owner said yesterday .The five - ton sculpture , which served as a model for the United States Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington , Va. , has been on display at the Intrepid Sea , Air and Space Museum since 1995 .But museum officials , who are starting to renovate the ship\u00d5s interior , said they declined to buy the sculpture from its owner , Rodney Hilton Brown , and asked him to remove it from the ship by September .\u00d3 .Intrepid Museum officials separately confirmed that : .As the Intrepid Museum prepares for its grand re - opening in fall 2008 , the Intrepid staff has been diligently working to return previously exhibited loans that are not focused on the Intrepid itself , to a variety of public and private lenders .Though many of these items are historically significant , monumental works such as the 1945 Iwo Jima statue are being returned to lenders .In returning the Iwo Jima Monument , the Intrepid Museum will afford other museums the opportunity to display this significant piece of American history .\u00d3 .The Monument gets crated and moved to storage for who knows how long .It was a scene reminiscent of the closing moments of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK , one of our country\u00d5s greatest national treasures was recently entombed in a wooden crate not that different from the Ark\u00d5s --- just a lot bigger .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.200294"}
{"text": "Not only was my expectation wrong but two other results emerged .First , seeing a woman in the news story actually decreased opposition to welfare spending .Second , exposure to a welfare queen in the news significantly increased support for negative characterizations of African - Americans by an average of 10 percent .Finally , I examined the racial effects by comparing those white viewers who were exposed to the white Rhonda and those who watched the welfare story featuring the black Rhonda .The general expectation was that exposure to the quintessential welfare queen script ( i.e. the black Rhonda ) would increase anti - black sentiments , heighten opposition to welfare spending , and lead more people to cite individual failing as the cause of welfare .The results were somewhat mixed .True to form , exposure to the full confirmation of the script ( i.e. black Rhonda ) increased opposition to welfare spending by five percent and showed a 10 percent rise in an attribution of cause to individual failings .Likewise , white participants who watched the welfare story with the black Rhonda were more likely to hold negative views of African - Americans than those who did have a visual cue .Contrary to expectations , however , exposure to the white Rhonda produced the biggest increase in anti - black sentiment .That is , watching a story with the white Rhonda increased negative depictions of blacks by 12 percent compared to the black Rhonda and by 23 percent over the story without a picture .One speculative explanation builds on results from other parts of this study .For instance , white subjects who watched the white version of the welfare story - compared to those who watched the black version - were most likely to see women as violating the \" family ethic \" of the story .Thus , in a perverse way , white women were \" privileged \" or valued in a way that African-American women are not .Most interestingly , people who espouse the most \" liberal \" views about gender roles turn out to be the most hostile to blacks when they are exposed to the white Rhonda .Put differently , the most gender - liberal white participants appear to be most likely to implicitly blame African - Americans for the plight of their racial peers , and there is early evidence to suggest that this tendency is most pronounced among women .This welfare queen experiment yields several important insights that pertain to media coverage .First , there is no doubt that there exists a narrative script about welfare that has taken on the imprimatur of common knowledge .Second , when this script is fully realized ( i.e. , with the black woman shown as the image ) it leads viewers to oppose welfare spending , cite individual attributions as causes for social problems , and endorse negative characterizations of African - Americans .And gender plays an intriguing role in all of this .Seeing any welfare story apparently makes viewers more supportive of traditional gender roles for women .But it is exposure to the white version of the welfare story that heightens support the most .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.13484"}

Rockey .Bombardment .Initial carrier raids against Iwo Jima began in June 1944 .Prior to the invasion , the 8-square - mile island would suffer the longest , most intensive shelling of any Pacific island during the war .The 7th Air Force , working out of the Marianas , supplied the B-24 heavy bombers for the campaign .In addition to the air assaults on Iwo , the Marines requested 10 days of pre - invasion naval bombardment .Due to other operational commitments and the fact that a prolonged air assault had been waged on Iwo Jima , Navy planners authorized only three days of naval bombardment .Unfavorable weather conditions would further hamper the effects of naval bombardment .Despite this , Turner decided to keep the invasion date as planned , and the Marines prepared for the Feb. 19 D - day .D - day .More than 450 ships massed off Iwo as the H - hour bombardment pounded the island .Shortly after 9 a.m. , Marines of the 4th and 5th divisions hit beaches Green , Red , Yellow and Blue abreast , initially finding little enemy resistance .Coarse volcanic sand hampered the movement of men and machines as they struggled to move up the beach .As the protective naval gunfire subsided to allow for the Marine advance , the Japanese emerged form their fortified underground positions to begin a heavy barrage of fire against the invading force .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "145.55206"}
