{"text": "Full Story President Obama plans to nominate James B. Comey , a former senior Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration , to replace Robert S. Mueller III as FBI director , according to two people with knowledge of the selection process .Comey , 52 , was at the center of some of the most bruising debates over counterterrorism during the Bush administration and established a reputation as a fierce defender of the law and the integrity of the Justice Department regardless of the political pressures of the moment .The expected nomination of Comey , a Republican , was seen in some quarters as a bipartisan move by a president besieged by Republicans in Congress .But Chuck Hagel 's prior service as a Republican senator from Nebraska did not spare him from a bruising nomination battle for secretary of defense .Mueller has served 12 years as FBI director , a period of enormous transformation for the bureau in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .The director 's term is limited by law to 10 years , but Congress unanimously approved Obama 's request in 2011 that Mueller be granted another two years .Comey was famously involved in a 2004 hospital - room confrontation with White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and the president 's chief of staff , Andrew H. Card Jr.The two White House officials were attempting to persuade Attorney General John D. Ashcroft , who was recovering from emergency surgery to remove his gallbladder , to reauthorize a controversial warrantless domestic eavesdropping program .Comey , who was acting attorney general in Ashcroft 's absence , had refused to agree to extend the program .When he learned that the White House was attempting to go around him and get the ill Ashcroft to sign off on an extension , Comey rushed to George Washington University Medical Center , arriving just before Gonzales and Card .Comey explained to Ashcroft what was happening and , when the White House officials arrived , the attorney general raised himself up and said he never should have authorized the program .He gestured at Comey and said , \" There is the attorney general , \" according to an account by former Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman .The White House had narrowed the search in recent days to Comey and Lisa Monaco , a former assistant attorney general for national security who became Obama 's chief counterterrorism adviser this year .One law enforcement source said that a few weeks ago , the Justice Department sent both names to the White House for consideration .Monaco would have been the first woman to lead the FBI , but Comey comes with extensive law enforcement experience .He served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan , and he was the managing assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the Richmond division of the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia .While in Richmond , he was credited with reducing the homicide rate by shifting gun prosecutions from state court to federal court , where the sentences were tougher .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.08627"}

Charles Schumer of New York , say they will even back Comey for attorney general if Gonzales resigns .\" The only thing worse than being vilified by the left , \" says Comey with a laugh , \" is being idolized by the left .\" But would Bush ever nominate him as AG ?Hell no , because Comey forced Bush to change his little program and then he publicly humilated Bush and his administration by testifying before Congress .( First to back the fired US Attorneys , and next to expose the Bush mafia tactics . )In fact , it was during the showdown in 2004 between the DoJ and the White House that Bush bestowed a derisive nickname on Comey .The angry reaction bubbled up all the way to the Oval Office .Perhaps Bush grudgingly respects Comey , but that grudging respect wo n't go too far .As Murray Waas wrote in his piece about how Bush personally helped Gonzales put the kibosh on the DoJ internal investigation into the warrantless domestic eavesdropping program , Mr. Comey was pretty high on Bush 's bad list .Even worse , in the view of Cheney and Addington , Goldsmith began to question the legality of various aspects of the NSA eavesdropping program .Goldsmith found a sympathetic ear and ally when James Comey was appointed deputy attorney general in late 2003 .A no - nonsense federal prosecutor who at the time of his appointment was the U.S. attorney general for the Southern District of Manhattan , Comey eschewed politics within an administration that demanded political loyalty , senior Justice officials recalled in interviews .Comey supported Goldsmith 's contentions that absent significant changes to the eavesdropping program , portions of it were illegal .Comey certainly would have been interviewed at length during the OPR probe , according to sources close to the investigation .Earlier , he had earned the enmity of some in the White House , a former senior administration official recalled in an interview , when Comey named a special prosecutor to investigate who leaked the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame to the media .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.23659"}

Bush was able to come in a close enough second to take the presidency due to irregularities in Florida and a friendly Supreme Court .This victory in 2000 , along with the 9/11 attack , gave Bush , as an incumbent during time of war , an edge which future Republican candidates are unlikely to enjoy .The current political divisions wo n't last in their current form forever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.246216"}
