{"text": "According to the source , Brittan had been attending a weekend house party somewhere in North Yorkshire ( he was initially MP for Cleveland & Whitby , then Richmond , N. Yorks ) : at some point he was supposed to have molested a young boy .Local police allegedly attended , but very quickly were ordered off the case by Special Branch officers .There were no details of where exactly this happened , nor what exactly Brittan was supposed to have done .Despite the sketchy nature of the rumour - and perhaps because I still lived in Yorkshire and had some relevant police contacts - I was instructed by my editor and the BBC 's ( then ) assistant director - general , Alan Protheroe , to make some discreet enquiries .Over several weeks I spoke to a succession of contacts within the police .All said they knew nothing .Finally , I approached an officer in the neighbouring West Yorkshire Police Special Branch with whom I had an occasional , if slightly uneasy , working relationship .He agreed - reluctantly - to make some enquiries : very quickly thereafter he told me he was not going to pursue them .And there our own investigations stopped .We told Alan Protheroe that we could find no evidence to support the rumour and I went back to work on more regular \" Checkpoint \" stories .We were not , of course , alone in hearing this rumour .Private Eye had also picked it up and subsequently ran a short piece suggesting that members of the security service were trying to smear Brittan with false child abuse allegations .Over the next decades I made a succession of films and wrote a number of books , investigating child sexual abuse and paedophile networks .But I rarely gave any thought to the Brittan allegations until claims about paedophile parties at the Elm Guest House in south - west London surfaced in late 2013 .A report on the Exaro news website , repeated in national newspapers and over the internet , claimed a video tape had been seized by Operation Fairbank ( later known as Fernbridge),the Metropolitan Police 's unit investigating allegations of historic \" VIP \" child sexual abuse .According to Exaro the tape showed a senior former Tory minister - plainly Brittan , though since he was still alive he was not named - in compromising circumstances at the guest house .I had a contact in Operation Fernbridge , Immediately after the story appeared , I met up with him : he denied absolutely - and vehemently - that any such tape had been seized .But because no official denial was issued by New Scotland Yard , the story fed into the growing public rumour - mill about ' paedophile politicians ' .Two further issues quickly emerged which further inflamed the mood .The first was the mystery over what had happened to a dossier given in 1984 to Leon Brittan ( while he was Home Secretary ) by a back - bench Conservative MP , Geoffrey Dickens .Newspapers at the time had reported that this dossier - which stemmed from Dickens ' earlier attempts to have the Paedophile Information Exchange proscribed - named a number of high - profile active child abusers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.04143"}

' ' Adults use more sophisticated terms to describe the sexual games the children were reported to have played with trusted teachers , such as pedophilia , felony child abuse , child pornography .Despite stricter laws against the sexual abuse of children , three cases pending in Los Angeles alone indicate that trafficking in children for pleasure or profit has not disappeared .Seven defendants , including 76-year- old Virginia McMartin , who founded the school in 1956 ; her daughter , granddaughter and grandson , are scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court .They face a total of 115 counts of having sexual relations with children as young as 2 years old at the preschool center in suburban Manhattan Beach .Prosecutors say 125 children have told therapists that snapshots and movies were made while they were raped , sodomized , orally copulated or fondled .Mrs. McMartin , in a wheelchair when she surrendered on the March 22 indictments , termed the charges against her ' ' a bunch of lies . ' ' Attorneys for the others in the case told the judge reviewing their bail amounts that they were upstanding citizens .No pornographic photographs or films have been recovered in the McMartin case , but Deputy District Attorney Eleanor Barrett says she believes some were made ' ' because so many children talk about being photographed on so many occasions . ' ' Bond Money May Be Issue .One issue at the hearing will be whether anything the defendants might post for bail , cash or property was obtained through the sale of pornographic material .Four of the seven are free on bond .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.920845"}

{"text": "Therefore none of the evidence being collected by Operation Midland - nor the documentary evidence already held by Operation Fernbridge ( let alone the enquiries still being made by North Yorkshire and Scotland Yard detectives into the mysterious house party rumour ) - will ever be produced in court .There is only one forum now in which the allegations about Leon Brittan can publicly be examined : Lord Justice Goddard 's Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse .This week I formally asked the Inquiry 's press office the following questions : .Has the Inquiry yet established direct contact with Operation Fernbridge ?Will the Inquiry be examining documentary evidence held by Operation Fernbridge concerning its investigations into the late Baron Brittan ?Specifically , will the Inquiry secure from Operation Fernbridge copies of all such documents including , but not limited to , formal statements made under caution , officers ' notebooks , internal memoranda and historical documents acquired during its investigation into the late Baron Brittan ?Does the Inquiry plan to require public testimony from the current head of Operation Fernbridge , AND its former senior investigating officer , [ NAME REDACTED HERE ] concerning the late Baron Brittan ?Does the Inquiry plan to require public testimony from the former Customs and Excise officer Maganlal Solanki who gave evidence to Operation Fernbridge concerning the alleged seizure of child pornography from the late Baron Brittan ?Does the Inquiry plan to take evidence from the US Marshall formerly attached to Operation Fernbridge in connection with a visit he made at the request of Operation Fernbridge to a suspected victim of Baron Brittan ?Does the Inquiry plan to publish the documents acquired and/or generated by Operation Fernbridge during the course of its investigation into Baron Brittan ?The Inquiry has yet to provide a response .The long , strange saga of Leon Brittan is a litmus test of how rigorous and open Lord Justice Godard 's enquiry intends be .The enquiry must summons - as it has the power to do - Mr. Solanki and the officers from operation Fernbridge to give evidence on oath .It must also obtain all the statements taken by Fernbridge which relate to Brittan .Leon Brittan was no obscure politician or ordinary Cabinet Minister .For more than two years he occupied one of the three great offices of state : Home Secretary .Unquestionably , he should have been subjected to positive vetting by MI5 before being appointed : Goddard must insist on seeing those vetting reports .She must also discover what , if any , subsequent vetting took place before David Cameron appointed Brittan as a trade advisor in 2010 .And , just as crucially , she must reveal all of this evidence to the public which is , after all , paying for the Inquiry .There remain , too , legitimate and unanswered questions about Brittan 's opposition to proscribing the Paedophile Information Exchange ( and indeed about PIE 's alleged involvement with the Home Office itself while he was a Minister Of State there between 1979 and 1981 ) .If it does not , then the public will have every right to doubt the integrity of the Goddard enquiry - and to question why substantial sums of public money are being devoted to a series of police investigations which will never see the light of day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.44893"}

'Father Tony McSweeney has been found guilty on 4 charges .One count indecent assault and three counts of making indecent images of a child .He was found not guilty on four other charges .That might be the end of Operation Fernbridge and it will be interesting to see if the police or CPS comment .I 'll wait and see if they do before commenting myself in more detail about Grafton Close and Elm Guest House .I 've a message for them ; .The police will not be cowed by establishment pressure from political has - beens .The police will not be given the bum 's rush because friends of a person who has come under police investigation think that he will be exonerated if more information is made public prematurely .The Tories claim to be the party of law and order .That espoused respect for the law seems to be distinctly absent as they use the power of the Tory media to put pressure on the police with these juvenile responses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "130.24718"}
