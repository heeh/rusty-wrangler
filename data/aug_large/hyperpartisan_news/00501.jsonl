{"text": "Islam has yet to \" completely be made over . \"Renowned Muslim historian and philosopher Ibn Khaldun ( d. 1406 ) explained jihad as follows : .In the Muslim community , jihad is a religious duty because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and the obligation to convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force .The other religious groups did not have a universal mission , and the jihad was not a religious duty for them , save only for purposes of defense .But Islam is under obligation to gain power over other nations .Here it 's worth noting that even the most offensive jihad is seen as an \" altruistic \" endeavor , not unlike the \" white man 's burden \" of the 19 th century .After all , the ancient argument that \" we must reform your ways , with our ways , for your own good \" has been one of the most cited justifications for offensive jihad since the 7 th century .Indeed , soon after the death of Islam 's prophet Muhammad ( 634 ) , when his jihadis burst out of the Arabian peninsula , a soon - to - be conquered Persian commander asked the invading Muslims what they wanted .They reportedly replied as follows : .He has sent us to bring his religion to all his creatures and call them to Islam .Whoever accepts it from us will be safe , and we shall leave him alone ; but whoever refuses , we shall fight until we fulfill the promise of Allah .Fourteen hundred years later , in March 2009 , Saudi legal expert Basem Alem publicly echoed this view : .This is the true meaning of offensive jihad .When we wage jihad , it is not in order to convert people to Islam , but in order to liberate them from the dark slavery in which they live .Even al - Qaeda partially justified its jihad against America for being \" a nation that exploits women like consumer products \" ; for not rejecting the \" immoral acts of fornication , homosexuality , intoxicants , gambling , and usury .\" This positive interpretation of jihad ensures that , no matter how violent and ostensibly unjust a jihad is , it will always be vindicated in Muslim eyes : the ugly means will be justified by the \" altruistic \" ends .Finally , as Grand Ayatollah Ahmad al - Baghdadi pointed out , the need for Muslims to wage offensive jihad \" is not the opinion of Ahmad al - Husseini al - Baghdadi ...This is the word of Allah ! \" Nor is it the \" opinion \" of ISIS Caliph Abu Bakr , al - Qaeda leader Ayman Zawahiri , Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau , or any of the other countless past and present jihadis .No , jihad to conquer and bring Sharia to non - Muslims is the command of Allah .Women sold as slaves .Women beaten in the streets .Women raped for sport .Girls as young as 8 or 9 years old forced into marriages with strangers , and bound to sexual servitude .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.521286"}
