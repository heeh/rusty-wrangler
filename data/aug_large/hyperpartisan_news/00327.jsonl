{"text": "Here 's my analysis : Basically , in general , whites were just barely against Prop 8 ( 49 - 51 ) while Latinos were just barely for Prop 8 , but by a little more ( 53 - 47 ) .But blacks were 70 - 30 in favor of prop 8 .BUT , and this it the big BUT , blacks were only 10 percent of the vote ( while whites are 63 % and Latinos are 18%--everybody else was pretty much split 50 - 50 ) .And , now here 's where it gets interesting .According to the exit poll , the final overall split was 51.88 ( for ) to 49.12 ( against ) .So , if the blacks had voted the same as the latinos ( 53 % in favor ) , it still would have just passed 50.18 ( for ) to 49.82 ( against ) .BUT , if blacks had voted in the same way as whites ( just barely against Prop 8) , the measure would have just barely failed 49.78 ( for ) to 50.22 ( against ) .Now that I 've done this , I realize this is n't really the answer to your question .What if blacks voted on Prop 8 in the same proportion ( 70 - 30 )BUT they turned out at the percentage they normally would turn out .I did research and blacks in California generally turn out at about 6.5 percent ( rather than the 10 percent they turned out in this election ) .SOOOOOO , if we calculate blacks turning out and their normal percentage , the end result would be Prop 8 would still be 51.21 ( for ) to 48.79 ( against ) .So , basically , the CONCLUSION is : .Getting more blacks out to vote did not affect the outcome of Prop 8 .If , however , blacks were less anti - gay marriage , the Prop could have been Voted NO and would have failed .Interesting , eh ?All this being said , this was all of exit poll numbers , so all these things are pretty close , but I think my conclusion basically still stands .I do n't disagree with your defense .You say that if less Evangelicals voted for 8 then it would n't have passed , so why single out blacks ?I think the black vote is getting so much attention because many people view 8 as a civil rights issue and , rightfully or wrongfully , had an expectation that blacks would too .I think the interesting thing about this is that Obama won handily in the state .I hear a lot of blame given to the Mormons and conservatives - but it appears that a lot of democratic voters are the ones to blame for the initiative passing .I do n't know necessarily about racial breakdowns , but I also know a lot of GOP voters in California that voted \" no \" on the initiative - so not all conservatives were voting \" yes \" on the issue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.492325"}
