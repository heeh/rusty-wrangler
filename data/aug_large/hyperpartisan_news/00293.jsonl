Bush was .Federal tax rates have declined steadily for a generation , and declined sharply in the past decade .A declining federal tax burden for most people , rather than higher federal spending , is the core reason for skyrocketing deficits -- though spending surely is rising , too .Commentators who use the phrase \" tax and spend \" to describe Obama either do n't understand recent political history or are n't being honest .Federal income tax rates were cut by John Kennedy in the early 1960s , by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s ; rose slightly under the elder George Bush ; were cut twice under the younger Bush , and cut again by Obama last winter .Capital - gains tax rates have declined too ; Social Security and Medicare taxes ( \" payroll taxes \" ) were raised by Reagan and by Bill Clinton , although not enough to fully fund either program , meaning those taxes are lower than they need to be for fiscal discipline .This chart shows the decline of the federal top rate , to less than half of what it was under Dwight Eisenhower .The younger Bush was hammered in the press because his two tax cuts reduced the rate paid by the rich : But the same cuts nearly eliminated federal income taxes on the working class and lower middle class .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.61039"}
