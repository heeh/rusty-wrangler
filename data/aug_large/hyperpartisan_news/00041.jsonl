Jay Nixon .The protest demonstrations last night , which were the largest so far in Ferguson , went off completely peacefully .After four nights of heavy - handed military style policing , a relaxed atmosphere replaced the war zone atmosphere of the previous nights .Missouri Highway patrol Captain Ronald Johnson walked through the crowds , at one point apologizing for the behavior of police who had attacked and tear - gassed people the night before .He said the Highway Patrol police would continue a more respectful tone with protesters .On Friday a six - year veteran of the Ferguson police force , Darren Wilson , was identified as the policeman who killed the unarmed Black teenager , touching off the protests and the heavy - handed military style police response .The release today of the name of the policeman who did the shooting meets one of the major demands demonstrators were making last night , as they had for several days before .The police also said , when they made that announcement , that Brown was a suspect in a convenience store robbery .They allege that he took a box of candy swisher cigars .Police said that the officer who filled out an incident report when he saw Brown 's body in the street , four hours after he was shot , had compared what he saw there with video surveillance tape from the convenience store .The community in Ferguson is at the very least skeptical about the release of these tapes four days after the killing .Brown 's family , through their attorney on Friday , urged that protests continue but that they remain peaceful .Brown 's friend , Dorian Johnson , was with Brown the night he was shot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.353745"}

Board of Education , which desegregated all - white schools throughout the country .Last year , activists in the Jacksonville Progressive Coalition led a successful campaign to change the name of Forrest High School , despite much protest from wealthy racist whites in the city .The murders of Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis , along with the incarceration of Marissa Alexander , speak to the continued presence of laws in the Black Belt that specifically oppress the African American nation .Florida 's state government , much like other state governments around the U.S. South , is controlled by the Republican Party , which generally represents the far - right sector of the capitalist class .This sector profits from exploiting agricultural workers and other workers in labor - intensive industries , meaning they materially profit from the brutal racism and national oppression of African Americans .Laws like Stand Your Ground , while nominally defending the right of self - defense , are applied in Florida to empower white racist vigilantes like Dunn and Zimmerman , while denying the same rights to African American women like Alexander who defend themselves from domestic abuse .The hypocrisy is n't simply misguided lawyers and judges .Instead , it is a fundamental part of oppressing African Americans in the Black Belt on the basis of nationality .Like modern Afghanistan or Iraq under U.S. occupation , the U.S. imperialist ruling class writes laws and enforces its policies on the African American nation for the purpose of making itself richer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.07106"}

{"text": "In the face of this \" mo ' money , mo ' problems \" scenario , China continues to denounce its critics , showing no signs of conciliation .For their part , protestors doggedly refuse to let their numerous complaints die down .Such is the impasse that the controversy occasioned by the appearance of the Olympic torch seems , at this point , to be merely a rehearsal for what might happen once the games begin .And yet , there are those who would suggest that this brouhaha is misplaced .Most prominent among them is US President George Bush .While Germany 's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Britain 's Prime Minister Gordon Brown have declined to attend the games ' opening ceremonies - registering clear , if non - verbal , opposition to China 's human rights record - as of this writing , Bush has been less forthcoming about his plans to attend .If recent comments are any indication , however , he will have a front row seat .Through his national security adviser , Stephen Hadley , Bush has said that skipping the games is \" a cop - out\"-a characteristically colloquial and cryptic assertion that flips the situation on its ear .Hadley went on to suggest that \" quiet diplomacy \" is needed to bring about true change .Detractors might suggest that the true cop - out comes in a refusal to act , excused in lieu of an unspecified and unqualified commitment to action at some time as yet to be determined .However , Bush has given other , more illuminating , reasons for his refusal to skip the ceremonies , saying \" I do n't view the Olympics as a political event .I view it as a sporting event .\" Bush 's argument is not a new one .Yet its invocation here reveals just how wrong - headed and reductive this age - old assertion is .To call this notion utopian would be to suggest that it describes a situation as ideal as it is impossible .And , while even a passing knowledge of Olympic history ( or the history of any major sport ) confirms the fiction of separating sports and politics , keeping them apart is far from an ideal to strive for .The distinction between sports and politics is , of course , a blurry line at best .Anyone who 's attended a live sporting event in America can attest to the requisite Pledge of Allegiance kicking things off .It 's not that sports allows us to escape politics per se , then , but rather they tend to suppress oppositional politics .A football player running onto the field waving an American flag might seem apolitical , but that 's only because the vast majority tend to agree with his political sentiments .When , for example , Denver Nugget guard Mahmoud Abdul - Rauf refused to stand for the pledge as a sign of protest , he was quickly shouted down by the NBA and its fans .The distance between politics and sports , then , has more to do with popular expectations of athletes , rather than the very likely existence of their own beliefs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.62242"}

{"text": "We are all still Trayvon Martin .February 26 , 2013 .On February 26 , 2012 , 17-year - old Trayvon Martin was walking back from the store through a mostly white gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford when he was stalked and stopped by a self - appointed neighborhood watchman , George Zimmerman .Minutes later , Trayvon was dead of a gunshot wound .It took some weeks for the story of Trayvon 's murder to capture national attention , but when it did , it was a galvanizing event , drawing attention to the fact that racism was alive and well in 21st century America .Anti - racist protests took place around the country , calling for justice for Trayvon , but also casting a spotlight on other instances of racist violence , particularly those carried out by police .On the one - year anniversary of Trayvon Martin 's death , Khury Petersen - Smith reflects on the crime and the national and international outrage against racism that it spurred .ONE YEAR after the murder of 17-year - old Trayvon Martin by vigilante George Zimmerman in Sanford , Florida , it is worth taking stock of what this racist crime and the events that followed taught us about race in the U.S. today .Perhaps more than anything else , the idea that the U.S. had somehow become , since the election of the country 's first Black president , a post - racial society was shattered in ways that no one but the most bigoted , delusional people could deny .It was partially the starkness of the crime -- and the decisions of cops and town officials afterward -- that inspired so much anger and unabashed support for Trayvon and his family .But instead of focusing on the racism of cops and officials in a small and backward Southern town , we should remember the reaction outside of Sanford as well .Instead of springing into action to cover an obvious hate crime , in which the murderer was allowed to walk free , the national news media ignored the case of Trayvon Martin -- until the protests of students at Florida public universities .The weeks that followed witnessed racist hate inspired by support for George Zimmerman in plainly Northern cities like Columbus , Ohio , where the exterior of the Hale Black Cultural Center at Ohio State University was vandalized with pro - Zimmerman graffiti .However , the most powerful feature of the aftermath of Trayvon 's murder was the outpouring of protest in cities across the country .Tens of thousands of people -- mostly African American -- mobilized in outrage at the murder of Trayvon , the fact that his killer was protected by cops and politicians , and the bitter knowledge that any Black youth could easily suffer Trayvon 's fate .Trayvon 's murder opened up a national conversation about the racist murder of Black people , by vigilantes and law enforcement .Police murders of African Americans in cities and towns across the country , previously treated as \" local news , \" came to be understood as the local symptoms of a rampant , national problem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "128.3136"}
