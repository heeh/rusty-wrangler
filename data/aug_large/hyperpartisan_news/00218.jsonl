{"text": "So the Kremlin will be actively engaged in two different election campaigns this year .First in March , it will be struggling to reinsert Vladimir Putin into office as president for life , and then in November it will be struggling even harder to make sure that Putin 's patsy , Barack Obama , gets to remain in the White House .Its principle strategy will be to threaten Americans with World War III unless they choose Obama .Meanwhile , Putin is launching an all - out attack on his opponents inside Russia , for instance releasing a video comparing demonstration leader Aleksei Navalny to Adolf Hitler .Another opposition leader , Sergei Mitrokhin , was arrested during a protest action .It 's a sign of things to come .Once he 's president for life and has Obama safely re - ensconced in Washington , Putin will be free to launch a final crackdown on Russian civil society and wipe out any chance that the Arab spring could spread to Russia .Having done so , Putin can continue his foreign policy , which amounts to raking in a bounty of unilateral concessions from Obama , including WTO admission and the abandonment of missile defense in Eastern Europe , meanwhile forging ahead with aggressive policies in the Middle East .In Russia 's behavior , we see proven the fact that one can deal with a bully only through strength .Russia has understood Obama 's \" reset \" proposal and his unilateral concessions only as weakness , and Putin has responded with more and more aggression both at home and abroad .Only if Obama is ousted from office by a Republican who understands the lessons taught by Ronald Reagan will there be any hope for Russia or for American interests where Russia is concerned .Russia and the Cyber Threat .Please see the glossary for an explanation of terms used in this document .Cyber security is becoming a buzzword in the public understanding of national security .In November 2008 , computer - based attacks on the Department of Defense , Department of State , and White House made national news .In August 2008 , cyber attacks on Georgia , originating in Russia , were widely reported and debated .Though public awareness of these attacks is recent , professional attention has focused on cyber threats for much longer .The first presidential commission to report on the potential for a cyber threat to national security was in 1998 , and in 2001 , President George W. Bush declared cyber security a national priority .In July 2008 , then - presidential candidate Barack Obama showed similar concern about cyber security , vowing to declare the American . \" cyber infrastructure a strategic asset \" should he become president .While the narrow definition of cyberspace refers strictly to the Internet , the application of a more comprehensive definition that includes all forms of networked and digital activities is more appropriate when addressing issues of cyber security .While cyber crimes and cyber attacks are both easily defined , distinguishing cyber warfare and cyber terrorism from them is difficult .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.679306"}
