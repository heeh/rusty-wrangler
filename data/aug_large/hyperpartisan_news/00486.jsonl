{"text": "First , are the provisions of the clause exclusive - that is , does it provide the only way that the United States may enter into international obligations ?Article I , Section 10 , in describing restrictions upon the states , speaks of \" Treat[ies ] \" and \" Agreement[s] ... with a foreign Power \" as two distinct categories .Some scholars believe this shows that not all international agreements are treaties , and that these other agreements would not need to go through the procedures of the Treaty Clause .Instead , the President , in the exercise of his executive power , could conclude such agreements on his own .Still , this exception for lesser agreements would have to be limited to \" agreements \" of minor importance , or else it would provide too great an avenue for evasion of the protections the Framers placed in the Treaty Clause .A second question is how the President and Senate should interact in their joint exercise of the treaty power .Many Framers apparently thought that the President would oversee the actual conduct of diplomacy , but that the Senate would be involved from the outset as a sort of executive council advising the President .This was likely a reason that the Framers thought the smaller Senate was more suited than the House to play a key role in treaty - making .In the first effort at treaty - making under the Constitution , President George Washington attempted to operate in just this fashion .He went to the Senate in person to discuss a proposed treaty before he began negotiations .What is less clear , however , is whether the Constitution actually requires this process , or whether it is only what the Framers assumed would happen .The Senate , of course , is constitutionally authorized to offer \" advice \" to the President at any stage of the treaty - making process , but the President is not directed ( in so many words ) as to when advice must be solicited .As we shall see , this uncertainty has led , in modern practice , to a very different procedure than some Framers envisioned .It seems clear , however , that the Framers expected that the Senate 's \" advice and consent \" would be a close review and not a mere formality , as they thought of it as an important check upon presidential power .A third difficult question is whether the Treaty Clause implies a Senate power or role in treaty termination .Scholarly opinion is divided , and few Framers appear to have discussed the question directly .One view sees the power to make a treaty as distinct from the power of termination , with the latter being more akin to a power of implementation .Since the Constitution does not directly address the termination power , this view would give it to the President as part of the President 's executive powers to conduct foreign affairs and to execute the laws .When the termination question first arose in 1793 , Washington and his Cabinet , which included Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson , embraced this view .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.638405"}

Belmont ( 1937 ) ; United States v. Pink ( 1942 ) .But the scope of this independent presidential power remains a serious question .The Pink and Belmont cases involved agreements relating to the recognition of a foreign government , a power closely tied to the President 's textual power to receive ambassadors ( Article II , Section 3 ) .The courts have consistently permitted the President to settle foreign claims by sole executive agreement , but at the same time have emphasized that the Congress has acquiesced in the practice .Dames & Moore v. Regan ( 1981 ) ; American Insurance Ass'n v. Garamendi ( 2003 ) .Beyond this , the modern limits of the President 's ability to act independently in making international agreements have not been explored .With respect to treaty termination , modern practice allows the President to terminate treaties on his own .In recent times , President James Earl Carter terminated the U.S.-Taiwan Mutual Defense Treaty in 1977 , and President George W.

{"text": "Most people of the time recognized the actual conduct of diplomacy as an executive function , but under Article VI treaties were , like statutes , part of the \" supreme Law of the Land . \"Thus , as Alexander Hamilton explained in The Federalist No . 75 , the two branches were appropriately combined : .Another reason for involving both President and Senate was that the Framers thought American interests might be undermined by treaties entered into without proper reflection .The Framers believed that treaties should be strictly honored , both as a matter of the law of nations and as a practical matter , because the United States could not afford to give the great powers any cause for war .But this meant that the nation should be doubly cautious in accepting treaty obligations .As James Wilson said , \" Neither the President nor the Senate , solely , can complete a treaty ; they are checks upon each other , and are so balanced as to produce security to the people .The fear of disadvantageous treaties also underlay the Framers ' insistence on approval by a two - thirds majority of the Senate .In particular , the Framers worried that one region or interest within the nation , constituting a bare majority , would make a treaty advantageous to it but prejudicial to other parts of the country and to the national interest .An episode just a year before the start of the Convention had highlighted the problem .The United States desired a trade treaty with Spain , and sought free access to the Mississippi River through Spanish - controlled New Orleans .Spain offered favorable trade terms , but only if the United States would give up its demands on the Mississippi .The Northern states , which would have benefited most from the trade treaty and cared little about New Orleans , had a majority , but not a supermajority , in the Continental Congress .Under the Articles of Confederation , treaties required assent of a supermajority ( nine out of thirteen ) of the states , and the South was able to block the treaty .It was undoubtedly that experience that impelled the Framers to carry over the supermajority principle from the Articles of Confederation .At the Convention , several prominent Framers argued unsuccessfully to have the House of Representatives included .But most delegates thought that the House had substantial disadvantages when it came to treaty - making .For example , as a large body , the House would have difficulty keeping secrets or acting quickly .The small states , wary of being disadvantaged , also preferred to keep the treaty - making power in the Senate , where they had proportionally greater power .The ultimate purpose , then , of the Treaty Clause was to ensure that treaties would not be adopted unless most of the country stood to gain .True , treaties would be more difficult to adopt than statutes , but the Framers realized that an unwise statute could simply be repealed , but an unwise treaty remained a binding international commitment , which would not be so easy to unwind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.01048"}

Carter , [ 10 ] Congress challenged the constitutionality of then - president Jimmy Carter 's unilateral termination of a defense treaty . \" In his opinion , Justice Brennan dissented , \" The issue of decision making authority must be resolved as a matter of constitutional law , not political discretion ; accordingly , it falls within the competence of the courts \" .[ 11 ] .Scope of presidential powers .Presidents have regarded the Article II treaty process as necessary where an international accord would bind a future president .For example , Theodore Roosevelt explained : .The Constitution did not explicitly give me power to bring about the necessary agreement with Santo Domingo .But the Constitution did not forbid my doing what I did .I put the agreement into effect , and I continued its execution for two years before the Senate acted ; and I would have continued it until the end of my term , if necessary , without any action by Congress .But it was far preferable that there should be action by Congress , so that we might be proceeding under a treaty which was the law of the land and not merely by a direction of the Chief Executive which would lapse when that particular executive left office .I therefore did my best to get the Senate to ratify what I had done .[ 12 ] .[ 1 ] Agreements beyond these competencies must have the approval of Congress ( for congressional - executive agreements ) or the Senate ( for treaties ) .In 1972 , Congress passed legislation requiring the president to notify Congress of any executive agreements that are formed .[ 13 ] .The constitutionality of this delegation was upheld by the Supreme Court in Field v. Clark ( 1892 ) .Jump up ^ The Supreme Court has said that the words \" treaty \" and \" agreement \" were technical terms of international diplomacy , when the Constitution was written .152 , says : ' A treaty , in Latin foedus , is a compact made with a view to the public welfare , by the superior power , either for perpetuity , or for a considerable time .

{"text": "The terminology here comes from \" The Gamble \" - an excellent book on the 2012 election by George Washington University Professor John Sides and UCLA Professor Lynn Vavreck .Sides and Vavreck studied the 2012 Republican primary and found that many of the candidates who enjoyed a brief moment atop the polls did so because of a media \" discovery , scrutiny and decline \" pattern .In the discovery phase , a relatively unknown candidate does something that attracts the attention of journalists ( e.g. Herman Cain winning the Florida Straw Poll ) .These journalists become fascinated with that candidate , write a ream of stories about him or her ( often neutral - to - positive in tone ) and as a result that candidate rises in the polls .These same journalists then write positive stories about that candidate 's rise , and the candidate rockets to an even higher position .Thursday 's debate could focus the media 's attention on a new candidate .For example , if Ohio Gov. John Kasich has a breakout performance in the main debate or if Carly Fiorina dominates the second - tier candidate debate earlier in the evening , the media could \" discover \" them and cause a subsequent rise in the polls .Of course , this might not happen , but a good debate performance provides a plausible springboard for a media - fueled poll bounce .It 's also possible that this debate kicks off the \" scrutiny \" phase of Trump 's candidacy .According to Sides and Vavreck , scrutiny happens after the candidate has had some time atop the polls and journalists decide to really dig into their public record and personal history .Right now Trump is firmly in the discovery phase of his candidacy .The media are still treating him as more of a celebrity than a candidate , so his policy positions and his past are getting less attention than his performance in the latest poll or his most recent bombastic statement .If the media and party establishment begin to scrutinize Trump in the way they would any other politician , it may lead to bad press and a related drop in his poll numbers - the beginning of the \" decline \" in Sides and Vavreck 's process .That 's not to say that Trump will definitely be scrutinized after the debate .And the scrutiny may have a muted or delayed effect - part of Trump 's appeal is his aggression towards the mainstream media and political establishment .But it is possible that the debate marks a turning point in how Trump is viewed - and if that 's the case , then it has potentially huge consequences .Third , and perhaps most importantly , many voters will be really introduced to these candidates for the first time .While the party and the media play a large role in influencing voters , voters themselves matter the most .There are a massive number of ways any one candidate could leverage the debate to speak to his or her desired coalition in a persuasive way , so it 's harder to play these scenarios out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.14317"}

{"text": "A second view holds that , as a matter of the general eighteenth - century understanding of the legal process , the power to take an action ( such as passing a statute or making a treaty ) implies the power to undo the action .This view would require the consent of the President and a supermajority of the Senate to undo a treaty .There is , however , not much historical evidence that many Framers actually held this view of treaty termination , and it is inconsistent with the common interpretation of the Appointments Clause ( under which Senate approval is required to appoint but not to remove executive officers ) .The third view is that the Congress as a whole has the power to terminate treaties , based on an analogy between treaties and federal laws .When the United States first terminated a treaty in 1798 under John Adams , this procedure was adopted , but there was little discussion of the constitutional ramifications .Finally , there is a question of the limits of the treaty power .A treaty presumably can not alter the constitutional structure of government , and the Supreme Court has said that executive agreements - and so apparently treaties - are subject to the limits of the Bill of Rights just as ordinary laws are .Reid v.
