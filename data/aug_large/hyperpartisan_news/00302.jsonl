Norm Coleman , who has become prominent among Republican critics of Bush 's war policy , told me from his home state of Minnesota that he would oppose deauthorization and predicted that no more than two Republican senators would vote for it .One of those two Republican senators would have to be Nebraska 's Chuck Hagel , who has fearlessly critiqued Bush 's war policy .But Hagel told me that he is not inclined to support a repeal .If Hagel is lost , Democrats might fall short of the 50 votes necessary for final passage , much less the 60 necessary to close off debate .George W. Bush may be an unpopular president fighting an unpopular war , but Democrats are finding it hard to make war policy from Capitol Hill .Democrats do not cloak the political nature of their efforts .Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph Biden , participating in a Nevada forum for Democratic presidential candidates last week , exultantly announced to applause his intent to \" revoke the president 's authority that he was given . . .to go to war .\" The mantra is not limited to the presidential hopefuls from the Senate .On the campaign trail in New Hampshire , Gov.

John Carter ( R - Texas ) , to put the brakes on ICE 's abortion funding .Last Wednesday , Congressman Carter , Chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee , introduced language to stop the agency 's $ 46 billion funding bill from getting bogged down with the President 's radical social policy .Under the Carter amendment , co - sponsored by our friends Reps .Robert Aderholt ( R - Ala . ) and Rep. Alan Nunnelee , ( R - Miss . ) , Homeland Security would be barred from spending a single cent of government funding on abortion .The Committee passed a similar rider last year , but -- like most appropriations measures -- the abortion ban did n't carry over from the 2013 funding bill .A day after Rep. Carter offered the amendment , it passed : 25 - 21 .Now it heads to the House floor -- along with the rest of the 92-page budget .\" I will always support and remain committed to preserving the sanctity of life , \" Carter vowed , \" and as a committed member of the Pro - Life Caucus , I will continue to defend human life at all stages .The provision in this amendment will continue to ensure that federal taxpayer dollars will not fund abortion . \"Meanwhile , Planned Parenthood , who never met an abortion debate it did n't like to distort , criticized the bill for denying access to immigrant abortions .In a press release , the country 's biggest abortion cartel intentionally mischaracterized Carter 's amendment , claiming that it \" prevents immigrant women ... from making extremely personal , medical decisions . \"False .It only prevents taxpayers from funding those decisions .Women in ICE 's custody are not only free to abort at outside clinics -- they're assigned government \" escorts \" for the trip .All House leaders have done is bring Homeland Security in line with the other federal appropriations provisions that block taxpayer dollars for abortion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.927826"}
