{"text": "No Analytical Basis for Set Aside .Neither the concept of a set aside nor the mechanism for calculating the set aside ever has had a solid analytical basis .For example , neither UC nor CSU has had a consistent policy regarding what \" new \" fee revenue counts toward the set aside .Some years , for example , CSU has counted fee revenue generated from enrollment growth toward the set aside whereas other years it has counted only fee revenue generated from fee increases .Similarly , in the budget year , both segments suggest they will set aside fee revenue associated with the proposed systemwide fee increase but not the proposed excess unit surcharge .Moreover , the precise percentage of additional fee revenue set aside for aid has varied over time .For example , from 1990 - 91 through 1993 - 94 , UC set aside a different percentage each year ( gradually increasing from 20 percent to 32 percent ) .In short , the general notion as well as specific calculation for the set aside has changed frequently and unpredictably .Large Growth in Institutional Aid in Current Year .The set aside also has resulted in exceptionally large increases to UC and CSU 's institutional aid budgets .Figure 9 shows the growth in UC and CSU 's institutional aid budgets between 2002 - 03 and 2003 - 04 .As the figure shows , during this brief period , despite the state 's difficult fiscal situation , these aid budgets grew dramatically .The UC 's institutional aid budget grew by $ 118 million , or 50 percent , whereas CSU 's SUG budget grew by $ 76 million , or 66 percent .Exceptional Augmentations Disconnected From Actual Need .The current year was anomalous in that UC and CSU 's institutional aid budgets increased to reflect both slightly higher than normal enrollment growth and large fee increases .These factors led to a substantial increase in student fee revenue , and one - third of this increase was redirected to institutional aid programs .Although the additional students and higher fees undoubtedly increased the total financial need of students at UC and CSU , the actual size of the augmentations was entirely disconnected from any measure of actual need .Moreover , the augmentations were much greater than needed to hold UC and CSU 's aid budgets harmless .Indeed , the sizeable augmentations resulted in both substantially more students receiving awards - in excess of enrollment growth - and substantially larger awards - in excess of that needed to cover the fee increases .For example , at CSU , the number of SUG recipients grew by 16 percent between 2002 - 03 and 2003 - 04-considerably more than the 4 percent enrollment growth CSU achieved .Similarly , the average SUG award grew by 43 percent - noticeably more than CSU 's 35 percent fee increases .Below , we focus specifically on the Governor 's budget proposal to further expand UC and CSU 's undergraduate institutional aid programs .Because the state currently does not have a comparable Cal Grant - like program for graduate students , we do not have the same concerns with the Governor 's budget proposal for graduate institutional aid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.71054"}
