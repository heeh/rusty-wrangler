{"text": "BuzzFeed Kisses Ring of House Leaders Who Purged Conservatives .Ben Smith 's BuzzFeed is stumping on behalf of the House members responsible for the purge of top conservatives from committee leadership .They 're accomplishing that trick by having staffers for those House members praise each other .BuzzFeed then reports those comments as evidence that all these House members are tremendous contributors to the Congress .Sunday , BuzzFeed ran a story titled \" 23 People Who Will Be Running Washington Next Year . \"BuzzFeed names figures like House Speaker John Boehner 's press secretary Michael Steel and House Majority Whip Rep.
