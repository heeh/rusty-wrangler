{"text": "( Samantha Clemens / Las Vegas Review - Journal ) .The bride was blushing .She wore a blue print dress and a jean jacket .The groom looked bemused .Like most grooms , his eyes appeared glazed .He wore a white shirt with a black pattern , jeans , and black skate shoes with the letters DC on the side in green .The groomsman just looked fast .He had on a black polo shirt with the M&M 'S logo over the breast pocket .The groomsman was Kyle Busch , who has won 28 NASCAR Cup races and finished a career - high fourth in the points last season .A couple of weeks ago , after Crystal and Bobby decided they would get married , Crystal wrote Las Vegas Motor Speedway .She indicated that she loved Kyle Busch almost as much as she loved her fiance and that they were planning to get married , in October .Crystal , who is a veterinary assistant in Palm Desert , Calif. , when she 's not watching Kyle Busch drive around in circles , was out wrangling a pony when the speedway called back .They said the Goody 's Headache Relief Shot 500 was in October in Martinsville , Va. , and three other races were scheduled in October , and all of these races were part of the Chase for the Sprint Cup .So chances were that Kyle was going to be a little busy then .But the speedway people were bringing him to town on Jan. 21 , to help spur ticket sales for the Kobalt 400 at LVMS on March 9 .If the happy couple would consider moving the wedding up , perhaps they could say something to Kyle .If truth be known , the speedway was going to arrange for somebody to be married , even if it was two Dale Earnhardt Jr. fans .\" We had to accelerate it a little bit , \" Bobby Dezarov said as he and Crystal waited in the vestibule of the Chapel of the Bells at 2233 Las Vegas Boulevard South for the groomsman with the heavy right foot to arrive .Accelerate certainly was a great choice of word because the speedway folks got Kyle Busch to the church on time , and then everybody went into the little chapel lickity - split , and then Pastor Joseph W. Bird was standing front and center in it , ready to roll .Kyle Busch was standing up there , too , to the pastor 's left .I heard the pastor tell the groomsman with the heavy right foot that he had grown up in the Carolinas and that he had watched Bobby Isaac tear around the dirt tracks down there .Then the Celine Dion music started to play because it ca n't be an official wedding without Celine Dion music , regardless of how many NASCAR drivers are part of it .There must have been 20 witnesses .About 17 had cameras .One was wearing a bowling - type shirt that said \" Lucky 's Speed Shop \" on back .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.371155"}
