Kennedy Jr. for Kennedy 's role in stopping fracking in New York State , with Kennedy calling his ex - brother - in - law Governor Andrew Cuomo to stop fracking in its tracks .Meanwhile , as Trump told this writer , just over the New York border in Pennsylvania fracking is hitting its stride - in part because Trump believes the gas taken is coming from underneath the New York border , leaving New York the poorer at Cuomo 's hands .In today 's world , Trump is well on record as a Reagan fan , disdainful of those perceived by conservatives as Rockefeller 's political heirs .He is not a fan of George W. Bush .Which leaves open the question .Does Donald Trump want to be Governor of New York ?Could he be elected ?Yes , he could .By all accounts , 2014 is slated to be a GOP year .The Obama administration is plummeting by the day .Andrew Cuomo has not shown himself to be an overpoweringly popular governor .The one poll cited in Peyser 's column as Trump far behind - just as Rockefeller was once thought to be unelectable .And not to be forgotten , Trump 's battle with Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ( or \" Shakedown Schneiderman \" as we call him here ) alleging corruption on the part of Schneiderman would be red meat in a Trump for Governor campaign .( Over the holidays , as reported by the Associated Press , Trump filed two charges of ethics breaches against Schneiderman , setting the table neatly for a corruption - in - Albany campaign . )But politics aside , the real question is what is in Donald Trump 's head ?Unlike Nelson Rockefeller , Trump built his fortune himself .Overcoming every considerable challenge along the way .At this point , only Donald Trump can say whether he still gets up in the morning with the fire in the belly to build new resorts , golf courses , hotels , palaces , and towers .At 67 , it may well be that he really is looking for a new challenge - and as with Nelson Rockefeller in 1958 - after a life of considerable accomplishment has decided to finally take the serious political plunge .Had Mitt Romney won the presidential election last year , certainly Trump this minute might have been Secretary of the Treasury .He is scheduled next month to make a trip to New Hampshire , re - launching the presidential talk .The hard political fact of American life is that no one has been elected president without first holding political or military office - governor , general , senator , or congressman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.811035"}

{"text": "WASHINGTON , DC ( Catholic Online ) - September 12 , 2010 marked the fiftieth anniversary of one of the defining political speeches of the last 100 years .It was the address given by Senator John F. Kennedy to the Houston Ministerial alliance .In that speech he unleashed a horrid mistake .He laid out an approach to the role of religious faith which resulted in \" privatizing \" the truths informed by faith .He failed to acknowledge the existence of a Natural Law which can be known by all men and women through the exercise of reason and which is meant to govern our life together in Society .All just positive laws must comport with that Natural Law .In the wake of his catastrophic mistake too many Catholics in public life , like Esau of the Old Testament , sold their birthrights for a bowl of porridge and helped to construct the current culture of death .Many Catholics who hold public office in the United States have hidden behind the \" Kennedy Mistake \" .Former Senator Rick Santorum is different .In anticipation of this anniversary , he gave an extraordinary speech in Houston on Thursday , September 9 , 2010 entitled \" Charge to Revive the Role of Faith in the Public Square \" .He exposed the Kennedy Mistake and offered another model for Catholic political participation .We received permission to reprint it in full .( Go Here )Though it is somewhat longer than most articles published by Catholic Online , I encourage our readers to take the time to read it in its entirety .The upcoming elections in the United States of America are extremely important and so is this speech .We are living under what Pope Benedict XVI called a \" Dictatorship of Relativism \" in the West .The culture stumbles , drunken on the false notion of freedom as giving some people a \" right \" to kill the innocent , divorced from norms to guide the exercise of human choice and govern our behavior .When there is a wholesale effort to deny the existence of anything objectively true which can be known by all and form the basis of our common life , then there is no real freedom .Instead , we teeter on the brink of anarchy .Senator Santorum 's speech is a breath of fresh air .In an age of political sound bites and jingoism , he offers intelligent and impassioned reflection .This is a statesman .I identified with his introductory remarks , \" Three pictures hung in the home of my devoutly Catholic immigrant grandparents when I was a boy and I remember them well -- Jesus , Pope Paul VI and John F. Kennedy .The president was a source of great pride and a symbol to Catholics that all barriers had finally been broken .\" I grew up in Dorchester , Massachusetts and we had the same three pictures in our home .I vividly remember the fateful day when President Kennedy was assassinated .I was traumatized .I kept a scrapbook in which I collected newspaper articles , and photos concerning it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.59018"}

Ted Cruz ( R - Tex . ) is not a natural - born citizen and therefore is not eligible to be president or vice president of the United States .\" How did this all start ?With the ultimate target of Republican hatred - Barack Obama .Ever since Obama became a Presidential candidate in 2008 , Republicans have accused him of being ineligible to hold office .Without a political scandal ( such as Bill Clinton 's affair with Monica Lewinsky ) to fasten on , the Republican party opted for slander : Obama was born in Kenya - not Honolulu - and thus was not an American citizen .From this there could be only one conclusion : He would be an illegitimate President , and should be removed from office if elected .And this smear campaign continued after he won the 2008 election .Right - wingers like Trump insisted that Obama \" prove \" his citizenship fitness to hold office .During his first two years in office , Obama tried to ignore the charge .But polls repeatedly showed that large segments of the country believed it .Finally , even Obama 's closest advisers warned him : You must address this and put it to rest .So , on April 27 , 2011 , the President released the long - form version of his Hawaii birth certificate .Think of George W.
