{"text": "Senator Obama does n't want revotes in either Michigan or Florida , because he is afraid that he will lose in both states and risk the nomination .Just another example of Obama 's dishonesty relative to what he has said his campaign is based upon .He is nothing more than an ambitious politician calling everyone else ambitious politicians and portraying himself as someone that will change all of that .Based on his campaign , he wo n't change anything -- he 'll talk about it if he thinks it will get him elected , but actually do it -- no way .I see that svreader is growing more psychotic with each passing day .I think she will have a complete breakdown when it finally becomes apparent to her that Clinton has lost the nomination .She does have an amazing capacity to delude herself and lie about others , however .Obama is still has an insurmoutable lead in elected delegates .Hillary 's only hope is the superdelegates .Not likely there are enough of them to help her at this point .One other possibility being rumored is that Gore may come out of \" retirement \" if the Wright issue continues to grow and seriously hurt Obama 's chances in the general .The deal would be Obama would cede his delegates to Gore and Obama would get VP .Might work .This idea that rules only count for other people is a trademark of the Clintons .Look at the pardon of Marc Rich , the lying under oath , Travelgate , etc . .Its tiresome , really .Most of us learn about rules early on , and realize that if we 're part of an organization and we do n't like its rules , we leave the organization , or we try to change the rules within the proper process .The idea that you can change the rules on your whim , or manipulate them , to benefit yourself , is simply sociopathic .Hillary could have structured her campaign so that she would n't be in this situation now .She and her advisors were outsmarted by a bunch of novices .It must be very hard for them to take responsibility for their own screwup .Actually Barack has survived quite well considering the idiotic non - stop playing of the Wright video on every media outlet .The bog daily tracking polls , Rasmussen and Gallup , both showed a slight uptick overnight .Also from Fox News ( of all places ) , the first major poll taken since Barack Obama 's big speech on race relations , shows that the effect of the Jeremiah Wright flap might not be so bad after all .By a 57%-24 % margin , registered votes do not believe that Obama shares Wright 's controversial views .Fox also asked respondents whether they had doubts about Obama because of his association with Wright .The results : 35 % Yes , 54 % No , with the numbers standing at 26%-66 % for Democrats , 27%-61 % among independents , and 56%-33 % with Republicans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.274147"}

Clinton declined an interview with the New York Times to discuss gender and the presidential race .She chooses to ignore the topic throughout the campaign ... then lambasts the media for their sexist and mysognistic ways ... and then finally claims she 's IMPERVIOUS to the insults .The general concensus of three dictionaries is that the word means : NOT CAPABLE OF BEING AFFECTED OR DISTURBED .Clearly , the senator is both affected AND disturbed ... by the comments and , sadly , in general .I decided it was best to just ignore the comments related to a LACK OF RACISM in the campaign .How does one comment on this after the senator 's comments about her own supporters being white and hard - working .The same people who spew hatred and animosity when anyone dares breathe the word \" Clinton \" will swear that Obama lost ( in November ) because of racism .This is my prediction ! !However , Obama will lose because only the young ( young people had a greater opportunity for higher education than older people ) and the black have been bamboozled by Obama 's pretty words .Its a little late for this \" ism \" Hillary .Would this be a card that you would be playing if you were President ? ? ?How about some of the foriegn countries and leaders that you would be dealing with ? ? ?Would the Saudi 's and Muslims be exposed to your sexism issues because of their cultures ? ? ?You should have thought about all of this BEFORE you made the committment to run .I do not recall Rice or Albright complaining of sexism ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?This is the final straw .The fact Hillary is a women has absolutley nothing to do wirth why she has lost this nomination .She lost it because of some of Bill Clintons remarks and some of her pandering remarks and negative attacks .Hillary should just look in the mirror .Well somebody should tell Mrs Clinton if she believe only sexism plays a part in this Democratic presidential race she do n't know what time it is .Racism playes a bigger role in this presidential race .when 92 % of European American in west Virginia vote for mrs .Clinton race is a factor .Wow .I have been saying this from day one .Americans seem to accept sexism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.76893"}

{"text": "So what I 'm saying is , a massive effort was already made to organize African - American voters in 2004 : a 40 % increase in participation that made black voters over - represented in precisely those states you might hope Obama could now win .So let 's be honest : how much better can Obama do among African - Americans ?At most , Obama could squeeze out another two million votes nationwide ...Yet surely he will lose at least that much to racism in precisely those states where the African - American vote is most vital .More likely , Obama can win back Iowa and Missouri , then take the New Mexico , Colorado , and maybe Nevada .That is the better bet .I think the main thrust of my post still holds .Sexism helped Hillary and Racism 's effect on Obama 's campaign was complex and regionally varied .RCP has Obama currently winning in several Central and Moutain Time Zone states that voted for Bush in 2004 ( and even in both 2000 and 2004 ) : Iowa , Colorado , New Mexico , and Missouri ( barely ) .Obama 's also leading McCain in the latest poll in Virginia and on average is within 2 % of McCain in that state .A friend of mine who does research on race and representation in the US told me recently that studies have shown that racist voting among white voters goes down sharply after those voters have been represented by minority officials .For example , white voters in cities that have had Black mayors are less likely to vote against black candidates in the future .Something to consider here .Ohio will likely go the direction Columbus sets in 2008 .Columbus is overwhelmingly white and disproportionately educated .It also currently has a Black mayor .I do not think misogyny caused Hillary to lose .And Obama can win white , working - class voters .I guess my point is : he really needs to .He just can not squeeze much more out of the African - American voting bloc than the Democrats got in 2004 .I feel very optimistic about Obama 's chances .My big fear is that another terrorist attack will interrupt the campaign and frighten voters .If that happens , McCain will play the old hardline card , telling cheering audiences that we will hit them with everything we 've got .Will Obama be able to do the same ?I do n't believe the African - American vote is tapped out .Although it has been rising , it is still generally true that African - American voter turnout is lower than white voter turnout .What happened in the special elections in LA and MS show what can happen even in the South when African - Americans vote in numbers similar to white Americans .The figures Dr .

{"text": "In Wisconsin , a largely white state , the race issue seems to have been a wash for Obama .It worked similarly to the gender issue for Hillary - albeit a little bit more negatively for Obama than gender was for Hillary .So in Wisconsin the cynical view that American voters are bunch of sexists and racists does n't seem to hold much water .But what about West Virginia ?Interestingly , the West Virginia poll reports gender in more detail . 8 % of voters in WVA were men who said gender was important .Among them , 64 % voted FOR Hillary .21 % of WVA voters were Whites who said race was important to them .84 % of them voted AGAINST Obama .17.6 % of the vote went against Obama because of his race .I take two things from this .Sexism and racism vary greatly by region in this country .Second , with an \" n \" of two ( so huge caveats here ) and using CNN 's polls ( more caveats ) , it appears as if sexist voting was far more likely to help Clinton than hurt her even in states where she lost .Racist voting was more complicated .In Wisconsin ( a Midwestern swing state with very left wing pockets ) , it helped Obama .In West Virginia is was devastating .So the claims by die hard Clinton supporters that she lost because of misogyny are probably invalid .At the same time , the claims that Obama ca n't win White voters are also not necessarily valid .That said , it probably is the case that Obama 's race forces him to work from a different electoral map .He wo n't do well in places like West Virginia where the Clintons have a successful history .But he can compensate by doing better in the Midwest or in states with large numbers of heretofore untapped Black voters .10 comments : . \" [ Obama ] can compensate by doing better in ... states with large numbers of heretofore untapped Black voters . \"Which states are these ?The African - American vote is pretty highly tapped by the Democrats everywhere already .In 2004 , Kerry won 88 % of African - American vote .Record numbers of people voted in 2004 : 122 million voters , 60.7 % participation rate ( highest in 40 years ) .It is estimated that 14.6 million African - Americans voted in that election -- a record -- compared to 10.7 million on 2000 .That 's a 40 % jump in actual black voter participation .And by the way , that huge 2004 turnout represented a tremendous effort to organize the African - American vote in targeted areas .In Virginia , black voters increased from 16 % to 21 % of the electorate , while they only represented 18.4 % of the voting age population .In North Carolina , black voters increased from 19 % to 26 % of the electorate , while they only represented 20 % of the voting age population .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.24118"}
