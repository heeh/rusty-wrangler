{"text": "AL GORE !As Media Worries Over Trump , Hillary Clinton Ignored for Saying All Cops and Judges are Racists .-By Warner Todd Huston .As the media continues to lose its tiny collective , hive mind about every little utterance made by Donald Trump , Hillary Clinton has come out to proclaim that every cop and judge is a racist .Hillary Clinton went on criminal Al Sharpton 's radio show late last week and insisted that all cops are racist toward black men .She also said that the judicial system is inherently racist and ca n't properly judge blacks .During the conversation , Clinton told Sharpton , \" I believe we need to end the era of mass incarceration .She goes on to praise Obama 's task force on policing \" roadmap for reforms . \"So , Clinton just proclaimed all cops , all judges , all lawyers , the whole judicial system , to be a racist system inherently aligned against black people .Read more .If the Republican Party is stupid enough to hand Jeb Bush the nomination for the 2016 election for president , we will be stuck with another four years of a Democrat in the White House .ANY Democrat in the White House .Jeb ca n't win and he 'll lose the entire base of the party if he becomes the nominee .His nomination will also be the last straw for most conservatives .Bush foolishly imagines that he can overcome his disagreements with the conservative base .And his assumption might seem sensible in light of recent electoral history where the base has always dutifully fallen into line just ahead of the general election even after years of complaints .But I think that Bush misreads the level of dissatisfaction that conservatives have reached .At a recent appearance in Myrtle Beach , SC , Bush said that he thinks all the carping conservatives are doing about yet another Bush run for the White House will go away once the nomination is had and the general election is nigh .Read more .Hillary Sets New Legal Standard of ' Vast Majority ' To Excuse Breaking Law .-By Warner Todd Huston .Hillary Clinton said a lot of specious things during the Tuesday press conference where she was forced to answer to why she used a private email system instead of the proper government email when she was Secretary of State .But one thing she said was important because she essentially set a new legal standard of \" almost \" fulfilling the law and maintained that it excused her for violations .President Obama made dead sure that Hillary Clinton would never get caught using illegal private email systems while Secretary of State by refusing to appoint an official internal inspector general for the Dept . of State during Hillary 's tenure , a new report shows .It is the duty of the president to make sure that every government department has its own appointed Inspector General to serve as an internal watchdog over an agency .But during Hillary 's entire tenure , Obama never bothered to fill the vacant IG office for the State Department .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.72426"}

{"text": "The revised requirements announced Thursday pertain to changes in the Visa Waiver Program passed by Congress .Lawmakers had sought new restrictions to tighten up the program - which allows visa - free travel for residents of eligible countries - in order to prevent Europeans who have joined ISIS from entering the U.S. .The administration implemented the changes Thursday - but with some changes of its own .As called for by The Visa Waiver Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 , the administration is mostly excluding nationals of Iraq , Iran , Syria and Sudan as well as travelers who have visited the countries since Mar. 1 , 2011 from the program .Instead , they 'll have to apply for a visa in order to travel to the United States .But under the revised requirements , some Europeans who have traveled to those four countries in the last five years may still be allowed to travel to the United States without obtaining a visa if they meet certain criteria .Likely to cause ire among congressional Republicans is an additional waiver for people who have traveled to Iran \" for legitimate business - related purposes \" since the conclusion of the Iran nuclear deal in July .The administration also offers waivers for individuals who have traveled to Iraq for business as well .Citizens of 38 countries , mostly in Europe , are generally allowed to travel to the United States without applying for a visa .But they still have to submit biographical information to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization , or ESTA .The Homeland Security Department said waivers for some ESTA applicants will be granted on a \" case - by - case \" basis .Those travelers who are denied visa - free travel can still apply for visa through a U.S. embassy in their home country .Republicans reacted angrily to the waivers , saying the Obama administration had exploited the limited authority and has compromised national security .\" The Obama Administration is essentially rewriting the law by blowing wide open a small window of discretion that Congress gave it for law enforcement and national security reasons , \" Goodlatte said .The new restrictions had previously been criticized by the Iranian government that the U.S. is violating the nuclear deal by penalizing legitimate business travel to the country . . .Political correctness ( a.k.a . cultural Marxism ) is a poisonous ideology explicitly intended to degrade and destroy our culture .The only way to maintain it as the prevailing ideology is through thuggery .Unfortunately , most people are weak enough to submit to intellectual intimidation , rather than thinking for themselves .A former Department of Homeland Security agent says that an investigation he was conducting into a fundamentalist Islamic group operating in the U.S. may have helped stop San Bernardino jihadi Syed Farook had the government not shut down his probe .But Haney said that just a year into the investigation it was shut down State Department and the Homeland Security Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties .The reason the investigation was quashed ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.606995"}
