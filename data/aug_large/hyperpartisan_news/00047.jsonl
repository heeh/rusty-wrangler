'Snuff ' had a presence similar to ' Vermillion Pt.2 ' in Vol3 .Personally , ' Snuff ' did n't sound as emotional / dark as Vermillion Pt.2 and compared to the whole ' impression ' of the album , Snuff did n't really fit in to the picture .It is wierd .It is experimental in melodic sense .But it just simply ' doesnt't fit ' .On the ' experimental ' side , ( well , all the songs do tend to exploit both sides ) we have ' Butchers Hook ' .I sensed a bit of metalcore influence in this song .Dark , swinging riffs accompanied by Corey 's newly - enforced darker screams and of course , Joey Jordison full - on spine - breaking drumming .One of the best aspect of this new album was that many songs now featured solos ; it seems like a compensation for Mick and Jim being accused of lacking ' talent ' .Well , there you go doubters , you have extreme mind - boggling , yet , melodically fit ( which is to say , ear - pleasing ) solos that will rip your doubts to ribbons .In overview , the sound Slipknot have created on this new album is simply amazing .They have finally proven their capabillity to the full in my opinion .They now show us their talents more than ever , yet keeping the songs ear - pleasing and just purely enjoyable to listen to .Guitars , drums , vocals , turntables and keyboards were , in my opinion , to the full extent to virtualise the possibility of Slipnot 's limit to their limitless sound .Lyrics : Lyrics are usual stuffs .Indeed , they are dark .But Slipknot is nt really a band that require complex and metaphoric lyrics .All they needed was effect and the pure message conveyed in them .Although they need effects - only lyrics ( such as ' if you 're 555 then I 'm 666 or SICCCCC SICCC SICCCC ) , they still bring forth the absurdity and often what we 'd call ' insanity ' into the lyrics .Most notable would be lyrics in ' Psychosocial ' .You can read it and just realise how insane the lyrics actually feel .Reciting such lyrics casually as if you are saying it would cause a stir , would n't it ?Besides that , as I said , Slipknot blends in lyrics into a right rythm , maximising the effect of them , without them needing to be overly metaphoric .Corey Taylor has develped a darker way of screaming and his representation of his change in vocal style is consistent throughout the album .Even though Slipknot achieves their goal , their lyrics are tidious on their own .Overall Impression : As mentioned , some original Slipknot , metalcore influences and other sorts of metal influences is present in their new songs ( excluding melodic songs ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.25937"}

{"text": "Being that I work there , I got to hear the album in it 's entirety .Now , I 've been a fan of Slipknot for several years .When I was younger , they were a sort of gateway drug into metal for me , as I had no introduction to the genre at the time and knew nothing of how vast the whole genre really was .Even after discovering other bands in the metal world that are more technically and musically proficient , I have stuck by Slipknot 's music .Despite the fact that the songwriting is often simplistic and rhythm - oriented , I have had a definite appreciation for the way in which it was put together .The way each member ( or well , at least most of them ) contribute to the music puts together a sound that I still believe is entirely original .I even had a strong appreciation for Vol .3 when they toned down the aggression and focused more on the instrumentals .My first introduction to this album was with the single \" All Hope is Gone , \" which I quickly became addicted to .Good song , good instrumentals , a very catchy chorus , and a badass guitar solo .Joey Jordison still managed to drive the song home on the drums , and even Sid Wilson was still able to contribute his DJ skills .Once I heard this , I was more than stoked to hear what else they were planning on releasing .Then after that , I heard Psychosocial .This disappointed me a bit .The riffs were much more simplistic , and it seemed like Slipknot was definitely going much more in the direction of a more Stone Sour - ish type of sound .What upset me even more was the hardcore - esque breakdown in the middle of the song , which just seemed like at that point they were trying way too hard to match up to what 's popular in the metal scene right now .So I was sitting on the fence when the clock struck 7 to play the album in the store .I was sincerely hoping the band was going to put together something new and innovative that had some of the aggression of their self - titled album and Iowa along with the musical innovation of Vol .After the first few songs , I was already getting more and more disappointed .What I heard was not Slipknot , but very bad and very generic alternative rock .The tempos were all slowed down , the guitars doing very little musical innovation , a complete absence of Sid Wilson , and Joey Jordison doing a very steady and uninspired drum line .Corey Taylor was barely screaming and focused more on singing .Now , as I said , I am all for bands expanding and innovating .I am a huge fan of all of Metallica 's softer works up through the Black Album , but the major difference there is Metallica 's softer songs were innovative and original .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.52383"}

{"text": "Track 8 titled ' Gehenna ' is my least favorite of all the tracks on the CD .although getting back to a slipknot sound the chorus is a terrible attempt and when he tries to hit the high note I really just wanted to shut off the disk .It is in fact my least favorite Slipknot song off all 4 of their albums .Also it might be their longest track ever at just short of 7 minutes .

'You would think that the lyrical content of this song would be weird for a band like this but they have proven again they can make it work .Corey 's vocal talent is present throughout showing his range from singing to outright growls and screams but the vocal low point is ' Gehenna ' .It would n't have been so bad except when tries to hit the high note at the middle of the chorus .\" Free my severed heart .Give me you \" when he sings \" you \" he changes pitch and it is not something he should do .Overall Impression : Like I 've said 8 of the 12 tracks are really good and 4 are not to my liking at all .most of the time I do n't like it when an artist releases a short CD but I would have been happier if they only put those 8 on the disk .I really enjoy it overall but if you could nt tell I really do n't like StoneSour .If you really like both bands you will be pleased with this album .However if your on the fence and only like Slipknot 's heavier stuff Download ' Gemetria ( The Killing Name ) ' , ' Psychosocial ' , ' This Cold Black ' , and ' All Hope Is Gone ' .These are the standout tracks and definetly worth your time .All Hope Is Gone Reviewed by : SabbathFlames88 , on august 27 , 2008 1 of 3 people found this review helpful .Sound : Many are going to say this album is just another Vol . 3 , but those people probably only listened to a few songs and labeled SlipKnot as sellouts .Just because a band has a CD where not every song is cranked up to eleven does n't make them soft .\" Snuff \" will get the most negative feedback even though one of the best things about SlipKnot is they can be calm one second and rip your face off the next .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.49786"}

{"text": "Slipknot on the other hand still gets a lot of attention and All Hope Is Lost got reasonable coverage and praise .The problem here is that I ca n't get behind the argument that either praise , media attention , continued fan support is measurement for anything like music quality of a band .If you ask me both bands have watered down with their latest releases .You have n't read anything about latest Shadows Fall albums ?Slipknot is and will always be more of a popular and heated topic because the band was one of the icons of the Nu Metal movement which saw huge popularity and as icon Slipknot became the easy target for detractors of that subgenre .Shadows Fall has pretty much gone under the radar from any hate and their success was n't anything to compare with Slipknot 's if my memory does n't fail me , speaking about album sales that is .When Shadows Fall came out people where very busy hammering Trivium as the Metalcore bastards to pay any attention to SF .They do n't suck , they still kick some heavy ass with music .The only problem with ' Knot is they 've downgraded their music and last album did reflect it .Otherwise , every metal fan somehwere deep down loves Slipknot for their sheer aggression and some heavy music .I really ca n't say about others but you can count me ' Knot fan though .I would think a lot of metalheads do n't identify at all with the particular brand of aggression in their music , which seems to me to be either hot - topic teen angst at times or sort of a somewhat offbeat type at other times .Or trying to be offbeat .I 'm not really an expert but they are one of those bands that does n't seem all too similar to many others out there .I used to love Slipknot back in the day as a teenager when the self - titled and the Iowa album hit big , but since then I 've kinda lost interest in them .Either cause their material after Iowa was worse , or because I grew up and my tastes changed .I have no idea .Would still like to hear their new album though , if just to hear what they 're sounding like now that Paul is dead and Joey has left .I still think Slipknot was one of the most groundbreaking bands in the beginning of the new millennium , and that their self - titled album is great , but after this I gradually lost a my interest in them .I do n't mind the sales , for me this band has lost almost all the freshness and intensity they surprised me with in the Slipknot album .Just a question of tastes , do n't forget it ... .I would think a lot of metalheads do n't identify at all with the particular brand of aggression in their music , which seems to me to be either hot - topic teen angst at times or sort of a somewhat offbeat type at other times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.74558"}

{"text": "Dead Memories ' is a big opposite to the first songs , the guitar riff reminds me a bit on ' wait and bleed'and it 's more like a metal ballad .Song 6 and 7 are typical power songs of Slipknot and two of the ' not so special ' songs , but they are still good . 'Gehenna ' is one of the psychedelic metal songs with a low speed and a cool guitar solo .Song 9 and 10 are simply hard fast metal songs with very clever guitar riffs and a very good corey on the vocals .As the musical way of Slipknot forecasted us there is finnaly a accoustic ballad with touching lyrics and a sad sound . 'Snuff ' is a very good song that is now often played in memory of Paul Gray(R.I.P ) .The last song of the album is the title song . 'All hope is gone ' is again one of the fast songs with a great double base of Joey and the hard fast gutar riff plus the sampling and a heavy chorus .There are 3 bonus songs on the special edition ' Child of burning time ' , ' Vermillion pt.2(Bloodstone Remix ) ' and ' Till'we die ' .All good songs which fitted into the attitude of All hope is gone .\" All Hope Is Gone \" has got very much good sites and just a few bad ones .The Sound quality is very good and is pretty awesome with 5.1 sound system .Lyrics : Like on the previous Cd 's Slipknot or mainly Corey Taylor are doing a great lyrics and singer job .As alyays most of the lyrics got an hidden sense and this time Corey sings with his growling and his melodic voice .Just some bad things are destroying the very good work .Example : All hope is gone ( the Song )In the chorus corey losts his voice a few time and you can hear his breathing too loud .Not a big thing but I 'm sure that he could have done it better during the first albums .Also in the song is the very short part when they are screaming ALL HOPE IS GONE .That really blew me away becouse of it 's power .What I liked , too .Are the lyrics of ' Snuff ' : So save your breath I will not hear I think I made it very clear You could n't hate enough to love Is that supposed to be enough ?He just gort a few lows , and he is still one of my favourite singers .Overall Impression : Finally an awesome album of an awesome band .Some people are saying that it is the worst album of Slipknot , and maybe it is , but it is still very good and powerfull .I can suggest this album to anyone who likes metal or similar music genres , and I 'm happy that I 've got it .I hope that my English was n't to bad to understand , and I still hope that there will be a new Slipknot album and that ' All hope is n't gone ' ; ) // 9 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.996185"}

'Corey Taylor 's voice has healed after it 's break while recording Vol . 3 and he is at his best !Corey Taylor is still the Baritone Voice .Overall Impression : This album is a lot better then some of the other metal albums to be released this year .If you have my taste in music I would say it is n't as good as Death Magnetic ( Metallica , ) it is way better then Shogun ( Trivium ) and Indestructible ( Disturbed . )The only thing I do n't like about this album is track one ( . execute . ) because it is just wierd noises probably done by Craig Jones / Sid Wilson .All Hope Is Gone Reviewed by : morello#2 , on january 05 , 2009 1 of 1 people found this review helpful .Sound : All hope is gone is slipknot 's new release and it is definitely a return to form .The drumming in particular is brilliant , so tight but still containing the aggression that made slipknot what it is .The guitar playing on this record is n't as good as other albums especially the solos and although Root and Thomsom introduced more shredding to this album , the guitars still lack something .All hope is Gone is definitely a change for slipknot but it is also a huge step forward for this band .You can also hear some of the elements of stone sour in this record and it goes to show that the time that some of the band members put into their side projects helped their development as musicians .it 's a vast improvement for taylor .Overall Impression : Overall this album is great , a definate must have for any metal fan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.298004"}

GUTIERREZ , FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER .Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor speaks to his fans during an appearance Monday night at House of Blues Anaheim .ANA P. GUTIERREZ , FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER .Local metal fans were treated to something extra special at House of Blues Anaheim on Monday night , as Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor kicked off his first - ever month - long solo acoustic tour at the Downtown Disney venue .Prior to the show Taylor hosted a special meet - and - greet soundcheck with several adoring fans , who shared stories beforehand of how the songwriter has had an impact on their lives .Teary - eyed , one young woman shared that she brought her boyfriend to the show ; at one point recently , he was so depressed he contemplated suicide by taking a handful of pills - but after hearing Stone Sour 's \" Bother , \" he decided otherwise .Before this solo debut , I met up with Taylor backstage , where he guzzled coffee and tried to calm his nerves .\" I am terrified , \" he admitted as we sat cozily on a small back couch in one of the dressing rooms .\" If I was n't so over - the - top , just bouncy and garrulous , I 'd probably be pooping my pants .I 'm ecstatic - ( these are ) two of my favorite things to do , run my mouth and play acoustic songs .I can do that all day .As long as everyone walks away going , ' Man , that was a blast , ' then I 've done my job .Taylor says hearing from early - bird fans about how much his music and memoir has meant to them is humbling .There 's nothing to describe it .When you start out in this business - unless you 're a total ( jerk ) - you have no pretense .You hope for the best , but you try to keep an even - keeled mind ; you do n't let the success blow you up and you do n't let the downfall bring you down .\" For me , everything I approach is like that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.74621"}
