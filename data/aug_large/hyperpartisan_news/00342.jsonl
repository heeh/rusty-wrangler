{"text": "Dear Mr. Steele .By : J.J. Jackson .For your convenience and mine I have reproduced the questions asked before providing my answers .Question : \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A recent national poll reported that nearly 25 % of Americans want the government to pass more socialist legislation .No true American would answer that they agree with this proposed course of action .Likewise no student of history who can clearly see the past and present horrors that socialist government in any of its many forms has suffered upon the people would answer in the affirmative unless they are so blinded by a lust for power for themselves and control over others .The problem however becomes that I must ask the question what has the Republican Party done to stop the slowly creeping hand of unconstitutional state control over the years ?What has made them a better keeper of American liberty ?Is it merely the fact that they have not been party to as much bad socialist legislation as other political parties ?If such is the case , and it surely is , then it is not whether or not I agree but whether or not the Republican Party agrees and is willing to act against members who promote such folly .The question should not be which creates more jobs but which creates more liberty and sustainable employment .Both systems have proven capable of creating jobs .But is it good policy to pay one man to dig a hole and then another to simply fill it back up so that it may be dug again as many government make work projects do ?Is it good policy to build buildings that will see little use and simply to spend money as government is want to do ?Is it good policy to enact legislation that kills one job for an American worker but creates two bureaucratic posts to oversee the remaining ones as government policy often does ?Of course it is not .The American Free Enterprise System naturally creates jobs and does so by allowing individuals to freely enter into contracts with one another for goods and services .It allows them to partake of their liberty and is obviously and by far a better system despite at times that liberty leading to pain and suffering due to people making bad business decisions .Of course I prefer the latter to the inevitable pain doled out by government bureaucrats .Question : \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Obama Administration has proposed spending as much as $ 1.5 trillion to bail out the banking industry .It is not just the Obama Administration that has proposed such .It has also been the Republican Party\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s representatives who have done such and actually helped pass bailouts of lenders who made bad financial decisions with their assets and acted poorly in their fiduciary responsibility to their customers who have invested with them .TARP is the glaring example of this .Of course such actions are extra - constitutional in scope and should not be undertaken .The problem is that neither major party has shown the ability to lead on such an issue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.481125"}

{"text": "The GOP must correct its own house and get its message straight before it can grow the party .Question : \" What can the Republican Party do to earn your trust ?Sadly this is not a simple answer .The Republican Party has so much to do that trust can not be given easily .The party has betrayed American and our first principles so many times that it becomes a massive task in and of itself to just reach a point of modest trust much less competent action .A recurring theme is that many members of the Party are far too liberal and do far too much harm to America with their actions upon being elected to office .These folks should not be members of the Party and while it may be untenable to sever ties with these individuals due to a fear of loss in power and numbers within the current House and Senate we see that they can not be trusted anyway .Other members of the Party , Senator John McCain for example , have introduced blatant legislation within the chambers of Congress that directly opposes the Constitution and attempts to circumvent it .I speak of course of McCain - Feingold .There is absolutely no excuse for any man or woman representing the GOP to even think for a second that such was anything less than an unconstitutional infringement upon our God given liberties .Yet he and many others are allowed to remain in the Party 's good graces .And I do not believe that I need to even point out the heinousness of TARP which was supported by many members of the Republican Party and yet another clearly unconstitutional overreach .Far be it from me to imply that there should not be disagreements between members of the Party over issues .But when the issues in question are so clearly in violation of the federal Constitution yet still supported by Party members a serious look must be taken to see if they are worthy of being called Republicans .If not they should be thanked for their service and sent on their way to run either as Democrats , Independents or with some other third party that would accept their actions .The Republican Party must correct this to gain the trust of Americans who still believe in liberty and the Party must be willing to part company with those that do not in fact hold our Constitution and the principles of limited government most dear .The example most clear to me is that of the 2004 Senatorial elections involving Mr. Arlen Specter .The Republican Party disregarded a clearly superior candidate in terms of Republican ideals in Mr. Pat Toomey to openly support the incumbent .And today he has repaid that effort how ?I believe you see my obvious point .To be frank Mr. Steele , I am not so certain that you are indeed the man who can help achieve the goal of regaining either my trust or the trust of many other Americans which the GOP so desperately needs .You have not yet earned my trust and while I will gladly give you the opportunity to do so I remain skeptical .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.90294"}

Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats and Stephen Douglas of the Northern Democrats .I apologize if I was ambiguous .It was a national party dominated by Southern constituents , Southern candidates , slavery apologists ( in the north ) and Southern policies .The party became very effective at threatening that the south would secede if the north failed to vote for it .Stephen A. Douglas , for instance , though certainly not pro - slavery , was terrified by the thought of a southern secession , and bent over backwards to convince northerners to stop criticizing the institution .Yes , the Democratic Party split geographically along north - south lines , but that was incidental .The real split was between extreme , hostile pro - slavery attitudes and mere slavery acceptable .By 1860 , it was not enough to merely allow slavery to continue to exist in the South .Natural demographic and economic forces were shrinking and reducing the institution , so the Southern Democrats wanted proactive support from northerners and the federal government in protecting slavery from such forces .Stephen A. Douglas was viewed as too passive on the slavery matter , and so he was rejected as leader ( though he had been nominated legitimately - the slave states were quick to reject democratic results they did not like ) and the party split .Excellent , but one quibble , the legality of secession was considerably more vague than you let on .A bunch of northern states considered in during the war of 1812 , and the SC tried it before , as you say , during the nullification crisis .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.43611"}

{"text": "Election Postmortem - The Point Everybody is Missing [ Reader Post ] .By now everybody knows about the results of Tuesday 's elections and we 've seen tons of analysis .Did I miss anything ?It 's natural to knee jerk or overreact when something unexpected happens , so I have advice for both sides : do n't read too much into this election and base your next moves only on what happened Tuesday .First , for the Democrats , you were n't given a mandate .You scored some impressive wins on Tuesday , and for that I congratulate you .You kept the presidency in a hard fought campaign .You managed to gain seats in the Senate , including one popular figure from your side in Elizabeth Warren retaking Ted Kennedy 's old seat in Massachusetts .You got a referendum passed in Colorado legalizing pot , you got gay marriage ballot initiatives through in three states , and in California several measures to raise taxes and restrict economic freedom also went through .Combine this with President Obama 's 333 electoral votes and it looks like you 've got a clear mandate that the country is shifting leftward , right ?Not quite .When you look at the battleground states the president 's victory only came by roughly 350,000 votes .Yes , I now what the final margin in the overall popular vote was certainly more decisive , but keep in mind that the president also got nine million fewer votes than in 2008 .The Republicans gained seats in the House , and now has it 's largest margin among Governorships that either party has had in 12 years .Your California measures only made an already hostile business climate even worse by raising taxes and assuring that the unions will still be able to force union members to pay for their political campaigning .Expect more businesses to leave your state and unemployment to rise even more .And be careful with the gay marriage wins - your side seems to be even more prone to overreach than the right is .I 'm predicting you 'll jump the shark on this issue when someone decides to file a lawsuit against a church that refuses to perform a gay marriage .Sadly you 'll succeed in turning public opinion on this issue better than any conservative ever could .Now for the conservatives .Yes , the Romney campaign was not perfect .I 'm not even going to bother linking to any of the myriad of post game analysis articles on what went wrong .If you 're reading this post you 've probably read more than your share already .The day was n't a complete disaster for the GOP , as seen by my earlier mention of the House and Governorships .Of course , the presidency was the big prize and the failure to defeat such an incompetent president is painful to say the least .While I 've seen no shortage of reasons for Romney 's loss to Obama , nobody has seen the most obvious reason that Romney failed - there is simply no way he could have beaten Obama .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.67806"}

{"text": "Tom : The kind words are appreciated .However , I do n't think Lieberman 's attempt to critique the Democratic party is a case of too little , too late .He could have launched his counteroffensive on Dean sooner , but at least he never threw in the towel and repositioned himself as a prodigal dove , as Kerry and Gephardt have .Besides , I 've long believed Lieberman 's best chance to be taken seriously by his party is if it suffers a solid unambiguous electoral drubbing in 2004 .2004 has always been a long shot for Lieberman .2008 , however , is a distinct possibility .I remember the criticism of Clinton on Serbia , too .It was n't grounded in Clinton 's venality , it was a national interest based argument .And I certainly do n't remember it being more strident than the current criticism .I do recall Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott making the case that whatever the criticism prior , once the US was committed , we were committed .It was the Republican leadership saying partisanship stopped at the water 's edge .I have a story on my own blog about meeting Strom Thurmond and him saying that Clinton had no business sending our boys to fight for Kosovo .But that is a far cry from \" he 's a neocon bent on taking over the world .\" It seems like a rather selective memory to think that during and after the war over Serbia that Republicans were grandstanding and calling the President a liar and a reckless unilateralist , despite the lack of a Congressional authorization , much less a UN one .Yes , before the bombing started they said he should have sought Congressional authorization .But when the bombs started falling , the deed was done .There was no ex post facto carping about it .The problem still comes down to the Left not being sincere about defense .Just being willing to use the military is not a sign that you are serious about national security .Bill Clinton had more military expeditions than his predecessors , but none represented \" national security \" requirements .Somalia ( I know inherited from Bush , but he changed the mission ) , Haiti , the various adventures in the former Yugoslavia , multiple engagements with Iraq - none were predicated on making Americans safer .Well , that 's not true .The few that were turned out to be woefully ineffective .Oh , and he also does n't hate George Bush enough .I do n't have any good answers ffor the Democrats , other than to wait until after the end of the war on terror , and people wo n't care as much about the issue .It worked for Bill Clinton .SamAm , your points are well taken .That was a shameful episode , and the fact that it was made in the face of a much less serious threat may explain its lack of political resonance but not absolve its moral taint .Let 's hope the Republicans have learned a few things as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.0461"}

{"text": "Absent this shakedown of potential car buyers , Tesla would have lost $ 57 million , or $ 11,400 per car .As the company sold 5,000 cars in the quarter , though , $ 13,600 per car was paid by other manufacturers , who are going to pass at least some of that cost on to buyers of their products .Folks in the new car market are likely paying a bit more than simply the direct tax subsidy .Slate 's Scott Woolley details another way in which Tesla has cost taxpayers money .In 2009 , Tesla received a $ 465 million Department of Energy loan that allowed it to weather a financial maelstrom .Unlike Solyndra ( and Abound Solar and Fisker Automotive and The Vehicle Production Group LLC ) , Tesla managed to repay the loan in 2013 .But Tesla paid the U.S. taxpayers back at a rate far below what venture capitalists would have earned on the same loan .As an example , Tesla 's CEO Elon Musk also made a loan to Tesla .Musk got a 10 % interest rate and options to convert the debt to stock , which he did , resulting in a 3,500 % rate of return on his investment .In contrast , the U.S. taxpayer received a 2.6 % rate of return .In other words , in our crony capitalist system , taxpayers take the loss on bad loans like the one to Solyndra , but do not enjoy commensurate reward on good loans like the one to Tesla .But there is still more .Tesla can not keep earning emissions credits , which allow it to earn a profit despite selling its cars at a loss , unless it can keep selling those cars .Josh Harkinson , writing for Mother Jones , writes that : .Its first - quarter profit , a modest $ 11 million , hinged on the $ 68 million it earned selling clean - air credits under a California program that requires automakers to either produce a given number of zero - emission vehicles or satisfy the mandate in some other way .Tesla 's ability to continue selling the cars that earn the credits is in question .The market for $ 80,000 cars has a limited number of buyers .Tesla must expand its customer base with a more affordable product .One way to achieve that would be to cut the vehicle 's range .But subsidies , credits and fuel savings notwithstanding , consumers have little taste for lower ranges - even at a much lower price .Another way for Tesla to lower the cost of its vehicles is to cut the cost of its batteries without sacrificing the range .As Harkinson observes : .That , however , may again depend on massive subsidies - in this case funding to battery researchers and manufacturers by the governments of Japan and China .Over the past five years , Japan 's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization , a public - private partnership founded in 1980 , has pumped roughly $ 400 million into developing advanced battery technologies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.235504"}
