{"text": "Of course , they have a history with that song as do many of us who lived during the turbulent 60s .Even today , listening to it stirs deep , sometimes unnamed emotions in me like very few songs .The origin of the song is disputed .For many years the root of the song was attributed to Charles Albert Tindley 's gospel song I 'll Overcome Someday , first published in 1901 .Tindley was a well - known pastor in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and wrote over forty other published gospel songs .He is best remembered for his very quotable lyrics such as these from I 'll Overcome Someday : .The world is one great battlefield With forces all arrayed .If in my heart I do not yield , I 'll overcome some day .If you accept this starting point , then there is evidence that the song - or a version of it became popular quite early among labor union workers , but disappeared from the gospel world .Other strong evidence points to Louise Shropshire 's gospel hymn If My Jesus Wills as the original version .She was an African American Baptist choir director who apparently knew personally some key African American artists in the civil rights movement .The simplicity of both the lyrics and the melody - as well as the emotional context that continues to make it a song of protest and of hope - certainly come down to us today from the protest singers of the late 50s and early 60s .But if you associate the song with any one historical figure from that time , you probably have never forgotten how Martin Luther King used the hymn to encourage and rally those who would stand up with him .On Sunday , March 31 , 1968 , just hours before his assassination , King quoted the lyrics of We Shall Overcome in his final sermon in Memphis .His words from his famous sermon delivered at Temple Israel in Hollywood , California , will give you the sense of how he used these words : .We shall overcome .We shall overcome .Deep in my heart I do believe we shall overcome .And I believe it because somehow the arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends towards justice .We shall overcome because Carlyle is right ; \" no lie can live forever \" .We shall overcome because William Cullen Bryant is right ; \" truth crushed to earth will rise again \" .We shall overcome because James Russell Lowell is right : .Truth forever on the scaffold , Wrong forever on the throne .Yet that scaffold sways the future , And behind the then unknown Standeth God within the shadow , Keeping watch above his own .With this faith , we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope .With this faith , we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood .With this faith , we will be able to speed up the day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.46626"}
