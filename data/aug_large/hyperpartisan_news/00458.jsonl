S. capabilities .\" Collection of information regarding the air , water , and soils is a classic foreign intelligence practice because analysis of these samples can result in the identification of military operations and capabilities , \" Widnall stated .This led to an entire tourist industry around Area-51 centered on people hiking up into the mountains surrounding the base where they could look down over into the valley towards the flight test center at Groom Lake , and see what was flying around .We will not know for sure who ordered the investigation because Clinton records are not subject to FOIA requests until January 2006 .What is known , is that Air Force Secretary Widnall knew the White House wanted a report on Roswell , and she was writing to Gibbons to report what had been done .Her words appeared at first glance to be very encouraging , .\" I intended to bring it over this morning , but forgot .My policy is that we are declassifying everything even remotely related , and anything our people think still needs to be classified will have to be justified to me .More to follow !On the bottom of the memo Gibbons wrote a note for his primary Roswell expert in the Office , Skip Johns , suggesting they sit down and discuss the report prior to talking to Rockefeller .\" Skip for your scanning .\" Gibbons wrote .JG \" .On May 26 , 1994 Scott Jones wrote another letter to Gibbons to ask if \" there had been enough progress with your look into the Roswell incident to warrant another meeting with Laurance . \"In addition , Jones stated he was writing to update Gibbons on the latest news .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.25758"}

{"text": "The Subject is as Important as any We Will .Ever Face .This Information Belongs to the World .Although some around President Clinton seemed determined to exclude UFOs from the presidential list of \" things to do , \" Clinton himself , had always exhibited a strong interest in the subject of UFOs .In many of his public speeches he mentioned UFOs or joked about them .One example was when he commented quite positively over the 1996 alien invasion movie \" Independence Day . \" The movie had been screened for Bill and Hillary Clinton in the White House on July 6 by Bill Pullman who played the president in the movie , along with director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin .Not only did he talk openly about the movie with reporter Tom Brokaw , he even found a moral in the fictional alien story of aliens attacking the earth .That moral Clinton attached to his comment was exactly the same one former President Reagan had attached to his alien invasion comments made between 1985 and 1987 .\" I loved it .I loved it and --Mr .Pullman came and showed it .I thought he made a good president .And we watched the movie together , and I told him after it was over he was a good president , and I was glad we won .And it made me wonder if I should take flying lessons .The good thing about Independence Day is there 's an ultimate lesson for that -- for the problems right here on Earth .We whipped that problem by working together with all these countries .And all of a sudden the differences we had with them seemed so small once we realized there were threats that went beyond our borders .And I wish that we could think about that when we deal with terrorism and when we deal with weapons proliferation -- the difference between all these others problems .That 's the lesson I wish people would take away from Independence Day .\" It was a matter of action and policy which Clinton loved , even on holidays .Holidays were things that Clinton hated .Vacation represented inaction and being cut off from the people .Nothing , however , was put out by the White House Press Office which indicated UFOs were on the vacation agenda .This was undoubtedly because it was not an item high in the polls , and the possible damage that might occur by announcing the meeting could not be justified by the few votes that might be gained .The press did not make any mention of the UFO briefing , perhaps because they were sidetracked by another story that had run in the local paper .Rumors circulated among the reporters , the day after Clinton arrived at the Rockefeller Ranch , that Barbra Streisand was in Jackson Hole , and might have had supper with the President .Such as story was an addictive high for reporters .When she returned home , Hillary had reportedly banned Streisand from the White House when she was out of town .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.415665"}

B. Scott Jones , who had been involved with Rockefeller in the first UFO briefing given to a member of the Clinton administration , was not too certain that the White House would ever let the briefing take place .On August 23 , 1995 , he wrote to Jack Gibbons trying to find out what had happened . \"Mr. Rockefeller was a guest at the President\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s birthday party a few days ago in Jackson Hole , Wyoming .I hope he had an opportunity to talk to the President about this subject .It would be comforting to know for sure that the President is not being shielded by the White House staff on this subject . \"As Dr. Greer had been providing material for the briefing , and was corresponding with Dorskind at the White House , this author asked Greer at the 2000 Spring Laughlin World UFO Congress what the President\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s reaction had been to the Rockefeller presentation .Greer stated . \"Bill Clinton\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s reaction was that he had asked Webster Hubbell to look into this .Webster Hubbell asked NORAD , and asked if there was anything to it .They said no ... Clinton was not in put into the loop contrary to what you might have heard on this , and Carter was largely left out .He knew a little , but he was not allowed to really get briefed .Reagan knew more , and Bush knew more .He said that the Clintons had not commented on the information until the next morning , when , before the President appeared , Mrs. Clinton requested to Mr. Rockefeller that he not bring the subject up again .It should be noted that no matter what happened regarding UFOs at the JY Ranch - it was not a \" briefing \" in the classic government sense .An official briefing is never done on a one - on - one basis .A briefing is a concise review of a subject for an official by someone who is an government expert in the field - not a civilian .This technical point also holds true for the Greer - Woosley encounter in December 1993 which was also described by many accounts as a briefing .In addition to Hillary being included in the Rockefeller briefing given to Bill Clinton during the 1995 vacation , the Clinton OSTP files give another hint at the key involvement by Hillary in the Rockefeller UFO Initiative .As mentioned before , for a period of three years Rockefeller worked on a letter to be sent to the President on the UFO subject .Although not explicitly stated in the OSTP files , it appeared that Rockefeller had been discouraged from sending the letter to the President it by Jack Gibbons .On November 1 , 1995 , Rockefeller\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s lawyer Henry L.

The X - Conference is a unique event which focuses on the political , governmental and social aspects relating to extraterrestrial - related phenomena .It is produced by PRG as part of the ongoing activist movement seeking to end the truth embargo .Approximately 28 lecturers and panelists will present .New for this year : .James Deardorff , PhD is a prolific researcher of extraordinary range who embodies the legacy of James E. McDonald .He began his studies at Reed College in Portland , Oregon in 1946 - 47 and then switched to Stanford University , where he majored in physics earning his bachelor of science in 1950 .He attended UCLA receiving a second bachelor of science in meteorology in 1951 .After a 4-year stint in the Navy Dr. Deardorff went on to achieve an MS ( 1956 ) and PhD ( 1959 ) in Meteorology .After postgraduate work he took a position at the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , CO , in 1962 .There he migrated into the study of laboratory and numerical modeling of turbulent thermal convection , and boundary - layer turbulence and diffusion .After a few years at NCAR he became a senior scientist , enjoying a successful , 16-year research career .A list of the published research papers during this career is provided in an expanded curriculum vitae .After NCAR Jim took a position at Oregon State University in 1978 as a research professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences .It was in Oregon that Dr. Deardorff became interested in extraterrestrial - related phenomenon and by the late 1970s had decided the evidence pointed conclusively towards the ETH .By 1985 his research interests had irrevocably turned to the ETH and its implications for society , and around this time he had the first of five sightings .So in 1986 he took early retirement from OSU .Writing papers and research grant proposals and attending to associated administrative duties no longer seemed as important as exploring extraterrestrial - related phenomenon and trying to raise public awareness .By 1987 he had written three peer - reviewed papers dealing with this new area of interest : David Sereda is a social and environmental activist with a broad range of interests .As with many others , his interest in extraterrestrial - related phenomena was sparked in 1968 by a strong sighting of a large , classic disc - shaped object hovering in a clear sky with hundreds of witnesses shouting with excitement and pointing upwards in amazement .After 20 minutes of watching this object , David saw it disappear .This event created a life - long interest in extraterrestrial - related phenomena which combined with interests in space , religion , philosophy , astronomy and science and led to a multifaceted career in high technology , environmental and humanitarian issues and professional photography .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.193214"}

Gersten had submitted numerous affidavits from witnesses who had observed massive , black , triangular shape craft with extraordinary flight characteristics .But the DoD continued to maintain in court it could find no information confirming the existence of such objects .Gersten was seeking an additional 90 days of discovery and an opportunity to depose DoD personnel .During the 30 minute hearing Gersten argued the government 's search for relevant information lacked the necessary element of \" good faith .\" Apparently the Judge agreed .A written opinion would be issued within 30 days .Now the Judge has asked the DoD to provide additional affidavits expanding on the methods used by the DoD to service the FOIA request .These will be reviewed in support of the forthcoming ruling for dismissal or further discovery .CAUS is one of many groups applying pressure for full disclosure by the U. S. government as to the facts regarding UFO / ET phenomena .February 4 , 2000 Press Release .CAUS remains at the forefront of the legal wing of the disclosure movement to require the U. S. government to be forthright regarding all it knows about UFO / Extraterrestrial related phenomena .On Monday , February 7 , Gersten will again step into the courtroom to make oral arguments in a new case , CAUS vs. Department of Defense ( DOD ) .This case seeks to learn what the DOD knows about large triangle shaped craft seen repeatedly within the United States and elsewhere .These craft are reported to be larger than a football field and capable of hovering in complete silence .In Phoenix , Arizona , U. S. District Court Judge Stephen M. McNamee denied DOD motions to dismiss , thus setting the stage for a rare opportunity to submit oral arguments on behalf of the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit .Gersten has submitted affidavits from witnesses who have observed these unusual , black , triangle shaped objects .The Department of Defense has maintained it could find no information confirming the existence of such craft .CAUS also is engaged in another lawsuit , CAUS v.
