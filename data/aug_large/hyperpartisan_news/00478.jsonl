{"text": "I am shocked that any rescue doing puppy mill rescue would recommend putting an ex puppy mill dog into a no - dog household though or that they thought this would benefit a very shy one :( .They are setting up these poor dogs for further discomfort and new owners for the situation you have found yourself in -- with a dog that is scared and shy and confusing for you to know how to manage .This is absolutely not a criticism of where you find yourself --just the opposite -- it is just totally irresponsible of the rescue ! ! !: eek : .I am so glad you were able to see how reassuring and positive it is for her to be around another dog .You are far more likely to get a better adjusted trusting dog , if Muppet has another confident dog to take cues from .If it is impossible to do this the chance of her remaining like she is are higher if she is left as a solo dog .Any friend is better than no canine friend but it isn;t easy either to take in another unknown quantity .From that angle it is hard to know what to suggest except to keep working with her as you are and using some of the advice above .: flwr : Getting her to mix with another dog such as your parents ' as frequently as possible will always help and I 'd try to do that .I don;t know if a play date with a dog is really the right approach -- more just having a quiet day or half day with someone else 's dog . 'Play ' is not something these dogs tend to understand for a long long time and she needs an example around the house such a your parents ' dog , not just a dog interaction though even just meeting some other dogs will be good for her .It is notable that all the people who replied to you with some positive stories had at least one and sometimes several other dogs at home alongside their mill rescue .Rescues really have to be so well informed and responsible if they are rehoming mill dogs .Mill dogs can also be the most rewarding but owners need to search deep to explore if this is the right type of dog I think and be honest if they can make that long term commitment to an emotionally distant dog that may not change .On the other hand the little breakthroughs can be marvellous and some eventually end up a totally different dog to what they arrived as .: flwr : .Have you tried discussing her fear with your vet ?Just like people , animals can have post traumatic stress disorder , depression , and anxiety .I know first hand because my Ragdoll Solo actually was diagnosed with anxiety after trying to figure out why for the first 7 months of his life he would meow at nothing , and constantly .Meds helped him out a lot and he was only on them for about 4 or 5 months until weaned off , and he is a changed cat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.70785"}

'We researched raw feeding , reading about the BARF model ( Biologically Appropriate Raw Food ) and the Prey Model .BARF includes vegetables and fruits and the Prey Model does not .We went with the Prey Model .However ... .It turns out that feeding a dog raw animal matter is n't cheap .We figured we were spending about $ 2.50 a day or $ 75 a month on food for her when she was eating kibble and eggs / meat / bones .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.967964"}
{"text": "The other way forward is possible if your girl likes her food .Sometimes Cavalier greed can work in their favour !This worked very well with one of my Cavaliers who was not a rescue but for various reasons had not been socialised .Gradually they realise that people can be a source of treats and greed overcomes fear !When I first had Aled he hated being picked up - endured it but froze - I think because he had always been picked up roughly , had something nasty done to him ( tangled fur combed or nails clipped ) and then been dumped down again .Now , if Oliver is on my lap Aled wants to come up too and share the fuss .And some Cavaliers ( like both my two ) are never interested in playing with toys .But she will need to be much more confident before she is ready to walk in the big world !Again , another Cavalier to walk with her could help .You will need a lot of patience .Aled is younger than your girl , less damaged and not so fearful , but even with Oliver 's help he did n't really start coming out of his shell for a year , and on his own he is still not very confident .But the plus side is that Cavaliers are amazingly resilient , and hopefully your girl will slowly respond to love and start relaxing .Well done for taking her on !but I have to have hope that at some time in the future she may want affection / cuddles / walks / etc .I hope her past has n't completely stunted the possibility and that there is a chance for her to enjoy / be a part of life and create a bond with me at some time .Any advice would be much appreciated !I have not had a rescue dog but there are others on this forum that have , & they will give you good advice .I just want to say that it seems to me there is already a bond , almost unnoticed by you , but I would think very significant to this damaged little dog who \" wo n't let anyone else other than me hold her \" .You will be her only place of safety .I know it seems to you that you have made little progress but it actually appears that you have achieved a great deal in a very short time .To toilet train a five year old bitch , who has never been in a house , in just 4 months is really impressive .I agree with Kate , get everyone she meets to give her a very little treat , if she is hand shy they can gently toss it on the ground in front of her .You should give her frequent little treats too & make baby talk to her and see if she will let you very gently touch and tickle her .She will need to relax with you before she can start to trust others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.11514"}
