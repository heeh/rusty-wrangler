General Assembly .The agreement between Washington and Moscow came as Obama was pushing Congress to approve a military strike against Syria for a chemical weapons attack last month on civilians outside Damascus that the Obama administration says was carried out by Assad 's regime .The subsequent diplomatic steps agreed to by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov placed the threat of force on hold .Still , The Russians have challenged the administration 's claims of Assad culpability and Assad has blamed rebel forces for the attack .Obama aggressively pushed back against those claims in his speech Tuesday .\" It 's an insult to human reason and to the legitimacy of this institution to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out this attack , \" the president said .Obama also said that while the international community has recognized the stakes involved in the more than 2-year - old civil war , \" our response has not matched the scale of the challenge .\" Obama announced that the United States will provide $ 339 million in additional humanitarian aid to refugees and countries affected by the Syrian civil war , bringing the total American aid devoted to that crisis to nearly $ 1.4 billion .The White House said the aid will include $ 161 million spent inside Syria for medical care , shelter and sanitation projects , with the remainder going to help Syrian refugees in Lebanon , Jordan , Iraq , Turkey and Egypt .Obama reiterated his demand that Assad can not continue to lead Syria , but said he would not use U.S. military force to depose him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.70707"}

Barack Obama from Illinois came out of nowhere and knocked down the inevitable Clinton .Clinton has been virtually grooming herself to be president since the ' 90s , and 2016 appeared to be her year .Who would really give the candidate that seemingly has the backing of the entire Democratic machine a run for her money ?No one expected a 74-year - old Jewish socialist from Vermont to lead a formidable fight against Wall Street and the Democratic empire .Sanders has encapsulated the populist and liberal fires in this country and , with the backing of America 's youth , has lead a surgical campaign against the Washington machine .This was the most electrifying debate of the election so far .Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley was there , but this was a battle between Clinton and Sanders , two black belts of American politics .These two powerhouse candidates entered the ring , throwing their best punches .Sanders needed an outstanding victory Sunday night .However , Clinton expertly attacked Sanders ' weak points .This was the Bernie Sanders debate .He brought the most policies to the table , he outlined tax plans and most questions were seemingly directed toward him .Sanders started this campaign with the image of a candidate who would n't be in for the long haul .With the election starting in two weeks , the debate was focused on America getting to know the Democratic socialist from Vermont .However , Clinton did not allow Sanders to hog the attention , and she expertly defended herself .The former First Lady did not spend much time appealing to America 's liberals - Sanders won that war .She dug in on centrist policies , appealing to voters who want realism , not idealism .This was a fight over the identity of the Democratic Party .Gloves Off : Sanders Goes After Clinton 's Relationships with Big Banks .Clinton 's nomination is not inevitable , and any doubters of the power of Sanders ' insurgency simply had to tune in and see the former secretary of state backed into a corner and having to play defense for the bulk of the debate .Sanders prides himself on not attacking his opposition , and he has mostly stayed away from attacking Clinton directly - let 's not forget about the famous \" sick and tired of your damn emails \" moment .However , this was the end of Mr. Nice Socialist Guy on Sunday .Sanders launched a full - frontal assault on Clinton 's \" cozy \" relationship with big banks , specifically Goldman Sachs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.750496"}

{"text": "Hillary Clinton , Bernie Sanders and the Real Definition of ' Progressive ' .At the Democratic debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on Thursday night , the candidates ' discussion of the issues branched into slightly unusual territory : semantics .It was a thorny debate - but , it turns out , the question of what it means to be progressive in America is even more complicated than that . \" Historians do n't have a definition [ of ' progressive ' ] and we 've argued for years over whether there is such a thing , \" says Charles Postel , an expert on the Progressive and Populist movements who teaches history at San Francisco State University .Yes , there was a specific Progressive Party ( a.k.a the Bull Moose Party , which backed Theodore Roosevelt 's 1912 run for the White House ) and a specific Progressive Era , during the first 15 or 20 years of the 20th century .\" This is something that historians now talk about as the ' long Progressive Era , ' \" Postel says .What 's striking about the more narrowly defined Progressive Era , Postel adds , is not so much that reformers had new ideas during that time but that they were remarkably successful in getting things done .And with so many activists making strides , it 's hard to say who should get credit for starting things or which causes were most central .But , while it 's hard to pinpoint a beginning and end for the Progressive Era , it 's a bit easier to list the reforms that set it apart .Postel argues that today 's use of the word \" progressive \" is n't substantively different from the modern use of the word \" liberal , \" which has its own , perhaps even more complicated history .During the Reagan years , \" liberal \" acquired a bad reputation and eventually \" progressive\"-with a lower - case \" p\"-came back . )But there 's a logic to the Democratic candidates wanting that linguistic link to the early Progressives .First of all , Postel says , it 's worth noting that today 's politicians who claim the progressive mantel do share a lot with their forebears .Sanders ' respect for Eugene Debs , the socialist leader of the Progressive Era , who believed that the Progressive Party had stolen the Socialist platform , is well known .As for Clinton , the historian sees a strong connection between the political stances and personal lives of the candidate and Jane Addams , one of the foremost female activists of the Progressive Era .And the policies that mark a modern candidate as progressive are generally ones that would be recognized by the reformers of a century ago . \"Today racial justice is an integral part of progressivism . \" )So , given all that history , are today 's Democratic candidates truly progressive ?Is one more progressive that the other ?Who was right on Thursday ?If you ask Postel , both candidates were correct , but in slightly different ways .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.76961"}

Bush and Richard Nixon , the Republican Party has moved much further to the right in recent years .This leaves the question as to whether it will matter if Clinton or a Republican wins - which is more difficult to say without knowing which Republican will be the GOP nominee .It is definitely possible that there will be no meaningful difference with regards to foreign policy and civil liberties issues if Clinton or a Republican wins .There is the danger that the next president will be hostile to government transparency , and nobody has reached the level of the Clinton corruption in using the office of the presidency to enhance their personal worth .We will probably see a continuation of the surveillance state and of the drug war regardless of whether Clinton or a Republican wins .The biggest danger in a Clinton presidency would be that many Democrats will support conservative policies , leaving a weak liberal opposition to her policies , while there would be greater unity in opposing what might even be the exact same policies coming from Republicans .The biggest upside to Clinton winning over the Republicans might be that after campaigning as a progressive for the nomination , she will continue to govern as one .At very least Clinton would support a handful of liberal positions such as reproductive rights if elected .While this would be favorable , it is hardly enough to be happy with the prospect of her election considering her many conservative views .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.39421"}

Rand Paul ( Republican )Fun fact : Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is a practicing ophthalmologist that specializes in corneal transplants , cataract and glaucoma surgeries and LASIK procedures .The 52-year - old constitutional conservative has spent time during every senate recess performing pro - bono eye surgeries for low income Kentuckians and citizens of poor countries like Haiti .Even if he wins the presidency , Paul claims he will continue his practice and joked about turning the Lincoln room into a surgical suite .It 's probably safe crown Paul as having one of the greatest political ads in a long time , courtesy of America 's Liberty PAC .What 's up with the campaign ?Paul is probably the most libertarian candidate of the bunch .He 's all about citing the 10th Amendment , dreams of abolishing the IRS and wants to severely cut the defense budget and end the surveillance state .He 's also one of the only Republicans that seemingly has the backing of millennials .He has all the ingredients of a solid Republican candidate , a true conservative that literally takes a chainsaw to the tax code and genuinely wants to dismantle the \" Washington Machine .\" Even liberals can appreciate his non - interventionist foreign policy agenda and acknowledging the threat of climate change .However , the crowded GOP race has n't treated Paul nicely .He has struggled to make it to five percent in national polls , fighting for scraps with Carly Fiorina and Gov. Chris Christie .Some point to Paul 's troubles being that libertarianism is an extreme minority in America 's political landscape , which would also explain his father 's performance when he ran for president .In a 2014 study , Pew Research found that only 11 percent of Americans identify as Libertarians and know what it is .Conservatives say they want a smaller government , but that 's not what we see in the astonishing support for Donald Trump and Dr. Ben Carson who call for expanding surveillance programs and a further expansion of the government 's military footprint .Paul 's attack on Sen. Marco Rubio for being \" liberal on military spending \" gets roaring applause from a Republican audience ; aggressive military spending , however , creates an even bigger applause line .It 's worth pointing out that if the White House does n't work out , he 's also running for reelection in Kentucky 's 2016 senate race .He invokes the 10th Amendment and classic libertarian values regarding pot , saying the only victim is the individual and that the federal government should n't have a role in controlling consumption .Paul wants less people in jail and shines a light on the victims of marijuana prohibition mostly being poor black males .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.67088"}

Bush did it ) .The infatuation that Fox has for Putin is palpable .But it is also opportunistic .They only admire him so long as they can convert their idolatry of Putin into disparagement of Obama .They tried the same thing with conflicts involving Syria and Iran , but after the administration 's success in forcing both countries to retreat from their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction , Fox News likewise retreated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.767395"}

{"text": "Crisis Scenario # 4 is the money scenario .This is where Palin said that \" After the Russian Army invaded the nation of Georgia , Senator Obama 's reaction was one of indecision and moral equivalence , the kind of response that would only encourage Russia 's Putin to invade Ukraine next . \"Notice that Palin did not say what Obama 's response was or why it would encourage Putin in future military endeavors .For the record , here is what both Obama and John McCain said at the time : .Obama : There is no possible justification for these attacks .I reiterate my call for Russia to stop its bombing campaign , to stop flights of Russian aircraft in Georgian airspace , and to withdraw its ground forces from Georgia .McCain : Russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign Georgian territory .If Obama was indecisive and lacking moral fortitude , it was in exactly the same measure as Palin 's running mate , McCain .Palin 's remarks were nothing more than the typical carping that occurs in campaigns that have nothing of substance to say .Instead , Palin asserts an absurd scenario wherein Putin would require \" encouragement \" to engage in military aggression , as if he 's looking to the west for validation .If that 's so , what did George W.

Bernie Sanders was asked about criminal justice reform Thursday night , and said mass incarceration of minorities was \" one of the great tragedies in our country today . \"He went on to assert that \" a male African - American baby born today stands a 1 in 4 chance of ending up in jail .\" Are the numbers really that high ?In fact , according to the Sentencing Project , the numbers are more staggering than Sanders claimed .The nonprofit , which researches racial disparities in the criminal justice system , released a report in 2013 with a stark conclusion : \" If current trends continue , one of every three black American males born today can expect to go to prison in his lifetime .\" That report was submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Committee .The NAACP , on its website , also includes these same figures on mass incarceration .There is some question over the freshness of these statistics -- some of the conclusions in the Sentencing Project report are based on studies that are 15 years old and there are criminal sentencing reforms happening in many states that may make a difference .But the underlying claim is not an assertion of fact , it is a projection based on historical trends .So , if anything , based on the existing projections , Sanders understated the likelihood of African Americans ending up in jail .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.08439"}

{"text": "And that is Trump , who questioned Obama 's eligibility .Ted Cruz 's own Harvard Law Professor , Laurence H. Tribe , is questioning his eligibility .From the Boston Globe January 11 , 2016 .By Laurence H. Tribe .\" There 's more than meets the eye in the ongoing dustup over whether Ted Cruz is eligible to serve as president , which under the Constitution comes down to whether he 's a \" natural born citizen \" despite his 1970 Canadian birth .Senator Cruz contends his eligibility is \" settled \" by naturalization laws Congress enacted long ago .But those laws did n't address , much less resolve , the matter of presidential eligibility , and no Supreme Court decision in the past two centuries has ever done so .In truth , the constitutional definition of a \" natural born citizen \" is completely unsettled , as the most careful scholarship on the question has concluded .Needless to say , Cruz would never take Donald Trump 's advice to ask a court whether the Cruz definition is correct , because that would in effect confess doubt where Cruz claims there is certainty .People are entitled to their own opinions about what the definition ought to be .But the kind of judge Cruz says he admires and would appoint to the Supreme Court is an \" originalist , \" one who claims to be bound by the narrowly historical meaning of the Constitution 's terms at the time of their adoption .To his kind of judge , Cruz ironically would n't be eligible , because the legal principles that prevailed in the 1780s and ' 90s required that someone actually be born on US soil to be a \" natural born \" citizen .Even having two US parents would n't suffice .And having just an American mother , as Cruz did , would have been insufficient at a time that made patrilineal descent decisive .From Mary Brigid McManamon , constitutional law professor , January 12 , 2016 .Donald Trump is actually right about something : Sen. Ted Cruz ( R - Tex . ) is not a natural - born citizen and therefore is not eligible to be president or vice president of the United States .The Constitution provides that \" No person except a natural born Citizen . . .shall be eligible to the Office of President .\" The concept of \" natural born \" comes from common law , and it is that law the Supreme Court has said we must turn to for the concept 's definition .On this subject , common law is clear and unambiguous .The 18th - century English jurist William Blackstone , the preeminent authority on it , declared natural - born citizens are \" such as are born within the dominions of the crown of England , \" while aliens are \" such as are born out of it .\" The key to this division is the assumption of allegiance to one 's country of birth .The Americans who drafted the Constitution adopted this principle for the United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.934296"}

T. & T. , Verizon , and BellSouth , which for decades have had classified relationships with the N.S.A.-began providing wiretap recordings of N.S.A. targets .The content of e - mails followed shortly afterward .By November , a couple of weeks after the secret computer servers were delivered , phone and Internet metadata from the three phone companies began flowing to the N.S.A. servers over classified lines or on compact disks .Twenty N.S.A. employees , working around the clock in a new Metadata Analysis Center , at the agency 's headquarters , conducted the kind of sophisticated contact chaining of terrorist networks that the Clinton Justice Department had disallowed .On October 31st , the cover term for the program was changed to STELLARWIND .Nearly everyone involved wondered whether the program was legal .Hayden did n't ask his own general counsel , Robert Deitz , for his opinion until after Bush signed the order .( Deitz told Hayden he believed that it was legal . )John Yoo , a Justice Department lawyer , wrote a legal opinion , the full text of which has never been disclosed , arguing that the plan was legal .When Deitz tried to obtain the text , Addington refused his request but read him some excerpts over the phone .Hayden never asked for the official legal opinion and never saw it , according to the inspector general 's report .In May , 2002 , the N.S.A. briefed Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly , the incoming chief of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , about the program .She was shown a short memo from the Department of Justice defending its legality , but was n't allowed to keep a copy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.8533"}

{"text": "Muslims often claim that their religion only orders them to kill in self - defense ( ie .when their own lives are in danger ) .The Truth : .In fact , self - defense is just one of several conditions under which Muslims are permitted to take the lives of others .The myth of killing only in self - defense is easily disproved from the accounts of Muhammad 's own life as recorded in Islam 's sacred texts ( with which Muslim terrorists are only too familiar ) .Muhammad 's career of killing began with raids on merchant caravans traveling between Syria and Mecca .His men would usually sneak up on unsuspecting drivers and kill those who defended their goods .There was no self - defense involved here at all ( on the part of the Muslims , at least ) .This was old - fashioned armed robbery and murder - sanctioned by Allah ( according to Muhammad , who also demanded a fifth of the loot for himself ) .The very first battle that Muhammad fought was at Badr , when a Meccan army of 300 was sent out to protect the caravans from Muslim raids .The Meccans did not threaten Muhammad , and ( turning this Muslim myth on its ear ) only fought in self - defense after they were attacked by the Muslims .Following the battle , Muhammad established the practice of executing surrendered captives - something that would be repeated on many other occasions .The significance of this episode can hardly be overstated , because it lies at the very beginning of the long chain of Muslim violence that eventually passed right through the heart of America on September 11th .The early Muslims were not being threatened by those whom they attacked , and certainly not by those whom they had captured .They staged aggressive raids to eventually provoke war , just as al - Qaeda attempts to do in our time .Muslims try to justify Muhammad 's violence by claiming that he and his followers \" suffered persecution \" at the hands of the Meccans in an earlier episode , in which Muhammad was evicted from the city of Mecca and had to seek refuge at Medina .But even the worst of this persecution did not rise to the level of killing .Nor were Muhammad and his Muslims in any danger at all in their new home of Medina .They were free to get on with their lives .Even Muhammad 's own men evidently questioned whether they should be pursuing and killing people who did not pose a threat to them , since it seemed to contradict earlier , more passive teachings .To convince them , Muhammad passed along a timely revelation from Allah stating that \" the persecution of Muslims is worse than slaughter [ of non - Muslims ] \" ( Sura 2:191 ) .This verse established the tacit principle that the authority of Muslims is of higher value even than the very lives of others .There is no larger context of morality against which acts are judged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.72681"}
