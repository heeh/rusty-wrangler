Bush .And now , Jeb Bush is hoping to continue the family 's winning streak here next Saturday .But achieving that will be an uphill climb for the latest Bush to run for president .In a cycle overwhelmingly dominated by two anti - establishment candidates , the former Florida governor has struggled to vault himself to the top - tier of the crowded GOP field .The closest thing to victory that Bush has experienced this cycle was on Tuesday in New Hampshire , when he came in at fourth place in the GOP contest there .He was virtually tied with Marco Rubio and trailed behind Trump , Cruz and Kasich .But coming in second or third place within the establishment lane is far less acceptable for Bush here in South Carolina than in New Hampshire .He is hoping that his family name will be a plus in this southern state , and in North Charleston on Monday , Bush will have his brother , George W. Bush , campaigning next to him for the first time .Saturday , expect to hear Bush make an explicit case for why he is the best to take on Trump or Cruz -- and even remind people of his family 's history of winning here . \"He 's the last Republican that was president .He is the most popular Republican alive , \" Bush told reporters Thursday . \"He has made tough decisions as president .All of that , I think , is important for people to be reminded of .\" Winning the military and veterans ' votes .Two constituencies in South Carolina will be key in determining the winner of the GOP South Carolina primary : military personnel and veterans .The state is home to more than 400,000 veterans and some 38,000 active duty military members , according to recent estimates .That means issues like national security , military spending and the treatment of veterans are likely to be front and center at Saturday 's debate .And the candidates on the debate stage have their share of vulnerabilities .For Trump , it may be a comment he made about John McCain on the campaign trail -- questioning the former GOP presidential nominee 's status as a Vietnam War hero -- that could come back to haunt him .Cruz has already come under fire from his rivals for voting for a budget that would have cut military spending .The Texas senator has hit back at that charge by pointing out that he supported an amendment to boost military spending .Kasich 's past support for closing military facilities is also likely to be met with disapproval in a state that has eight military bases .Meanwhile , Bush is hoping that the endorsement from Sen. Lindsey Graham -- along with George W. Bush , who is popular in South Carolina , hitting the trail for him -- can win him points with the influential veterans and military community .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.97214"}
