'And I do n't know .He 's not a native Hawaiian .Where was he born ?I do n't know .Supposedly Hawaii , but we do n't have independent confirmation of it . \"In July 2009 , Limbaugh was still endorsing the birther movement by referring to Obama as having \" no birth certificate .\" Limbaugh was leery of announcing that Obama had been born in Kenya , but his tacit endorsement of the birthers was still clear .WorldNetDaily editor - in - chief Joseph Farah ( ghostwriter of Limbaugh 's second book , and leader of a campaign to put up \" Where 's the Birth Certificate ? \" billboards around the country ) noted the importance of Limbaugh 's stand with the birthers : \" What that did is beyond Rush 's impact .It also gives other talk show hosts license to talk about this issue ....

Gaylord Nelson .The main organizer of the first Earth Day in 1970 was Denis Hayes .The first Earth Day was a nationwide phenomenon .The Philadelphia Earth Week was organized by a committee of 33 people , and it does not appear that Ira Einhorn was one of them .In Rush 's defense , some of the misinformation on his show came from a badly written piece by Remy Melina reprinted on MSNBC.com titled , \" Earth Day co - founder killed , composted girlfriend .\" That title alone should warn readers of the bias that would follow .Einhorn was a crackpot who called himself an environmentalist to help get himself attention .In 1977 , he murdered his girlfriend and hid her body in a trunk in his apartment , where the mummified body was later found .This is the \" composted \" girlfriend being mocked in the headline and the story .Since decomposed bodies have nothing to do with composting ( in fact , the body was found underneath some Styrofoam packing material ) , the only reason for putting this word in the story is to try to demean environmentalists .Melina 's article claims : \" Although Einhorn was only the master of ceremonies at the first Earth Day event , he maintains that Earth Day was his idea and that he 's responsible for launching it .\" It 's not clear that Einhorn really still maintains that Earth Day was his idea , since he 's serving a life sentence in prison and it does n't appear that Melina talked with him or did any actual journalism for her article .( Melina 's bio , by the way , indicates that \" Remy has written for the Long Island Press and Shut Up !Magazine . \")A Philadelphia Inquirer article from ten years ago , easily found on the web , revealed that Einhorn was n't the founder of Earth Day , nor was he the host of the Philadelphia Earth Day celebration .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.93861"}
{"text": "Almost all Greek heroes were said to be born of a human woman and a god - even Alexander the Great , Augustus and Pythagoras .The father typically was Zeus or Apollo .The god would come and sleep with the woman , pretending to be the husband or as a bolt of lightning , or some such .Greek mythology also shows up in the book of Genesis : the gods lusting after the women and coming down and mating with them .Why were they added to the Christian story ?Nugent : Jewish Christians , the first Christians , did n't believe in the virgin birth .They believed that Joseph was the biological father of Jesus .Part of their Christology was \" adoptionism\"-they thought Jesus was adopted as the unique son of God at some time later in life .There were disagreements about when - Mark suggests the baptism , Paul suggests the resurrection .Over time , gentile Christianity replaced Jewish Christianity .There were Jewish - Roman Wars .The Jewish Christians were marginalized and oppressed .The Gentile branch became dominant .Eventually we get the gospel of John which pushes the sonship of Jesus back to the beginning of time .This writer is at the other end of the spectrum from the Jewish Christians .But Matthew and Luke think that the sonship of Jesus began at birth .And they want to tell a story that reinforces this point .Matthew and Luke are the source of the Christmas story as most of us learned it .Why did n't the writers do a better job of cleaning the contradictions ?Nugent : They did , some .This is called the \" orthodox corruption of scripture .\" But it appears that these birth stories were added toward the end , so scripture got frozen before they could get integrated .I was raised that the bible was the literally perfect , \" inerrant \" word of God , essentially dictated by God to the writers .What you are saying about the Christmas story sure calls into question this point of view .Nugent : Which Bible ? !There are thousands of manuscript variations .Most biblical stories are probably fiction , not non - fiction .They are mythology in the deepest sense of the word .But we need to get beyond issue of whether biblical reports happened in the historical , physical sense to understand what they mean spiritually and mythically .Ok .Back to Christmas .Of all the images from the Christmas story , the one that people fall in love with most is angels .The Christmas story is full of angels , beings of light .Is this because of the solstice tradition ?Nugent : Actually it comes from the Hebrew Bible , the Jewish scriptures that were eventually adopted into the Christian Bible as the Old Testament .It also comes from the Jewish literature written between the Old and New Testaments that did n't get into the biblical canon .Some of these are even quoted in the New Testament , for example Enoch , from the 2nd Century BC .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.958466"}

{"text": "Like the bumper sticker says , \" Who would Jesus waterboard ? \" If Christ 's torture and crucifixion mean anything , I think they mean that we should put an end to such practices in human affairs .Right - wing evangelical Christianity is really the opposite of what Christ was about .The intolerant and arrogant form of Christianity is in a real sense , to me , the religion of the Antichrist .Great post !I first heard of Valerie on the Mark Mythos show and really enjoyed listening to her , as well as learned a lot .I then ran out and bought her book .I found her to be an inspiration .I enjoyed the article because I do see the stories in the Bible as myths .However , there is a human condition described in some stories like the one about the Good Sumeritian .His actions came from the heart .He was n't expecting any reward or punishment for his actions .He just helped out of the goodness of his heart , which is a common story in many religions .Not the exact story , but helping from your heart , not out of a sense of duty .Now , I 'm a Humanist who does n't believe in a historical Jesus or the god of religion- any religion , but I do understand what this man is talking about as to the myths having a message .Sort of like Aesop 's Fables .They are n't historical nor are they real in any way , but do something to them that is valuable .Not in a religious sense or dogmatic sense , but as in the human condition .Many of the stories are similar in format , yet written for a specific culture .Buddha , Krishna , Horus , etc all had virgin births that deal with the constellations , which is well seen in Buddha and Krishna 's stories .Same template , but directed to a specific group of people .People do n't have to accept them as real historical truths , with a real deity .That is actually a mistake that was imposed on the people when Rome took over .Instead they are sun - gods , as Nugent stated and in the past people did n't take the stories as being actual human beings .They understood the astrotheology behind them , which has been buried in the stories we read today .We have forgotten that they are merly fables with no actual deity behind them .They are just stories about rising and dying Sun gods , which is esp .noticed in the stories of Krishna and Buddha 's birth .At one time I would not have even ventured into other religions , but thanks to Robert Price , Victor Matthews ( professor and author of Old Testament Parallels ) , and Acharya 's encouragement , I did and found the astrotheology they 've mentioned .When you view them in this manner , the myths take on a whole new character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.73366"}
