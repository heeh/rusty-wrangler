[The ] Libyan crisis teaches the international world a serious lesson .It proved [ that ] peace can be preserved only when one builds up one 's own strength .[ 4 ] .Pyongyang has made clear that it has no intention of complying with UN resolutions demanding its denuclearization nor fulfilling its Six Party Talks pledges to abandon its nuclear weapons .North Korea has declared : . \"Pyongyang will not unilaterally abandon its war deterrence .North Korea 's nuclear weapons are the ultimate defender of national interest and a trusted shield to defend peace .\" [ 5 ] .North Korea 's nuclear weapons \" are not goods for getting U.S. dollars and they are neither a political bargaining chip nor a thing for economic dealings .The DPRK 's possession of nuclear weapons shall be fixed by law and the nuclear armed forces should be expanded and beefed up qualitatively and quantitatively .\" [ 6 ] .\" The six - party talks and the joint September 19 [ 2005 ] statement were rendered null and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was put to an end .There will be no more discussion over denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula .\" [ 7 ] .North Korea revised its constitution in 2012 to declare itself a \" nuclear - armed state .\" [ 8 ] .\" Those who talk about an economic reward in return for the dismantlement of [ North Korea 's ] nuclear weapons would be well advised to awake from their daydream .\" [ 9 ] .\" We have tightened our belts , braved various difficulties and spent countless amounts of money to obtain a nuclear deterrent as a self - defense measure against U.S. nuclear threats .Only fools will entertain the delusion that we will trade our nuclear deterrent for petty economic aid .\" [ 10 ] .President Obama and the US Congress will debate and eventually resolve whether the US should initiate military action against Syria for its use of chemical weapons against its citizens .The effects of the decision will reverberate long after the dust from the initial attack has settled .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "39.504936"}

{"text": "However , China has not been eager to use its leverage to deter Kim 's nuclear program .According to Dr. Andrew J.

{"text": "\" The crisis between Washington and P'yongyang that nearly brought us a new Korean War lasted for nearly two years , from the inauguration of Bill Clinton until the fall of 1994 .For the American press the crisis seemed to begin on March 12 , 1993 , when North Korea announced that it would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .Tens of thousands of American soldiers joined their South Korean counterparts in large war games that began in mid - March and included the deployment of such weaponry as the B-1B bomber , nuclear - capable B-52s from Guam , and several naval vessels carrying cruise missiles .This was the context in which North Korea announced that it was pulling out of the NPT .American war games in Korea used to be aimed at a potential Soviet- or Chinese - backed invasion , but since the demise of the USSR and the normalization of South Korean - Chinese relations they have been aimed only at the North and its nonnuclear , obsolescent military forces .The NPT does not deny to nations the right of self - defense , and it states that countries without nuclear weapons must not be threatened by those that possess them .With its threat to leave the NPT , North Korea played a strong card -- by implication , other near - nuclear powers might do the same .The NPT then current was due for renegotiation in 1995 .Soon Team Spirit ended , however , and quickly the North agreed to high - level talks with the United States and subsequently suspended its withdrawal from the NPT ( on June 11 , 1993 ) .Reading the North Korean press and listening to P'yongyang radio made clear that Team Spirit and a long history of U.S. nuclear threats were what motivated the North ; it had warned against resuming the games since the 1992 U.S. elections .Yet all during the crisis P'yongyang continued to call for good relations with the United States , amid its typical bombast against American imperialism .The other issue that energized P'yongyang in early 1993 was the IAEA 's demand to carry out \" special inspections \" of two undeclared sites in North Korea , which the IAEA said were nuclear - waste dumps .( The North Koreans claimed that the waste sites were military installations , and therefore off limits . )The IAEA had never before demanded such an inspection in any other country , but it was under international pressure for not having ferreted out several sites in Iraq that were discovered after Baghdad was defeated .( As we saw above , that is precisely what some high - level American officials advocated . ) P'yongyang lambasted the IAEA for following the desiderata of its sworn enemy , the United States , and for not demanding equal time to see what the United States might be doing at its many installations in South Korea .For once , in short , the United States used deft diplomacy to defuse a Korean crisis .The Clinton Administration deserves commendation for this astute and adroit effort .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.37043"}

Han Min - koo , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , recently promised that in case of another North Korean attack , his forces \" will completely crush the enemy .\" This talk is what the Seoul street wants to hear .In a recent poll , 80 percent of South Koreans said they would support a military retaliation in the event of a fresh North Korean attack .Only six months ago , when a North Korean torpedo sank a South Korean warship , killing 46 sailors , merely 30 percent favored a military option .Alas , this shift is not good news , for the hard truth is that restraint is the only option for South Korea .At best , military retaliation would merely be harmful .At worst , it will lead to disaster .In the past , the South Korean public and government have demonstrated almost inhuman patience every time they faced a North Korean provocation - and they have had to face such provocations regularly .How did South Korea react to all these acts ?In the same , time - tested way : by doing nothing .This unusual restraint reflects the grim reality of the South Korean situation .Half the country 's entire population , some 24 million people , live in the capital Seoul and its vicinity , well within the range of North Korean artillery .The country 's infrastructure is highly developed and hence highly vulnerable .Since the late 1950s , war has simply not been an option , as Seoul 's frustrated strategists assumed that a retaliatory strike would lead to war - or else prove useless .This assumption was probably correct .North Korea watchers often describe its provocative actions as either irrational or driven by succession politics .This time , Kim Jong Il 's drive to install his son as his heir does seem involved , but on balance Pyongyang 's recent attacks are rational acts - essentially diplomatic demarches , albeit undertaken in somewhat unusual form .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.702667"}

'He further said : . \" Thousands of our courageous sons and millions of brave South Vietnamese have answered aggression 's onslaught and they have answered it with one strong and one united voice . 'No retreat , ' they have said .Free men will never bow to force and abandon their future to tyranny .That must be our answer , too , here at home .Our answer here at home , in every home , must be : No retreat from the responsibilities of the hour of the day .It is inconceivable that Johnson 's assertive , \" no retreat \" views about the war would have swung so immediately , and so dramatically , upon hearing the opinion of a television news anchor .An opinion that was hardly exceptional , novel , or shocking in late February 1968 .By the time of Cronkite 's report , \" stalemate \" had become an unremarkable - and not uncommon - way to characterize the war in Vietnam .The Times , for example , had invoked \" stalemate \" months before Cronkite 's television report , notably in a front - page news analysis published August 7 , 1967 .In it , the Times observed that \" the war is not going well .Victory is not close at hand .The Times analysis , filed from Vietnam , further declared : . \" ' Stalemate ' is a fighting word in Washington .President Johnson rejects it as a description of the situation in Vietnam .But it is the word used by almost all Americans here , except the top officials , to characterize what is happening .The analysis was published on the Times front page , beneath the headline : .Moreover , even if Johnson later heard - or heard about - Cronkite 's \" mired in stalemate \" assessment , it represented no epiphany .If the president later heard - or heard about - Cronkite 's analysis , he did n't take it to heart in his public statements .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.424294"}

{"text": "His policy of unilateralism , proclaimed at West Point in 2002 , marked a radical turn in U.S. foreign policy .President Bush ineffectually relied on saber - rattling against the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea .He abrogated the Anti - Ballistic Missile Treaty , the cornerstone of deterrence since 1972 , and he funded a national missile defense system that is not workable but remains the largest line item for a weapons system in the current defense budget .The Bush administration 's politicization of the intelligence community reached its nadir in 2002 , when the CIA prepared the specious National Intelligence Estimate that was used to justify the war against Iraq .Even before the end of the Cold War , there had been an unfortunate tendency for U.S. presidents , in their first year in office , to use military or paramilitary power as an instrument of policy , perhaps to prove their mettle .President John F. Kennedy used the CIA against Cuba ( the infamous Bay of Pigs ) , an operation that backfired and tarnished his administration .President Lyndon B. Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam in 1965 , although , in his campaign the previous year , he had argued against sending American boys to fight an Asian war .President Nixon escalated the war in Vietnam and fought a secret war in Cambodia .President Gerald Ford used force in response to the seizure of a U.S. freighter , although the crew had already been released .There were more U.S. forces killed and wounded in that action than there were crew members of the merchant ship , the Mayaguez .And the intelligence community sent the rescue team to an obscure island rather than to the mainland , where the crew had been held .President Jimmy Carter actually avoided the use of military force until his last year in office .Even in the wake of 9/11 , when George Bush and Dick Cheney significantly increased the defense budget , Senator Lieberman argued that the additional funds were \" not nearly enough to meet the military 's essential needs for procurement and transformation .\" Senator Lieberman was the classic reincarnation of the late Senator Henry \" Scoop \" Jackson ( D - WA ) , liberal on domestic social issues but far to the right on national security and defense issues .The Lieberman link to the politics of Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina has been a powerful force on behalf of the military - industrial complex for two decades .President George H.W. Bush made no one happy during his stewardship of U.S. national security policy .Liberals believed that he could have taken better advantage of the end of the Cold War to address inflated defense spending and unnecessary U.S. deployments abroad .Neoconservatives believed that he did not expand the defense budget sufficiently and was absurdly dovish in not occupying Iraq and driving Saddam Hussein from power .In many ways , Bush was a traditional fiscal conservative who was not in favor of great increases in defense spending .Secretary of Defense Cheney was sympathetic with this position , but , after his employment by the defense contractor Halliburton in the 1990s , he returned to government in order to open the floodgates of defense spending .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.465534"}

{"text": "A remarkable opinion poll was published recently , conducted by the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland .It found that one third of the American public believed that American military forces had found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .Some 22 percent said that Iraq had actually used chemical or biological weapons in the war .Other polls have reported that some 50 percent of those questioned believed Iraqi citizens participated in the September 11 attacks , while 40 percent believed that Saddam Hussein directly assisted the hijack - bombers .Such findings are an indictment of the role of the American media in systematically misinforming and confusing the American people .But they also demonstrate that the supposedly widespread public support for the war in Iraq rests on sand .The process of media manipulation has definite limits .Like the Bush administration , the media has discredited itself in the eyes of tens of millions of people , who recognize that both government spokesmen and their media counterparts lie without scruple or limit .The coming reckoning .The supreme role of the lie in US politics reflects not simply the cynicism of the media , but rather the enormity of the social contradictions within America .The United States is the most deeply class - divided of all the industrial nations .It is a country whose social relations - dominated by vast disparities of wealth - are increasingly antithetical to any form of democracy , and instead conform to rule by a financial oligarchy .It is impossible for the ruling class to give an honest accounting for a system that heaps up riches for the privileged few , while driving down the living standards of the vast majority of the population .These social tensions are leading inexorably to major political upheavals .The exposure of the Bush administration 's claims about weapons of mass destruction has already had a colossal impact overseas , where British Prime Minister Tony Blair is being openly accused of lying to Parliament and the British people .The reaction in the United States is less visible , in large measure because of the collapse of liberalism and the absence of any even remotely critical stance either in the media or the Democratic Party .There is mass popular opposition to the Bush administration 's policies , and genuine outrage over the war in Iraq , but this finds no expression in any section of the mass media or political establishment .Sooner rather than later , however , the contradictions of American imperialism must find a political outlet .As the situation in Iraq deteriorates , the other basic lie of the war , the claim that the US would replace Saddam Hussein with a democratic regime , is being thoroughly exposed .The US occupation regime has already begun to engage in measures - provocative searches of Iraqi neighborhoods , shooting down unarmed demonstrators , suppression of planned elections - characteristic of a military dictatorship .The number one priority of the occupiers is to restart Iraq 's oil industry and carry out its privatization , so that the country 's oil wealth can be looted by American corporations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.399895"}

{"text": "Pulling back from Vietnam would not have undermined international or domestic confidence in Kennedy 's direction of foreign affairs , especially given that poll data from as late as April of 1964 showed only 37 percent of the American public paying any attention to developments in Vietnam .Even in the spring and summer of 1965 , after Johnson had begun a systematic bombing campaign and had dispatched 100,000 soldiers to the region , few Americans expected to see a victory in South Vietnam .In April of that year 45 percent of Americans polled predicted that a neutral or pro - communist government would take control of Saigon within the next five years ; only 22 percent believed that Saigon would remain on Washington 's side .By August most Americans assumed that the war would end with a compromise or , like the Korean War , with a negotiated settlement .In short , if a second - term Kennedy Administration had withdrawn U.S. fighting forces from Vietnam in 1965 , few Americans would have felt that the United States had forfeited a chance at victory .Johnson , in contrast , had few credentials as a world statesman and did not think he could deal effectively with communist adversaries abroad or conservative critics at home if he retreated from a Cold War challenge in Vietnam .When his need to demonstrate his foreign - policy toughness was coupled with his sincere belief in a war he saw as essential to containing communism , the result was a foreign - policy disaster .In counterfactual history nothing is certain .But we do know that in November of 1963 Kennedy was strongly leaning both toward reducing tensions with Castro and against expanding commitments in Vietnam .And most historians agree that Kennedy , like Johnson , would have faced Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election and defeated him by a wide margin , just as Johnson did .This would have given Kennedy , now free from concern about re - election , the mandate to make a bold foreign - policy change while staring down his military advisers .Most Popular .After decades of anticipation , we have directly detected gravitational waves - ripples in spacetime traveling at the speed of light through the universe .Scientists at LIGO ( the Laser Interferometic Gravitational - wave Observatory ) have announced that they have measured waves coming from the inspiral of two massive black holes , providing a spectacular confirmation of Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity , whose hundredth anniversary was celebrated just last year .Finding gravitational waves indicates that Einstein was ( once again ) right , and opens a new window onto energetic events occurring around the universe .But there 's a deeper lesson , as well : a reminder of the central importance of locality , an idea that underlies much of modern physics .Ben Stiller 's follow - up to his own comedy classic is a downright bummer , no matter how many celebrity cameos it tries to cram in .You do n't need to go to the theater to get the full experience of Zoolander 2 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.17633"}

{"text": "Several are apparent here .First , American policymakers need to reconsider what it means when they discuss another Korean War .It is possible that the next conflict on the peninsula will occur as a North Korean civil war , a conflict into which China may be drawn , or even between North Korea and Japan .For decades , American planners have anticipated a war between the two Koreas or between Pyongyang and Washington , but this assumption is no longer obviously valid .To further complicate matters , China may be central to a North Korean civil war , propping up one side against another - such a role could end quite well for China , in which a reformist leader emerges who nonetheless keeps North Korea firmly in Beijing 's camp .But it could end disastrously , with the ouster of Chinese influence and perhaps even a state of war between China and a new anti - Chinese leadership in Pyongyang .Any outcome would cut to the heart of the Sino - American competition for influence in Asia , as well as the risk that the competition could spill out into a regional conflict .The possibility of a North Korean attack on Japan reflects two changes in North Korea 's disposition in recent years .The appeal of an attack on Japan has grown as North Korean priorities have shifted from militarily imposed reunification to survival .A military strike against South Korea could quickly escalate to war .In contrast , an attack on Japan may appear almost risk - free to a North Korean leadership .Japan could not directly strike back , and the U.S. may not be willing to if there was no major damage to Japan .Of course , an attack on Japan could effectively drive a wedge between American , South Korean and Japanese interests .There are many reasons , in sum , for a Korean War to bypass South Korea and proceed directly to Tokyo .The second major lesson is the challenge that the fog of war will pose for America 's ability to monitor developments as they occur in North Korea .If North Korea were in the early stages of a civil war or a standoff against China , it may be difficult for the U.S. to even realize what was occurring .A North Korean missile strike against Japan could be conducted with almost no strategic warning .Although it would be almost impossible for North Korea to launch a major southward invasion without setting off alarm bells in Seoul and Washington , the U.S. now faces a situation in which the danger could fester quietly and explode suddenly .Combined , these lessons indicate that the U.S. risks being blindsided by a conflict that it is not adequately prepared for .Having long anticipated the likelihood of renewed inter - Korean hostilities , the U.S. may indeed be preparing for the last Korean War rather than the next one .POLITICAL WILL .If the U.S. does not act to redefine its Asian alliances in the face of the evolving North Korean threat , Pyongyang may well redefine them for us .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.472366"}

Kennedy used the CIA against Cuba ( the infamous Bay of Pigs ) , an operation that backfired and tarnished his administration .President Lyndon B.

{"text": "The alliance suddenly would be faced with a key test as Washington would have to decide whether to risk a greater conflict in an effort to demonstrate the credibility of its commitment to Japan 's defense .This scenario could reach an array of conclusions , but the almost immediate tactical solution would be for the U.S. , North Korea and China to strike a three - way deal that would resolve most of their immediate concerns .After all , each has something to offer the other two parties : . \u00e5 China could provide North Korea with recognition for the rump regime and assurances regarding the country 's sovereignty .China also could provide Washington with a guarantee that no future attacks from North Korea would be tolerated .\u00e5 North Korea could promise both the U.S. and China that it would not conduct another such attack in the future .Such a promise could meet both Beijing 's need for the survival of its buffer state and Washington 's desire to avoid an unnecessary war .\u00e5 The U.S. could provide the pressure that allows a resolution of the Sino - North Korean standoff on Pyongyang 's terms and , by not retaliating , allows North Korea to survive .As important , the U.S. would be expected to rein in any Japanese response in the future .This tactical solution establishes something like the status quo ante .After all , North Korea would continue to exist under a new songun regime , China would sustain a relatively robust buffer state along its border , and the U.S. would have the same apparent position in Asia as it did before the crisis .But the cost would be profound : The United States would have largely undermined its position in Asia .The most damning evidence of a weakened American position in Asia would be the permanent damage to the U.S.-Japanese alliance .Not only would the alliance have failed to protect Japan from an initial strike , but it also would have emerged as an obstacle to any independent Japanese response .For the part of American policymakers , the diplomatic triumph that avoids war with North Korea would demonstrate that American diplomacy not only works best when it is unfettered by allies , but also perhaps when it betrays their vital interests .The U.S. also likely would suffer a crisis in its own confidence in the region .The value of Japan and South Korea as allies would be highly diminished , and the U.S. may find itself less interested in retaining a leadership role in Asian security .Indeed , the remaining factor compelling America to stay engaged may be its obligation to cooperate with China in a bid to jointly contain North Korea and Japan .In short , this scenario presents a world that looks very much like the one we live in , but in which the strategic logic has been flipped .The purpose of this exercise , however , is not to find the single solution but to distill the broader lessons that may be applied to a range of scenarios concerning a destabilized North Korea .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.524628"}

{"text": "North Korea presents a uniquely difficult challenge in this regard , for that country 's political system is almost impenetrable to confident analysis .Kim and his cronies take great efforts to shroud the inner workings of Pyongyang in secrecy .Faced with a dearth of concrete information , Western analysts are reduced to piecing together the likely twists of North Korean politics from anecdotal developments , ever - dubious statistics and propaganda , and their own assumptions .Will the Kim regime or any direct successor undertake real economic or political reform ?What role will China play in the future of North Korea ?The answer to any one of these three questions will have a tremendous effect on North Korea 's future ; moreover , the three are deeply interrelated .We know the North Korean regime is ill - prepared for the eventual death of Kim .Although groomed by his father , Kim Il Sung , for some 20 years to inherit the mantle of leadership , Kim has not made a similar investment in any of his sons or other possible successors .Although Kim has given his two eldest sons a series of appointments in recent years , his unexpected departure from the scene would leave a vacuum that may be filled by violence .The vagaries of North Korea 's dynastic politics might not be so dangerous if the regime was not facing a constant struggle for survival .Since the end of the Cold War , North Korea has weathered two nuclear crises with the Western powers , a devastating famine , international isolation and the death of its national founder .Today , North Korea remains intensely isolated as a bastion of militant communism .The fundamental question for Pyongyang remains a simple one : whether it should come in from the cold .Looking at the relative prosperity of China and Vietnam , the option of pursuing some type of reform may have been a tempting one for Kim when he succeeded his father in 1994 .Instead , he introduced the concept of \" songun , \" or \" military - first politics , \" through which Pyongyang has rejected any significant reform and instead developed the military as both the greatest political actor and , through international extortion , the bedrock of the economy .The next North Korean leader will have to decide whether to sustain Kim 's songun policy , and it seems that if there is an ideological element to a post - Kim power struggle , it will be over the question of reform .Finally , China looms in the background , casting its shadow over the questions of succession and reform .The Chinese government views North Korea as a vital strategic buffer against American military power but views the Kim regime as a loose cannon .The cost of supporting North Korea in peacetime is significant : Not only does Beijing subsidize its neighbor , but it also suffers from economic malaise and an unwanted refugee population in its provinces along the border .If North Korean bellicosity resulted in a regional war , China 's economy and precarious political order may collapse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.57029"}

Eisenhower presciently warned against in his farewell address more than fifty years ago .The United States lacks a strategic vision for a world without an enemy , and it continues to spend far more on defense , homeland security , and intelligence than the rest of the world combined .We are the only nation in the world that deploys its military primarily to support foreign policy rather than to defend our borders and people .U.S. corporations dominate the sales of military equipment , selling extremely sophisticated weapons to countries such as Saudi Arabia that have the hard currency to pay for them but lack the skill to use them .We have more than 700 military bases and facilities around the world ; few other countries have any .We can deploy eleven aircraft carriers ; among our rivals only China even plans to deploy one - and that is a revamped Ukrainian aircraft carrier , a carryover from the ancient Soviet inventory .U.S. militarization , reliance on the military to pursue foreign policy objectives better achieved by other means , has continued to expand since the end of the Cold War , when we might have expected and experienced a peace dividend .Military expansion during the Cold War , especially during peaks in the U.S. arms buildup against the Soviets and during the Vietnam War , at least had as its rationale the spectre of an aggressive Soviet Union .The key contributions to the Pentagon 's enhanced role have been President Bush 's doctrine of preemptive attack and the permanent War on Terror , or the Long War ; the misuse of power in Iraq ; and President Obama 's initial expansion of the war in Afghanistan .The Bush and Obama administrations have made sure that military figures dominate national security positions , and both administrations have failed to use the tools of diplomacy to deal effectively with foreign policy conflicts in the Middle East or with Iran or North Korea .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.546547"}

Bush helped to create this arc with his wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .Although President Obama has undertaken military disengagement in both countries , he has widened covert action throughout the area as the Pentagon and the CIA conduct assassination programs against insurgents and terrorists .These drones have been used against targets in Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , Pakistan , Yemen , and Somalia , according to State Department cables obtained by WikiLeaks , an anti - secrecy group .In addition to drone bases , U.S. secret facilities support special operations against dozens of countries from South America to Central Asia .Army Rangers , Navy Seals , and CIA personnel operate out of them .Military personnel are deployed throughout the Middle East and North Africa , and the Pentagon and the Department of State are training special forces from dozens of countries in the art of counterinsurgency .The New Yorker 's Seymour Hersh has been reporting for several years that the United States is conducting special operations in Iran , and the Wall Street Journal has reported that Pentagon and CIA teams are conducting covert operations to stop the smuggling of Iranian arms into Iraq .Such operations contribute to the increase in anti - Americanism throughout the region .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.156105"}

{"text": "Is America drifting towards civil war ?By Editorial Board 22 December 1998 .In the aftermath of Saturday 's vote to impeach President Bill Clinton , it has suddenly become clear that the United States is in the throes of a political crisis of historic dimensions .Even the media -- which throughout the year has covered the turmoil in Washington as if it were some sort of uproarious joke -- is beginning to recognize that what is happening is deadly serious , and may have deadly consequences .The most striking aspect of the debate that preceded the vote to impeach was its vitriol and viciousness .To find historical precedents for the bitterness of the political infighting one would have to go back , not simply to the last impeachment of a president in 1868 , but beyond that -- to the years that led up to the outbreak of civil war in 1861 .In the aftermath of the vote , Rep. Richard Gephardt , the Democratic minority leader , warned that politics in the United States were approaching the level of violence .There seems to be no obvious explanation for the ferocity of the political struggle between the Democrats and Republicans .This is -- according to the pundits -- a time of unprecedented prosperity , in which the United States , having \" won \" the Cold War , exercises unchallenged power as the world 's sole superpower .Why then , amidst these supposedly idyllic conditions , is the country 's political system approaching a state of collapse ?To argue that this situation is merely the product of President Clinton 's physical encounters with Monica Lewinsky and his subsequent denial of the relationship is patently absurd .If it were true that sex and lies were the real cause of this crisis , one would be forced to conclude that the American system of government was simply not viable .The genius of the \" Founding Fathers \" of the American republic would not amount to much if the functioning of the government depended on the willingness of presidents to tell the truth about their sex lives .The present crisis must arise from causes that are of a far more fundamental character .The conflict in Washington must , in the final analysis , reflect deep - rooted conflicts within American society as a whole .In no other advanced capitalist country is the spectrum of political debate as narrow as in the United States .According to the political establishment , there is no class struggle in the US .Indeed , official ideology denies the very existence of antagonistic social classes .But the denial of class conflict does not alter the fact that it exists .Precisely because there is virtually no avenue within the political system for the open and direct expression of class contradictions , they tend at first to manifest themselves in strange and even bizarre forms .The crisis in Washington arises from an interaction of complex political , social and economic processes .Bourgeois democracy is breaking down beneath the weight of accumulated and increasingly insoluble contradictions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.816067"}

Security Council .The State Department response stated : \" The Declaration ignores efforts to procure uranium from Niger .\" A month later , in your State of the Union address , you stated : \" The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa .\" Defense Secretary Rumsfeld subsequently cited the evidence in briefing reporters .It has now been conceded that this evidence was a forgery .On March 7 , the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed ElBaradei , reported that the evidence that Iraq sought nuclear materials from Niger was \" not authentic . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.21852"}

Paul , a Republican , said : .We are talking about people who are merely suspected of terrorism or suspected of committing a crime and have been judged by no court .We are talking about American citizens who could be taken from the United States and sent to a camp at Guantanamo Bay and held indefinitely .This should be alarming to everyone watching this proceeding today because it puts every single American citizen at risk .There is one thing and one thing only that is protecting American citizens , and that is our Constitution , the checks we put on government power ... . ... the detainee provisions of the Defense authorization bill do another grave harm to freedom .They imply perpetual war for the first time in the history of the United States .No benchmarks are established that would ever terminate the conflict with al - Qaida , the Taliban , or other foreign terrorist organizations .In fact , this bill explicitly says that no part of this bill is to imply any restriction on the authorization of force .When will the wars ever end ?When will these provisions end ?No congressional view is allowed or imagined .No victory is defined .No peace is possible if victory is made impossible by definition .That brings us to a final thought .One bizarre thing about this bill is that its grant of authority could and probably should be interpreted as fleeting : Everything in it is pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force that Congress passed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .Very few of those people are still at large in the world .It is only because we act as though the Authorization for Use of Military Force confers permission to fight a general , unending , ill - defined \" War on Terrorism \" that any of this matters at all .Merely acknowledging that the post - Sept .-11 declaration of war is all but spent would render the present bill largely meaningless .As we 've seen , however , the Senate is debating the new bill with the presumption that the 2001 AUMF will go on justifying military action abroad and at home against foreign and domestic enemies alike for many years on end .Or as they put it , indefinitely .This is one more reminder of the factual shakiness of the legal foundation for the War on Terror , and the fact that in practice we just ignore the legal problems .UPDATE : To be clear , a detainee held under this provision could claim the right to habeus review by the courts .And they might grant that limited right .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.409473"}

McRaven , the commander of the Special Operations Command ( SOCOM ) , is pressing for a larger role for his elite units and more personal autonomy to position his forces in troubled areas .McRaven , who oversaw the operation that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011 , wants to deploy 12,000 special forces around the world at all times to strike terrorist targets and rescue hostages .The Command has doubled in size since 2001 , currently at a level of 66,000 military and civilian personnel , and its budget has more than doubled , from $ 4.2 billion to $ 10.5 billion .Greater authority for SOCOM would reduce the influence of the State Department in dealing with difficult political situations as well as the authority of the Pentagon 's regional commanders .The heightened secrecy would complicate the problem of congressional oversight .Exaggeration of the threat has been a critical component in the militarization of national security policy .Such exaggeration fostered the huge strategic buildup during the Cold War , the unprecedented peacetime buildup by the Reagan administration , and massive increases in defense spending during the Bush II administration .In an effort to assure their own self - preservation , according to Harvard professor Daniel Yergin , nations often \" push the subjective boundaries of security outward to more and more areas , to encompass more and more geography and more and more problems .\" This often leads to a paradox - an expanded perception of threat rather than a greater sense of security .The United States has created such an environment .We now view each example of terrorist activity as an existential threat , and we are in the process of exaggerating the threat of China .The global war on terror is the latest example of the use of unilateral and hegemonic power , described by British theorist Edmund Burke in the eighteenth century .Burke was concerned with the British exercise of such power .The sovereign state came fully into its own in the seventeenth century , signaled by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 , which ended Europe 's religious wars and saw the final breakup of a universally Catholic Europe .No longer were territories ruled by multiple jurisdictions of empire , nationality , fiefdom , church , and holy orders , united by common language and common religion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.440765"}
{"text": "In the face of a dangerous North Korea , however , the most important question will not be whether the U.S. is technically capable of conducting any necessary military operations but whether it has the political will to do so .Successful deterrence requires the target to perceive the threat of retaliation as credible .So long as North Korea perceives a credibility gap in either Japan 's capability to respond to an attack on its own or in American willingness to undertake that burden , it will face an open invitation to attack a close American friend and potentially undermine a crucial alliance .The most useful step at this point for solidifying political will is to invest in the strength of the alliances with Japan and South Korea ; indeed , it may well be necessary to redefine their roles in the Asian security system .The U.S. and Japan require what may be called a combined strike capability - a notional division of roles and missions between the two countries that would allow them to respond collaboratively to an attack by North Korea .This is necessary because it would fill the credibility gap left by the requirement that Tokyo now ask Washington to retaliate on its behalf if it were struck by North Korea .The development of such a capability would require a number of steps , taken as mutual and supportive policy initiatives within the alliance .Japan already has several of these basic elements but does not have the training and doctrine to employ them in a single package - nor have the U.S. and Japan trained to employ a combined package .Either of these steps would help to make Japan a direct participant in its own self - defense and enhance the credibility of the deterrent posture of the U.S.-Japanese alliance .Sharing this capacity with Japan , even if it were not integrated into a complete Japanese strike capacity , would demonstrate the credibility of Japan 's self - defense and greatly enhance the combined capabilities of the U.S.-Japanese alliance .In this process , Japan must clarify the legal and policy restrictions that currently leave its Self Defense Law a riddle of restrictions in response to narrowly defined contingencies that may not comport to the reality of a North Korean attack .For example , it is not clear that Japan would be able to conduct a proportionate response to a North Korean attack , even though such a counterstrike clearly would be in keeping with Japan 's constitutional restrictions on self - defense .To make matters worse , the current interpretation of restrictions on collective self - defense may prohibit Japan from taking such basic measures as fueling American aircraft that are conducting an attack on the country 's behalf .These restrictions raise the specter of Japan as a burden rather than an ally .With regard to South Korea , several steps could help avoid a rupture of interests in the event of a North Korean regime destabilization .For example , the U.S. , Japan and South Korea should commence a trilateral security dialogue to address how the three countries view the possibility of a North Korean regime destabilization and how they would respond to the contingencies that may arise as a consequence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.47519"}

{"text": "JFK 's Second Term .Toward the end of his life John F. Kennedy increasingly distrusted his military advisers and was changing his views on foreign policy .A fresh look at the final months of his presidency suggests that a second Kennedy term might have produced not only an American withdrawal from Vietnam but also rapprochement with Fidel Castro 's Cuba .When Lyndon Johnson assumed the presidency , after the assassination of John F. Kennedy , in November of 1963 , he knew that in order to accrue political capital he would initially need to champion goals and policies that Kennedy had already been pursuing .On foreign policy , too , Johnson at first strove consciously to follow his predecessor .And some historians have argued that in this realm as well , LBJ indeed pursued a course that JFK had already plotted .If Kennedy had lived , according to this line of thinking , he would have continued a policy of antagonism toward Cuba and steady escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam .Johnson certainly believed that this was what Kennedy intended to do .From Atlantic Unbound : .Flashbacks : \" A Near Miss \" ( October 24 , 2002 ) Articles on the Cuban missile crisis by Walter Lippmann , Jerome B. Wiesner , and Sheldon M. Stern remind us how close we came to disaster .But what if it was n't ?Some Kennedy aides have always insisted that Johnson misread JFK 's plans for Vietnam .They say that Kennedy had begun to rethink the U.S. presence in Indochina , and was reluctant to increase it .Johnson 's defenders have tended to see this argument as wishful thinking by those who seek to exculpate JFK from what happened in Vietnam while laying all the blame on LBJ .The argument can never fully be put to rest .But newly available documents , along with a reappraisal of the existing record - especially of Kennedy 's concern about press reports from Saigon - suggest that Kennedy 's aides are correct : what Kennedy envisioned for U.S. policy in Vietnam was substantially different from what Johnson thought it was .Perhaps more surprising - given that at the time of Kennedy 's death the Cuban Missile Crisis was not long past , and that the CIA was still plotting to kill Fidel Castro - JFK appears to have been moving toward the idea of accommodation with Cuba .A consideration of likely post-1963 Kennedy policies must begin with JFK 's views on how political and military leaders make decisions about armed action .Why England Slept , his Harvard senior thesis , which was published as a book in 1940 , showed a healthy skepticism regarding the astuteness of both political and military officials in assessing foreign threats .He also doubted the effectiveness of a purely military approach to many political problems , especially in light of what he observed during his extensive travels to Europe , the Middle East , and Asia in the late 1930s and after World War II .And his own military experience as a young man had convinced him that military chiefs were not necessarily the best judges of when and how to fight a war .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.31802"}

{"text": "Why Did China Normalize Relations With The United States in 1972 ?Introduction .In February of 1972 , President Richard Nixon and Premiere Mao Tse - tung shocked the world announcing the formation of a normalized relationship between the People 's Republic of China and the United States of America .Forged during a week - long visit by the American President to Peking , this relationship broke new ground for both nations .Following the communist takeover , diplomatic channels between the People 's Republic of China and the United States came to an abrupt halt .During this period of Chinese isolationism , the United States actively expanded its sphere of influence in the Pacific attempting to reopen China , thwart the spread of communism , and boost its economy .When the seemingly impossible invitation arrived for an American visit into China , nobody expected its outcome to change the face of Sino - American relations so drastically .Political experts around the globe scratched their heads attempting to ascertain China 's motive for altering their foreign policy so suddenly .Even today , the rationale behind China 's decision to normalize their relations with the United States still begs for an answer .Applying balance of threat theory to decaying Sino - Soviet relations offers an immediate solution to the puzzle .A more detailed solution can be found after applying hegemonic stability theory across the span of several decades .An introduction to China 's historical background and a description of these theories is necessary before delving into their application to China 's changing foreign policy with America .China normalized relations with the United States as a means of enhancing national security and hastening progress towards resuming their role as the dominant power in the Pacific .Historic Chinese Foreign Policy .A state 's historical experience is perhaps the most important factor in understanding a its motivations for making policy .The Chinese have the distinct privilege of being the oldest continuous civilization still in existence today . 1Although its people date back to the Neolithic age , the origins of Chinese civilization is commonly associated with the Shang Dynasty in 1500 B.C. 2 Even more important than its longevity is the fact that the Chinese people themselves were isolated in their region .Topographic isolation provided by an ocean , mountain ranges , and barren wasteland kept the Chinese culture homogeneous and focused .Despite invasions by the Mongols and Japanese pirates , external intervention into Chinese culture are mere spots in the multiple millennia of China 's history .This isolation resulted in the Chinese people developing a magnified perception of self - righteousness in the world .Sinocentrism , as it is often called , refers to the Chinese belief that China is the undisputed center of civilization .3 This view of superiority was quite evident on the rare occasions when the Chinese did interact with external states .Foreign emissaries were forced to regard their admittance into China as a privilege .All diplomatic relations were executed in this fashion until the late nineteenth century .After the British broke into China 's economic system by introducing Opium , China was forced against its political will into international politics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.508945"}

Zakharov to Korea to advise Kim Il - sung to halt his offensive around the Pusan perimeter and to redeploy his forces to defend Seoul .Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans .As the overall commander of Chinese forces , Zhou Enlai suggested that the North Koreans should attempt to eliminate the enemy forces at Inchon only if they had reserves of at least 100,000 men ; otherwise , he advised the North Koreans to withdraw their forces north .On 25 September , Seoul was recaptured by South Korean forces .American air raids caused heavy damage to the KPA , destroying most of its tanks and much of its artillery .North Korean troops in the south , instead of effectively withdrawing north , rapidly disintegrated , leaving Pyongyang vulnerable .During the general retreat only 25,000 to 30,000 soldiers managed to rejoin the Northern KPA lines .On 27 September , Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo , in which he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat .UN forces cross partition line ( September - October 1950 ) .See main article : UN Offensive , 1950 .On 30 September , Defense Secretary George Marshall sent an eyes - only message to MacArthur : \" We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.13989"}

'No retreat , ' they have said .Free men will never bow to force and abandon their future to tyranny .That must be our answer , too , here at home .Our answer here at home , in every home , must be : No retreat from the responsibilities of the hour of the day .\" It is inconceivable that Johnson 's assertive , \" no retreat \" views about the war would have swung so immediately , and so dramatically , upon hearing the opinion of a television news anchor .An opinion that was hardly exceptional , novel , or shocking in late February 1968 .By the time of Cronkite 's report , \" stalemate \" had become an unremarkable - and not uncommon - way to characterize the war in Vietnam .The Times , for example , had invoked \" stalemate \" months before Cronkite 's television report , notably in a front - page news analysis published August 7 , 1967 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.0556"}

Murrow against McCarthy ; Cronkite during the Vietnam War , or the Washington Post reporters forcing the resignation of Richard Nixon - that 's when reporters challenge those who are in power .And Ben Bradlee , the Post 's executive editor during Watergate , said on \" Meet the Press \" in 1997 that \" it must be remembered that Nixon got Nix on .The Post did n't get Nixon .Bradlee was referring to the White House audio tapes which Nixon secretly made and which revealed the president 's guilty role in seeking to thwart the FBI 's investigation into the break - in of Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington in June 1972 .The break - in touched off the scandal - and the country 's gravest political crisis of the 20th century .How the Post and its reporters uncovered Watergate is deeply ingrained in American journalism as one of the field 's most important and self - reverential stories .But it is a simplistic and decidedly misleading interpretation , one that minimizes the more powerful and decisive forces that unraveled the scandal and ended Nixon 's corrupt presidency .\" Even then , Nixon likely would have served out his term if not for the audiotape recordings he secretly made of most conversations in the Oval Office of the White House .\" But as I discussed in my media- mythbusting book , Getting It Wrong , Johnson did not see Cronkite 's program when it aired on February 27 , 1968 ; he was at a black - tie birthday party in Texas for Governor John Connally .Nor is there evidence the president watched Cronkite 's report on videotape at some later date .So it 's hard to imagine how the president could have been much moved by a TV program he did not see .I further noted in Getting It Wrong that by 1968 , \" stalemate \" was hardly a novel or shocking way to characterize the Vietnam War . \" Stalemate \" had circulated in the news media months before Cronkite 's report .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.298134"}

Kennedy , and in some ways of Ronald Reagan . \"Thus , instead of breaking from the imperial consensus or the policies of Bush 's second term , Obama adopted them .This should not come as a surprise , since his inaugural staff included Bush personnel like defense secretary Bob Gates and General David Petraeus , as well as Democratic Party hawks like Hillary Clinton and Joseph Biden .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.7247"}

{"text": "It maintained a trade imbalance for three decades to modernize itself at the expense of the hegemon .During this period , it obtained the ability to back its political will via military force projection .China successfully displaced the United States as the local Pacific hegemon in the span of thirty years .Arguments can be made against both balance of threat and hegemonic stability theories as reasons for normalized relations with the United States .A border dispute over barren land could have been settled through compromise .This would conflict with thousands of years of Chinese resentment toward invasion .China 's enormous and improving army could easily have countered the Soviet Union by the 1980 's .Although equal in size , China still lacked the nuclear deterrence of mutually assured destruction .Balance of threat was clearly a significant factor in the Chinese decision .Applying hegemonic stability theory requires a higher level of abstraction .It is possible that China 's recent admittance into the World Trade Organization can be viewed as relaxation of a tight command economy .Given its history for relative decision making , China still stands to reap greater benefits than other nations involved .China 's military force projection is often criticized as weak and archaic .Despite its aging hardware , the state continues to acquire modern technology via illicit means , boasts the largest ground force in the world , and has surrounding states worried about imperialism .China obviously realized the situation when the United States prescribed to Kindleberger 's global economic theory and took full advantage of its loopholes .Conclusion .Normalizing relations with the United States in 1972 was not a diplomatic gesture of good faith by the Chinese .Instead , it was a calculated decision to ensure China 's territorial integrity from Soviet invasion and to exploit America 's economy .China successfully countered a Soviet threat by hiding beneath the nuclear umbrella of the United States .Although balance of threat explains the immediate nature for establishing the Shanghai Communique , hegemonic stability theory best explains the long - term nature of Sino - American politics .The modernization process experienced dramatic acceleration from free riding on America 's open market policies .Careful concessions slowly doled out over time resulted in political recognition , enormous exports , global resources , and technology information .Today , the People 's Republic of China 's intentions and goals for the new millennium remain unclear .Relations with the Chinese are complex and can not be taken at face value .In both historic and contemporary affairs , China 's leadership interacts with foreign states on a basis of privilege and need only .Resources and Trade - Primary Reasons for War and Military Expansion .The wealth of the ancient city - states of Venice and Genoa was based on their powerful navies , and treaties with other great powers to control trade .This evolved into nations designing their trade policies to intercept the wealth of others ( mercantilism ) .Occasionally one powerful country would overwhelm another through interception of its wealth though a trade war , covert war , or hot war ; but the weaker , less developed countries usually lose in these exchanges .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.82531"}

Bush ) was roundly denounced in the early 1990s .The Wolfowitz Defense Planning Guidance document stated that the United States ' first objective should be to \" prevent the re - emergence of a new rival .\" It went on to assert that it must \" establish and protect a new order \" and that potential competitors should be convinced that \" they need not aspire to a greater role or pursue a more aggressive posture to protect their legitimate interests . \" In short , a pax Americana should be established on the military , political , and economic fronts .Even advanced industrialized nations would be discouraged from seeking to \" overturn the [ United States ' ] established political and economic order .\" It followed from this that the United States would act alone if it needed to , in a unilateral manner , with no questions asked .This , the report stated , would guarantee world stability in a way that neither the United Nations nor any other multilateral coalitions could .At the time , these ideas were critiqued harshly by the then realist - led policy establishment ; the report was a political embarrassment for the elder Bush .Sen. Joe Biden , who went on to become vice - President of United States , called it a prescription for \" literally a Pax Americana , \" an American empire .Sen.

Scripps and the Business of Newspapers .So , too , did Louis Pizzitola in Hearst Over Hollywood .Donald A. Ritchie included the excerpt in American Journalists : Getting the Story , as did both George Sullivan in Journalists at Risk : Reporting America 's Wars and Samantha Barbas in her biography about Hearst gossip columnist Louella Parsons .Michael Schudson included the full quotation in Discovering the News , and cited as his source W.A. Swanberg , who excerpted a few passages from the Journal 's first - anniversary editorial in Citizen Hearst , a notably dreadful biography .The first - anniversary editorial , which carried the headline \" One Year 's Progress , \" was unsigned ; so it may not have been Hearst 's writing at all ( but in that case , he surely would have approved its content before publication ) .What 's more important is that the editorial was no endorsement of news - as - entertainment , no embrace of the primacy of superficial and trivial content .To describe it as such is to misrepresent and err : Hearst , or whoever wrote the editorial , was not extolling frivolity in his newspapers .Far from it .The editorial staked a claim to seriousness of purpose .It did not diminish the importance of news and newsgathering but rather embraced those aims , as these excerpts make clear ( my additional commentary is italicized ) : . \" The Journal has made it its business to reach out for news wherever it is to be had , considering neither precedent , difficulty , nor cost . \"Indeed , a little - recognized hallmark of Hearst 's journalism of the mid- and late-1890s was his willingness to devote substantial sums to cover far - flung news events .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.05698"}

W. Bush declared a \" New World Order \" no one knew what this meant .The collapse of the Soviet bloc had been so sudden that the U.S. ruling class and the foreign policy elites were unsure of how to proceed .During the first Gulf War the U.S. elites were split .Some believed that the U.S. should go on and invade Iraq , as the Wall Street Journal advised at the time .Others thought that an invasion and occupation of Iraq was not then feasible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.99749"}

Bill Haslam and Sen. Bob Corker would be facing jail time in a more just society .Their highhanded actions are certainly abuses of power not unlike those of Gov.

Corker about the future product lines from VW seem to be outright lies .He claimed that a vote for the union would result in new models going to other plants and suggested that his information came from top VW management sources , though he did n't identify his sources .Corker 's claims were denied by company spokespersons .It appears these lies and threats worked on just enough workers to defeat the unionization vote .However , if the media had fully explored the situation and explained the tactics , the outcome might have been very different .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.763855"}

Bush dodged wartime service in Vietnam .( Because it stars Robert Redford in Rather 's role , Truth has invited comparisons - not all of them favorable - to All the President 's Men , the 1976 film in which Redford played Woodward of the Post . )The WTOP reviewer has little truck with the Truth story line , saying it \" would have been far better ... to paint the characters as fallen figures who admit they screwed up , rather than misunderstood scapegoats who were taken down by The Man .Fair enough .But then , to demonstrate how assiduous journalists ought to proceed , the review reaches for the heroic - journalist trope of Watergate and declares : .\" If Woodward and Bernstein ran the story too early - before they had actual proof from reliable sources - Nixon would have stayed in office , the Watergate would simply be a fancy hotel , and ' All the President 's Men ' would not exist .The reference to \" the story \" is puzzling , given that the reporting of Watergate went far beyond a single article in the Washington Post .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.32683"}

{"text": "Further , the system is polarized at every level into center and periphery .From its beginning in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , and even more so in the monopoly stage , capital within each nation - state at the center of the system is driven by a need to control access to raw materials and labor in the periphery .In the monopoly stage of capitalism , moreover , nation - states and their corporations strive to keep as much of the world economy as possible open to their own investments , though not necessarily to those of their competitors .This competition over spheres of accumulation creates a scramble for control of various parts of the periphery , the most famous example of which was the scramble for Africa in the late nineteenth century in which all of the Western European powers of the day took part .Imperialism , however , continued to evolve beyond this classic phase , which ended with the Second World War and subsequent decolonization movement , and in the 1950s and 1960s a later phase presented its own historically specific characteristics .The most important of these was the United States replacing British hegemony over the capitalist world economy .The other was the existence of the Soviet Union , creating space for revolutionary movements in the third world , and helping to bring the leading capitalist powers into a Cold War military alliance reinforcing U.S. hegemony .In Magdoff 's conception , the existence of U.S. hegemony did not bring to an end the competition between capitalist states .Hegemony was always understood by realistic analysts as historically transitory , despite the constant references to the \" American century .\" The uneven development of capitalism meant continual interimperialist rivalry , even if somewhat hidden at times . \" Antagonism between unevenly developing industrial centers , \" he wrote , \" is the hub of the imperialist wheel \" ( p. 16 ) .U.S. militarism , which in this analysis went hand in hand with its imperial role , was not simply or even mainly a product of the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union , by which it was conditioned .Militarism had deeper roots in the need of the United States , as the hegemonic power of the capitalist world economy , to keep the doors open for foreign investment by resorting to force , if necessary .At the same time , the United States was employing its power where possible to advance the needs of its own corporations - as for example in Latin America where its dominance was unquestioned by other great powers .Not only did the United States exercise this military role on numerous occasions throughout the periphery in the post - Second World War period , but during that period it was also able to justify this as part of the fight against Communism .Militarism , associated with this role as global hegemon and alliance - leader , came to permeate all aspects of accumulation in the United States , so that the term industrial complex , \" introduced by Eisenhower in his departing speech as president , was an understatement .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.90374"}
