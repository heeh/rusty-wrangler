{"text": "However , this is probably a significant underrepresentation of the total universe of sex - trafficked children in the United States , as these cases are far more likely to be handled locally .The agencies that are more likely to encounter higher numbers of victims - state and local law enforcement and social service agencies - engage in inconsistent data collection and reporting .The best reporting on state sex - trafficking cases comes from the federally funded human - trafficking task forces that operate in 42 jurisdictions around the country .These task forces , created by the 2008 reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act , or TVPA , reported 1,407 suspected cases of sex trafficking of minors between January 2007 and June 2010 .Other jurisdictions sporadically report on sex - trafficking cases involving minors .The Alameda County District Attorney 's Office in California , for example , identified 267 cases of sex trafficking of minors from January 2011 to December 2012 .A 2013 study by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found that four counties reported more than 100 cases of child sex trafficking , and an additional nine counties each reported between 26 and 100 cases .Congress has attempted to address this vacuum of comprehensive data about human trafficking in the United States by including data collection requirements in the 2008 and 2013 reauthorizations of the TVPA .But significant challenges to collecting these data remain .First , many state and local law enforcement agencies have not received adequate training about the sex trafficking of minors and how to identify these cases .As discussed in the next section , many in law enforcement across the country have been slow to recognize that sex - trafficked teenagers are victims of a serious crime rather than voluntary participants in a consensual sex trade .This lack of training means that many trafficking cases go unrecognized and unreported .The same is true of social service and child welfare agencies : A lack of training means that trafficked and at - risk youth may go unrecognized as victims by service providers and child welfare advocates .Second , even when local authorities have been trained and are on the lookout for these cases , the hidden and underground nature of this crime means that cases often fail to catch the attention of law enforcement .A third , significant barrier to comprehensive data collection on sex - trafficked minors in the United States is that victims often do not identify themselves as such .While one might expect more self - reporting by young people - particularly in the form of requests for assistance to social service agencies and organizations - former victims often report that during the time they were being trafficked , they did not consider themselves to be victims of sex trafficking .Rather , they often viewed their exploitation at the hands of traffickers as an extension of the abuse they endured for years in the foster care system or as a necessary means of survival in the absence of support from family or community .Additionally , many young people 's hesitance to perceive themselves as victims may be part of their response to the trauma of their experience or a means of self - empowerment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.404133"}

{"text": "Certainly , these challenges in data collection are not insurmountable .But until we have comprehensive data about the sex trafficking of minors in this country , it will remain a significant challenge to craft appropriate legislative , policy , and law enforcement responses to address this issue .Reframing the issue .Lawmakers in every state and in Congress recognize that human trafficking is a serious crime and have enacted laws criminalizing this conduct and imposing serious penalties on traffickers .Forty - three states have also enacted laws that specifically address the sex trafficking of minors .Since these laws were enacted , many jurisdictions have increasingly begun to target traffickers for prosecution .As mentioned above , the FBI has successfully rescued more than 2,700 children from sex trafficking through the Innocence Lost National Initiative since its founding in 2003 .Investigations resulting from these operations led to the conviction of more than 1,300 traffickers who exploited children across the country .Likewise , a number of local prosecutors have begun to aggressively prosecute child sex - trafficking cases .Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette , for example , launched that office 's first Human Trafficking Unit in July 2011 and is currently prosecuting a number of cases that involve minors under Michigan 's recently strengthened trafficking law .The Alameda County District Attorney 's Office launched a public relations campaign to combat child sex trafficking and obtained convictions of 109 defendants in human sex - trafficking cases between January 2006 and 2010 , the majority of which involved the exploitation of minors .While law enforcement agencies across the country have made significant advancements in targeting and prosecuting traffickers , many jurisdictions have fallen far behind in terms of how they perceive and treat the underage victims of this crime .Moreover , juvenile prostitution continues to fall under the jurisdiction of juvenile courts in many states , channeling child victims of commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking into the juvenile justice system to be punished for their victimization .And often , their abuser is waiting on the other side to put them right back to \" work .\" The movement to recognize human trafficking as a serious criminal enterprise that threatens public safety is therefore only partially complete .While states should be applauded for recognizing trafficking as a crime and working diligently to prosecute the traffickers , this addresses only one side of this issue .Providing appropriate and compassionate support and services to the victims is perhaps equally or even more important than stopping the traffickers .Young people who are the victims of sex trafficking - many of whom are already vulnerable to abuse and exploitation , as discussed in the next section - must be treated by law enforcement unequivocally as victims of crime , not as perpetrators of their own vice or quality - of - life offenses .We would never assign blame or culpability to a child - abuse or rape victim in another context , so why do we continue to do so in the context of commercial sexual exploitation ?Fortunately , there is a growing movement among states to change the conventional thinking about underage victims of trafficking and how they should be treated by the criminal justice system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.9836"}

Adams , of Warwick , Rhode Island , was just recently convicted in the 2012 murder of 20-year - old Backpage prostitute Mary Grier .Adams is said to have used Backpage to try to rob one woman he ordered off of Backpage after pistol - whipping her .That victim was able to escape .Mary Grier was not so lucky .Only two weeks after the assault of his previous victim Adams led Ms. Grier into a garage where he murdered her .Forensic reports say that she had ligature marks and around her neck and that the cause of death was homicidal violence .Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin had the following to say about Backpage 's responsibility in all of this ... .28-year - old Daniel Tejeda , of Providence , Rhode Island , was recently indicted on first - degree murder charges for the death of 24-year - old Ashley Masi .Masi was found unresponsive back in March by police doing a welfare check on her .Police discovered that Ms. Masi was working as a prostitute on Backpage .Investigators say that Tejada responded to her Backpage ad and somewhere along the line allegedly strangled her to death .Unfortunately Ms. Masi left behind three young children who are now in state care .Tejada is already in jail on unrelated charges .19-year - old Reginald Chaney was arrested in Providence , Rhode Island , for allegedly prostituting two underage girls on Backpage .Chaney allegedly turned out the girls , ages 15 and 16 , from January 16th to the 28th around Rhode Island and Massachusetts .He 's also accused of tasering one of the girls to get her to comply .Again , I have to question just how effective Backpage 's laughable screening process is when some 19-year - old kid can manage to get underage girls on their website .I still ca n't stress this enough that as a parent you need to not only know which apps your kids are using but who 's on their friends list .Even a tiny device like a smart phone can leave a huge open widow to your kids .Even with the use of sarcasm quotes I wish the media would refrain from referring to female pimps and traffickers as madams .It makes them seem less responsible for their crimes than their male counterparts .Not only that but the phrase madam conjures up images of Miss Kitty from Gunsmoke , Dolly Parton from The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas or some equally fictionalized romanticism of madams .As I 've said before female sex traffickers can be just as vicious if not more so with their victims .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.10812"}

Craigslist in concluding this is irrelevant .Backpage takes steps to increase its revenues .Backpage allegedly \" tout[ed ] its website as a ' highly tuned marketing site ' and instruct[ed ] posters of ads on how to best increase the impact of those ads . \" The court responds : \" to find Backpage to be not immune from suit based on M.A. 's allegations about how it structured its website in order to increase its profits would be to create a for - profit exception to \u00a7 230 's broad grant of immunity .This the Court may not do . \"Backpage allegedly knew prostitution was advertised on the site .The court cites several cases for the proposition that knowledge is irrelevant to 230 's immunity .It 's nice to see , yet again , a court recognize that liability should be properly applied , and we should n't blame 3rd party service providers for the actions of their users .from the big - help dept .When Craigslist -- under a peer pressure campaign from grandstanding state attorneys general and some misguided activists groups -- shut down its adult services section , it was n't difficult to predict that this would do little to nothing to actually slow down or prevent prostitution .Instead , it would just drive those activities to other sites , and those sites might not work quite as closely with law enforcement as Craigslist did .In fact , we noted that Craigslist was a very useful tool for law enforcement to actually track down and crack prostitution rings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.14664"}

{"text": "Those efforts have been ramping up , and every day I seem to get press releases from some ridiculous group that is apparently coordinating this misguided and dangerous attack .It appears that some of the silly publicity stunt is working , with Senators Richard Blumenthal , Mark Kirk , John Cornyn , Sheldon Whitehouse and Marco Rubio all supporting a \" resolution \" demanding Backpage take down its \" adult entertainment \" section .We 've seen this battle before .Craigslist went through the same ridiculous moral panic a few years ago .And all it did was drive all of this traffic elsewhere -- with a lot of it settling on Backpage .Of course , that effort was led by then Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal , before he became a Senator -- so it 's no surprise that he 's involved in this pointeless effort as well .Here 's the thing : we already know how this game plays out .You can browbeat these companies into shutting off this part of their forums against their own will , and many of them will cave .And you 'll celebrate victory , but as you do that , everyone will be rapidly exploring alternatives , which most will move to pretty quickly .In other words , such a crackdown wo n't do a damn thing to stop people from actually being exploited .Even worse , in pressuring that content to scatter , it becomes much more difficult for law enforcement to track down and arrest the real criminals who are abusing the system .But nothing in getting Backpage to turn off this section actually helps to stop such trafficking / prostitution .It just makes life that much more difficult for law enforcement , since they now need to do a lot more work to track down the people abusing these laws .I fail to see how that 's a positive result , as the government has insisted .from the we - could - have - told - you - that dept .Last year , we wrote about a former child prostitute who sued Village Voice Media for its Backpage classified ads offerings , since this was a tool previously used to sell her .Now there has been a lot of controversy in the last couple of years ( mainly from grandstanding politicians ) about prostitution ads on Craigslist and Backpage .However , as has been pointed out over and over and over again , the liability belongs on the person actually committing the crime , not the service provider .And , in fact , the law , via Section 230 of the CDA gives service providers immunity .Still , we were a little worried that since this case was highly emotionally charged , and involved a child prostitute , that the court might make a bad ruling .Instead , it appears that court has made a really strong and useful ruling explaining repeatedly why Backpage is not liable .The girl 's lawyers basically tried every trick in the book to get around Section 230 immunity , but the court debunked each and every one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.82349"}
