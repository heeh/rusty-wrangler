Paez , \" have in common with a Maya - speaking recent immigrant from Guatemala ?\" They could have easily added that a white , third - generation , upper crust Cuban has virtually nothing in common with the newly arrived Guatemalan .Being Latino makes no difference .This is not mere speculation countless studies and surveys have documented broad patterns of discrimination by white Cubans against dark skinned Cubans and blacks in Miami .Though far too many government officials in Latin American countries still downplay , or deny that color discrimination exists in their countries , the harsh fact is that those of African ancestry in Latin American countries wallow at the bottom of the social and economic ladder .This is a strong indictment of the color prejudice against blacks and dark - skinned Indians in Mexico and Latin America .Yet , the Census simply lumped all those from Spanish - speaking countries into the catchall category of \" Latino \" and made no national or regional distinction between Latinos from various Latin American countries .This generic labeling of those who hail from Spanish speaking countries and native - born Latinos insured that Latinos would surpass blacks in population numbers in America .It also obscures the profound differences in the motive that drives many Spanish - speaking immigrants to this country .It is n't always the eternal search , or maybe even stereotypical , and facile view that says Latino immigrants regard America as their ticket out of poverty and destitution in their own countries .The 3 million El Salvadoran immigrants and 1.5 million Guatemalan immigrants in the United States in 2004 fled their countries during and after the 1980s to escape the civil wars , death squads , and harsh military quasi - fascist regimes that claimed thousands of lives in those countries . \"Many Salvadoran immigrants were already political activists and refugees , notes Randy Ertll , a second generation El Salvadoran in Los Angeles and director of el centro de accion a social service agency in Pasadena , California .\" They knew how to mobilize people and many established their own community organizations .\" The organizations he mentioned are el rescate , Central American Resource Center , and clinica romero .The groups have provided services to blacks as well as El Salvadoran and other Central American immigrants .This made a difference in how many blacks have related to El Salvadorans and Guatemalans in Los Angeles .When Los Angeles Police Swat officers stormed a business during a hostage standoff in South L.A. in July 2005 , and killed three - year - old Suzie Pena , the daughter of El Salvadoran immigrants , blacks held candle light vigils and demonstrations against the police killing .In Los Angeles , the tens of thousands of Guatemalan and El Salvadoran refuges and immigrants in addition have not as yet been as vocal or visible in pushing demands for greater political power , more El Salvadoran teachers and administrators in the schools , or public sector jobs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.289215"}
{"text": "I think we 're almost there . \" As party chair , Berlon 's optimism is probably just a function of his job .Still , a casual observer of politics might find this strange .After all , in all but two of the last eight presidential elections , Georgia has voted for the Republican candidate .Eight of its 13 congressional districts are controlled by Republicans ( they control all but one of the state 's majority - white districts ) , and both of its Republican senators were elected by margins of 15 points or more .These numbers are mirrored across the Deep South .Indeed , historians may view the 2010 midterm elections as a landmark in the half - century - long political transformation of the region .For the first time since the end of Reconstruction , Republicans control a majority of legislatures in the states of the former confederacy .In North Carolina , which last saw a GOP - led General Assembly during the McKinley administration , Republicans gained a 16-seat majority in the House and a 10-seat majority in the Senate .Likewise , in Alabama , Republicans won near supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature , ending 136 consecutive years of Democratic control .To the extent that this is a realignment of state and local Southern politics , it is thoroughly racial .White Southerners have finally lost their tolerance for white Democrats .Before last year 's elections , there were seven white representatives from the Deep South ( Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Georgia , and South Carolina ) in the congressional Democratic caucus .Today , there 's one ( from Georgia ) .The Democratic Party that remains after this white exodus is smaller , weaker , and blacker than it has ever been .Indeed , based on state exit polls from the 2000 election , African Americans account for a large majority of Democrats in the Deep South , a historically unprecedented phenomenon .As local parties become darker , whites are less likely to remain .What 's more , those whites have become far more conservative than in years past , to the point where Southern Republicans are especially conservative and Southern Democrats are especially liberal ( and mostly African American ) .In the 110th Congress , for example , the American Conservative Union gave Georgia 's Republican delegation an average rating of 96.07 .On the opposite end , the liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave Georgia 's Democratic delegation an average rating of 75 , not as intensely liberal as the conservatives were conservative but different enough from the Republicans to suggest they come from different planets .So if , as Berlon contends , the Democratic Party in the South has a bright future , it wo n't resemble any Southern Democratic Party we 've seen before .By and large , it will be mostly black and brown .Press Berlon about his optimism , and he immediately turns the conversation to demographics . \"Georgia had a pretty significant increase in the population , over 18 percent , \" he explains , pointing specifically to the decline in the number of whites and the increase in the number of Hispanics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.29388"}
