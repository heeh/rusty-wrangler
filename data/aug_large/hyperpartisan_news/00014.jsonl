{"text": "Average High Cost Multiple ( AHCM ) .The AHCM is a widely used metric of Unemployment Insurance ( UI ) fund solvency which measures the number of years a UI fund could pay benefits at recessionary levels without additional UI employer contributions .The U.S. Department of Labor has concluded that an AHCM equal to 1.0-whereby a state would be able to pay one year of historically high benefits without additional revenue - represents a minimum acceptable level of solvency .Evidence from the most recent recession ( December 2007 to June 2009 ) provides some support for this conclusion .Immediately prior to the recession , six states had an AHCM of 1.0 or greater .Of these , only one had to obtain a loan from the federal government as a result of the recession .Overall , 32 states had to obtain federal loans .The average AHCM of states that received a federal loan was 0.39 , as compared to 0.83 for states that did not receive a federal loan .Calculation of AHCM .The AHCM is calculated in three steps : .Calculate what is known as a reserve ratio .A reserve ratio is calculated by dividing the balance of the state 's UI fund by the total wages paid to covered employees in the preceding twelve months .Calculate what is known as an average high cost rate .This calculation proceeds in two steps : ( 1 ) for each of the preceding 20 calendar years , the amount of benefits paid is divided by the total wages paid to covered employees and ( 2 ) the highest three values are averaged .Divide the reserve ratio by the average high cost rate .By comparing the reserve ratio and the average high cost rate , the AHCM reports the duration for which current fund balances could cover benefit costs if they were at historically high levels .AHCM of 1.0 a Historically High Target for California .As shown on the nearby graph , California 's UI fund solvency has been trending downward significantly over the past 20 years .The state has not achieved an AHCM of at least 1.0 since 1990 .Since full implementation of the state 's most recent statutory increase in UI benefits ( passed in 2001 ) , the state 's AHCM has not exceeded 0.32 .Proposed Block Grant .When the federal government extends unemployment benefits beyond the state - authorized 26 weeks , it generally pays for most , if not all , of the benefit costs .Currently , unemployed Californians may receive up to 99 weeks of benefits , with the final 73 weeks funded by the federal government .The proposed JOBS act replaces the funding now used for extended benefits with federal block grants and relieves states of the obligation to provide extended benefits .The block grants could be used for ( 1 ) continued payment of extended benefits if a state elected to provide them , ( 2 ) payment of regular UI benefits , ( 3 ) repayment of federal UI loans , and ( 4 ) reemployment services .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.012375"}
{"text": "We believe such an approach offers a reasonable trade - off between the impacts of increased employment costs and reduced assistance for unemployed workers .Below , we outline one such solvency plan .Description of the Plan .Under our proposed approach , employer contributions would be increased in an identical manner to the President 's proposal .The taxable wage base would be increased from $ 7,000 to $ 15,000 and indexed to the average annual wage in subsequent years .Our approach would go further than the President 's by taking three actions to reduce UI benefit levels .Similar to the taxable wage base , the maximum weekly benefit amount would be indexed to the average annual wage in subsequent years .We note that , due to indexing , the maximum weekly benefit amount would be expected to return to around $ 450 within five years .The Major Impacts of the Plan .As mentioned above , if our approach were implemented in 2014 , it would likely result in the elimination of the UI fund deficit by 2016 and the establishment of a significant UI fund reserve by 2018 .This would be accomplished by increasing employer contributions by a total of about $ 11 billion and decreasing benefit payments by a total of about $ 4 billion during the period 2014 to 2018 , as compared to current law .Consequently , the average employer contribution per employee would increase by roughly 60 percent during this period , while the average weekly benefit paid to UI claimants would decrease by about 12 percent .Under this approach , state interest costs would be reduced by $ 1.3 billion .Overall , this approach is intended to return California 's UI fund to solvency in a timely manner while balancing the impacts of increased employment costs and reduced assistance for unemployed workers .Acknowledgments This report was prepared by Brian Uhler and reviewed by Todd Bland .The Legislative Analyst 's Office ( LAO ) is a nonpartisan office which provides fiscal and policy information and advice to the Legislature .The same rationale applies to the withholding of city income taxes under the similar City Code provisions .Proofs of claim by the United States and New York City with respect to the withholding taxes on the priority wage claims are not required .The federal and city withholding taxes are entitled , as are the priority wage claims from which they emerge , to second priority of payment under \u00a7 64a(2 ) of the Bankruptcy Act .Such taxes are not within the fourth priority under \u00a7 64a(4 ) , since they did not become due and owing by the bankrupt until after the wage claims were paid following bankruptcy .Nor are such taxes entitled to first priority under \u00a7 64a(1 ) , since they are not costs or expenses of administration of the bankrupt estate , but are part of the wage claims themselves and are carved out of the payment of those claims .The arrangement failed , and on August 30 , 1965 , Freedomland was adjudicated a bankrupt .Petitioner , William Otte , was appointed and qualified as the trustee .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.59122"}
