{"text": "Smith explains that genocide is a logic that upholds colonialism ; the narrative and illusion that native peoples have simply disappeared from this land affords rightful claim to all non - indigenous groups .And , orientialism , directed at immigrants of color no matter how long they have been in the U.S. , is used to justify the constant state of war to protect itself from enemies .Smith argues that even members of oppressed groups can become complicit in the oppression of other groups by embracing these logics .In many ways , Ben Carson 's complicity in vilifying Muslims functions as strategic use of one of the logics of white supremacy .As a racial \" other \" seeking our nation 's highest political office , Ben Carson must prove his commitment to maintaining the status quo through maintaining each of the pillars in order to be considered as a serious and viable candidate .To many white voters , his blackness serves to legitimate racist claims against Muslims as it does with criticisms of his own racial group .Ultimately , Carson 's Orientalist rhetoric makes him an especially seductive candidate for perpetuating white America 's commitment to colorblind ideology .In other words , for a white person looking to publicly prove their racial indifference despite their internal racist attitudes , a Black candidate spewing Islamophobic hatred is an especially enticing option at the polls .When it comes talking about race , most white people know that the acceptable stance is to be \" race neutral \" - say the wrong thing , and you might be labeled a \" racist \" - the scarlet letter of our so - called \" post racial \" society .Our collective failure is that most people have a limited understanding of what racism actually is , and do not see Carson 's Islamophobia as racism .It seems that Orientalism , and in this case Islamophobia as a specific manifestation of Orientalism , has joined traditional white racism as a publicly acceptable way to manifest bigotry .But displacement in the form of overt Islamophobia does nothing to help heal the very real wounds of our country 's continuing legacy of racialized oppression , as it too is racism .Instead , displacement of racial angst serves to strengthen the very phenomenon it wishes to evade .We must also consider the implications of the 29 % of Americans who , well into Obama 's second term , still maintain that he is a Muslim - even after significant proof has been provided that he is in fact a practicing Christian .While it is taboo in our colorblind society to claim that one has a problem with Obama as President because of the color of his skin , re - configuring him as a Muslim is a convenient way to protest his position in power without seeming \" racist . \" In this way , it is possible to use the racist logic of Orientalism to avoid being perceived as an overt racist complicit in the hierarchical positioning of whites as superior to every other race .Carson may also be using this rhetoric as a tactic to strategically distance himself from President Obama and appeal to voters who will inevitably find a way to conflate the two Black men , despite their dramatically different political attitudes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.34504"}

Bush .This would be to miss the entire point of what Paul is saying .Bush is simply an acute and prominent example serving to illuminate the deep and insidious nature of the collective mental disorder afflicting our species .This is not your typical Bush - bashing book .Though it seems to be about Bush , it is really about ourselves .Paul identifies and elucidates the structure and dynamics of the collective trance from which humanity needs to wake up from so that we may stop dreaming up nightmares for ourselves .We , as a species , have been suffering from a pervasive form of mis - knowledge about the nature of the universe , and ourselves as well .We keep trying solutions that are premised on a view of reality that is false , which ensure that our attempts at resolution will never succeed .One of the implicit and generally unrecognized problems underlying our world crisis is that we tend to be entranced by fixating our attention on a superficial level of explicate ( outer manifest forms ) and seemingly separate patterns that make up our world .By having our awareness constricted and focused in such a limited way , we are not seeing , attending to or feeling the deeper , undivided , invisible , and indivisible field and its non - local dynamics which are responsible for shaping world events in a fundamental way .These non - local forces are the formative agents of the patterns of outer events and are only to be discovered in one place within our own subjective experience , that is , within our minds .There has been a critically important breakthrough in physics in the last few decades that has radically changed our understanding of the nature of Nature .What has been discovered is that an underlying assumption -- known as \" the principle of locality\"--implicit in our scientific understanding of the physical world for centuries , is categorically wrong at the deepest level of nature .Locality refers to a tacit or unconscious assumption about the nature of physical reality .It is the view , arising from our day to day experiencing of the macroscopic physical world , that the world is comprised of apparently separate things or mechanistically interacting parts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.23596"}

Garcia notes in his book on Latino Politics .While we also share important common denominators such as the experience of discrimination and lack of inclusion in the U.S. as Feagin and Cobas describe , these subgroup differences are large enough to generate diverse policy interests or at the least differences in strategy .So , it should come as no surprise that there are issues where there is dissent between Latino groups and that is only going to become more frequent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.78757"}

'Rose immediately corrected him , saying he meant that Israel preferred a POLITICAL victory over a military victory .Gillerman responded by saying \" yes , a political victory over a military victory , \" as if that 's exactly what he had said .He had no idea that he had mis - spoken , and that his Freudian slip may have unwittingly revealed a deeper process that was playing out through his , and by extension , Israel 's unconscious .A Freudian slip is the voice of the unconscious .In his slip of the tongue , Gillerman unknowingly may have revealed what is going on inside the unconscious , whose intentions are the polar opposite of what he imagines or represents them to be ( both to himself and to the world ) at that moment .In his Freudian slip , Gillerman may have been unwittingly revealing what he was unconsciously dissociated from and hiding from himself , and hence , unconsciously enacting in the world .When we are not in conscious relationship with a part of ourselves , we are doomed to unconsciously give shape and form to it by acting it out in the world .Once I began contemplating the ambassador 's Freudian slip , I wondered what it could have been revealing about his ( and Israel 's ) unconscious .If that was the voice of the unconscious , it is expressing the shadow , the darker part , of what Israel is playing out on the global stage .If it was a genuine Freudian slip , Gillerman is unknowingly revealing that Israel prefers a victory by force over anything negotiated via diplomacy .It is as if this voice that wanted a military victory was thirsting to assert its power and domination over its enemies .It goes without saying that this is the absolute polar opposite of the representatives of peace that Gillerman and Israel like to think of themselves as being .This unconscious dark side that the Israeli ambassador is revealing is none other than the underlying , un - integrated collective shadow of his nation which is being brutally acted out on the world stage .Gillerman 's Freudian slip seems to be revealing an urge on the part of Israel for revenge , an impulse to want to punish their adversaries .Wanting to destroy the \" other , \" Israel is unconsciously acting out the part of itself that has been abused .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.169716"}

{"text": "A broader definition of the phenomenon was suggested by Sigal G. Barsade- \" a process in which a person or group influences the emotions or behavior of another person or group through the conscious or unconscious induction of emotion states and behavioral attitudes \" .Social contagion is imitative behavior based on the power of suggestion and imitative influence .Social contagion operates on four levels - emotional , behavioral , ideational , and hysterical - and depending on which level appears to be predominant , psychologists categorize social contagion accordingly : .But is that really all there is to it ?Do we err fundamentally by ascribing \" psychological \" rather than \" physiological \" causes to these modalities of contagious mass behaviour ?Where exactly does agency reside within our composite organism ?What again , is the optimal unit of selection driving individual and \" species \" behaviour ?I 'm not convinced that the people launching these racial slurs necessarily harbor any feelings of racial superiority , and I 'm therefore very nervous about the idea of pursuing extraordinary punitive measures against them .But I have begun to think that this anxiety may stem from some confusion about what constitutes \" racism \" , and what the purpose of hate crimes legislation is supposed to be .As some of the other commenters have noted , it might be interesting for DeAngelo to ask himself whether his reaction would have been so much different had the driver presented as a member of some group other than \" Latino \" .Had it been an overweight white lady with an Indigo Girls bumper sticker , might he not have thought angry things about fat dykes ?Had it been a black dude blasting hip - hop from his black SUV , might he not have thought angry things about gangsta thugs ?And so on .UBM points out that we all harbor anger and fear toward the Other , but I think even that statement simplifies what 's going on here .When we are angry with someone for any reason , however petty or reasonable , we reach for weapons with which we can 1 ) make the person feel bad , and 2 ) distance ourselves psychologically from the person .Dehumanizing the object of our anger , and defining the person as Other -- as someone outside your tribe -- fulfills a number of psychological aims .It makes it easier to fight the person without hesitation if that becomes neessary .It helps to rally support for you and against your opponent from those defined as members of your tribe .And so on .My point , I guess , is this : .In - group / out - group psychology is universal .It 's a primate thing , and it was really useful when we were first coming out of the trees .It can be a little more problematic these days .Our culture provides templates for us to create this Other ; it gives us the tools we need to build our own racist caricatures at those moments we decide we want one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.190735"}

Kennedy to involve the private bar in providing legal services to address racial discrimination .The principal mission of the Lawyers ' Committee is to secure , through the rule of law , equal justice under law , particularly in the areas of fair housing and fair lending , community development , employment ; voting ; education and environmental justice .Since that time , their initial faith in Senator Kennedy has been richly rewarded many times over .With his unmatched passion for justice and vision of boundless opportunity for every American , Senator Kennedy devoted his extraordinary legislative skills to bringing real , lasting and beneficial change to our nation .He made America a better and more hopeful place .Active and engaged nearly to the end of his extraordinary life and career , his loss will be deeply felt by all who continue to dream of America 's promise fulfilled .We will miss him , and at this sad moment we convey our deepest condolences to the Kennedy family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.91858"}

Kennedy stood for many of the same rights that we fight for daily - equality , education , employment , and healthcare .Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Kennedy family .By Terry O'Neill , The National Organization for Women ( NOW )The National Organization for Women is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Senator Edward Kennedy , the revered Democrat from Massachusetts .A dedicated public servant , Ted Kennedy was a champion of civil rights , women 's equality , voting rights , economic justice , disability rights , reproductive freedom and so much more .We lost a true legislative hero in Ted Kennedy -- a defender of women , children and all those who are discriminated against and underserved in this country .We have Kennedy to thank for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the 1965 Voting Rights Act , the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act .He was a great leader in the fight for health care reform , and I only hope that we can honor him by passing real reform designed to benefit the people -- not insurance CEOs .Kennedy was committed to creating a level playing field for all , especially those who traditionally have been denied access to the American dream .He will be an extremely hard act to follow .NOW calls on Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and state officials to follow Kennedy 's wishes and take the necessary action to allow for the senator 's seat to be filled until a special election can take place .We urge that this replacement be a strong supporter of the broad range of social justice issues that Kennedy advocated for throughout the last half century .By June O'Neill .The nation has lost the ' lion of the Senate ' and a champion for those who are marginalized and disenfranchised in our country .Senator Kennedy was an American icon and a hero to millions who admired his strength , grace , intellect and conviction .In 1980 I had the privilege of being elected a Ted Kennedy delegate to the Democratic National Convention held that year in Madison Square Garden .It was a memorable night when he gave one of the best and most moving speeches of his career .He pledged then to fight for Americans who are unemployed and for national health care insurance .Last year , as a delegate to the National Convention in Denver , I was among the thousands who were in the hall to see and hear Senator Kennedy deliver what would become his final major public address .There was n't a dry eye in the house when he finished .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.40756"}

BUSH :A REFLECTION OF OUR COLLECTIVE PSYCHOSIS by Paul Levy .In this ground - breaking work , Paul Levy explores whether the madness that George W. Bush has fallen into is showing us something particularly important about ourselves .What if Bush 's madness is a reflection of our own potential for madness ?What if Bush has been collectively dreamed up to play out , in full - bodied form , a pathological role existing deep within the collective unconscious of all humanity ?Though this book centers on George Bush , it is ultimately about ourselves .In The Madness of George W. Bush : A Reflection of Our Collective Psychosis , Levy analyzes the current state of our world as if it is a mass shared dream all 6.4 billion of us are collaboratively dreaming up into materialization .Drawing heavily on the insights of the great doctor of the soul , C. G. Jung , Levy identifies the root process being dreamed up on the world stage is a collective psychosis he calls \" malignant egophrenia . \"He illumines how this disease of the psyche expresses itself non - locally ( not bound by space or time ) throughout the underlying unified field that connects us all , propagating itself through the unconscious blind spots of the collective .He points out that if the malignant egophrenia epidemic manifesting in our world continues to go unrecognized , it will result in endless suffering and self - destruction .Levy proposes that this collective madness is simultaneously revealing to us our potential for an evolutionary quantum leap in human consciousness .He concludes that whether we destroy ourselves as a species or wake up depends on enough of us recognizing what the insanity of our current world crisis is revealing to us .The choice , and responsibility , is truly ours .This book is an invaluable contribution to creating the change of hearts and minds that is the pathway to true evolution . \" -Catherine Austin Fitts , Former Assistant Secretary of Housing ( Bush 1 ) .\" The Jungian analysis by Paul Levy , of Bush and the culture which maintains him , reaches deep into the American psyche .It should be studied and digested by everyone .If the citizenry would recognize that Bush 's egomania is acting out a national illness , we would all be saner .If the US could integrate the \" shadow \" which Bush projects upon the \" the axis of evil , \" perhaps we could achieve world peace and start to solve global problems .A MUST READ . \"-Carol S.

{"text": "\" [ Emphasis in original ] When we become inflated by an archetype , there is a synchronistic correlation between the inner experience of being identified with the archetype and outer events .The inner state of being possessed by the archetype expresses itself by arranging external events so as to give shape and form to itself .A person inflated by an archetype , such as Bush , literally becomes the channel through which transpersonal , mythic forces become materialized into our third - dimension , which just reinforces his inflation in a diabolical feedback loop .By identifying with the archetype , Bush becomes seized by the archetype 's irresistible field of force and unwittingly becomes the agent who does the archetype 's bidding .By being so taken over by an impersonal force , Bush has become a \" magnet \" which torques the field around him so as to insatiably feed his own pathology , while simultaneously wreaking havoc on the field .Taken over by the archetype 's magnetic power , Bush achieves a certain magnetism , which polarizes the field around it .Like a magnet , archetypes are bi - polar , having a negative and a positive aspect .On the one hand , the power of the archetype coming through Bush attracts people to support him in his delusion who are suggestible to the overwhelming unconscious power inherent in the archetype .In a co - dependent relationship , Bush 's followers feed his identification with the archetype , which simultaneously nourishes their own bewitchment , in a perverse , self - perpetuating feedback loop which develops an autonomous life of its own .At the same time , Bush 's identification with the archetype repels other people , who react against the one - sidedness and perversity of his inflation .By being so unconsciously identified with the archetype , Bush will literally attract to himself , like a lightning rod attracts lightning , other people 's negative , shadow projections .These people will strongly condemn Bush , and see him as being evil .And yet , people who react against Bush in this way are unwittingly feeding the polarization in the field , perpetuating the very diabolical energy they are reacting against .If we concretize Bush as being evil , we are projecting our own shadow onto him and are then guilty of the very evil of which we are accusing Bush .Interestingly , another inner meaning of the word Devil is \" the accuser .\" If we are accusing Bush of being evil , we are guilty of the very evil of which we are accusing Bush .Bush is merely an ignorant human being who , due to his unrestrained greed , desire , and lust for power is unwittingly allowing himself to be used as an instrument of evil .Evil itself is a power , or principality that transcends the merely human dimension , as it is archetypal in nature and thereby is a content belonging to the collective unconscious .Bush is simply a deluded human being who is dangerous because of his position of power , which allows him to act out his pathological process on the world stage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.41781"}

G. Jung himself went through a severe shamanic crisis , during which many of his colleagues thought he had gone insane .He wrote about his initiation in the chapter of his autobiography called \" Confrontation with the Unconscious , \" and he reminds us that the demonic is \" the not yet realized creative .\" The idea is that inherent in the demonic is a blessing , is our creative power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.56471"}
