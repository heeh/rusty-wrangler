Tuch , also of George Washington University , to examine the causation of negative perceptions of police in the Black community .The answers mirror what many of us have experienced : Black Americans are overwhelming faced with corruption , violence , and profiling more than any other racial or ethnic group : .Whites tend to hold a favorable opinion of the police , favor aggressive law enforcement , and are skeptical of criticisms of the police .There is a racial dimension to this orientation .Many Whites view Blacks as inclined to criminal or violent behavior ( Swigert and Farrell 1976 ; Weitzer 2000 ; cf .Hurwitz and Peffley 1997 ) .In response to a question in the 2000 General Social Survey , 48 percent of Whites think that Blacks are \" violence - prone .\" For many Whites , controlling crime is roughly equivalent to intensifying law enforcement against minority individuals or in minority communities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.92856"}

Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) addressed the crowd .As that rally ended , some protesters moved around to the south side of the Capitol , near the entrance to the House chamber , and across the east front of the complex .On the first day of spring , most lawmakers walked across the street from their office buildings to the Capitol , rather than using the underground tunnels .That brought them into contact with protesters forming a gauntlet on each side of the walkway leading into the House .At one point , when Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer ( D - Md . ) wanted to walk across the street to an office building , he was ushered into a car by his security detail and driven a couple hundred feet through the screaming crowd .Saturday evening , more than a handful of House Republicans held an impromptu rally on the Capitol steps .Using a megaphone , the lawmakers urged on the crowd .Shortly after 6 p.m. , Rep. Ted Poe ( R - Tex . ) dared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) to come out onto the House steps and address the more than 1,000 people who were gathered at the foot of the Capitol , prompting a loud and angry chant of \" Nancy , Nancy , Nancy .\" The protesters believe that the Obama administration and Congress are ignoring the public 's opposition to the $ 940 billion legislation , which they consider it to be a government takeover of the health - care system .They carried signs saying \" Remember in November \" ; one carried a broomstick with cardboard pasted onto it with the label \" Here 's Your Ride , \" for Pelosi .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.10634"}
