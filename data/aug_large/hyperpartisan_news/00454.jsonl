Slobodzian , INQUIRER STAFF WRITER .Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams is known as an avid user of the Facebook social media site .But he has some complaints and on Monday Williams used his public pulpit to take that gripe right to the top : Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg .Williams called on Zuckerberg to show he is a \" good corporate citizen \" by ordering Facebook to remove the page of a Philadelphia man Williams alleges used it to solicit the killing of a witness in a criminal case involving illegal firearm purchases .So far , Facebook - if not Zuckerberg personally - has said no because Freddie Henriquez ' page urging people to \" kill rats \" does not violate any of Facebook 's terms of use .\" I asked to be District Attorney . . .Victims did n't ask to have their car stolen , did n't ask to be raped or shot , \" Williams told reporters .Williams said sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking him to order Henriquez ' page removed and his Facebook account deactivated : \" I hope that he will be a good corporate citizen that will do all that he can to help us protect victims and witnesses . \"In an e - mail , a Facebook spokesman did not directly address Williams'statements at the new conference .\" Facebook works with law enforcement to the extent required by law and where appropriate to ensure the safety of Facebook users , \" the statement reads .\" We work very hard to be a good partner to law enforcement and any assertion to the contrary is false .\" Williams said Assistant District Attorney Andrew B. Wellbrock made numerous requests to Facebook about the Henriquez Facebook page .Wellbrock received e - mails from Facebook 's Law Enforcement Response Team on Jan. 8 and Jan. 15 saying the images did not violate Facebook policy .Williams , however , said Henriquez ' Facebook page violated two points of its \" Statement of Rights and Responsibilities .\" Williams said item No . 6 reads , \" You will not bully , intimidate , or harass any user , \" and item No . 10 reads , \" You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful , misleading , or discriminatory . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.70811"}

{"text": "Amy is the least violent person I 've ever met .With some of the wild slanderous speculation that has been going on in some of the posts here in recent days , I 'm surprised that my comment is demanding such exacting evidence .I am making my comment based upon what I am seeing on the clip itself .I never stated it as a known fact .If you read it that way , it was not my intent .I happen to believe that Amy is a pretty smart cookie , who has been around the block a few times in covering protests or being a participant ( as is her right ) .She is likely very knowledgeable about how interactions with police are handled .Especially a setting which is a very chaotic situation occurring of peaceful protesters with significant numbers of outright anarchists mixed within , who are destroying property and taking selective advantage of numbers to also assault officers ( surely you 've seen the news videos yesterday ) .The police are in a heighten state of action and are going to be especially limited in tolerating disobedience , whether verbal or physical .Since you may have a personal empathy for Amy through her work , you may never be able to view this incident involving her through the eyes of those trying to control a dangerous situation going on around them .I explained above how , during this particular emergency situation that the police were dealing with , Amy seemed insistent that her requests for information be honored immediately , as the officer was repeatedly asking her to move back away from a particular police line .While he was then physically trying to move her away from the police line she was continuing to lean into him and resist being moved back .As I said , she is no doubt a smart person and is familiar with how these interactions work .I have no idea why she would do this since you would have to think that she would fully understand what the final result was likely to be .I can appreciate her concern for her co - workers .Maybe she felt if she could n't get an answer she 'd just as soon be arrested along with them .But to believe that she was oblivious to the idea that she might be arrested as a result of her actions is actually giving her LESS credit for street smarts than I am giving her .And I do n't know who was filming this at such close range .A colleague ?But I would suppose that both Amy and the police officers knew that the exchange was being videoed , which may have played into both of their reactions .I ca n't speak to all the arrests that happened throughout the day .I can only suggest what I am seeing from the limited clip and the knowledge of the types of conflict and violence that was going on yesterday .I would think that soon ( if not already ) the charges initially leveled on her and her co - workers will be dropped , if events happened as Amy says .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.72102"}
