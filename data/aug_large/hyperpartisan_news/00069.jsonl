Melson .Acting Director .Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives .99 New York Avenue , NE .Washington , DC 20226 .Dear Acting Director Melson : .On March 4 , 2011 , I wrote you regarding questions surrounding the February 15 murder of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) Agent Jaime Zapata in Mexico .I have yet to receive a reply .In my last letter , I referenced the March 1 DOJ press release regarding the Osorio brothers and their next - door neighbor Kelvin Morrison .They were arrested on charges related to trafficking firearms to a Mexican drug cartel and indicted on March 23 .According to the release , all three defendants had been suspects in an ATF undercover operation in early November 2010 .In that operation , the Osorio brothers and Morrison provided 40 firearms to an ATF informant .The press release indicates , \" The meeting [ between the informant and the suspected traffickers ] was arranged related to an investigation of Los Zetas , \" a Mexican drug trafficking cartel .[ 1 ] .The DOJ 's press release appears to be the first public acknowledgement that one of the firearms used in the murder of Agent Zapata had been traced back to Otilio Osorio .Specifically , the press release stated : . [ A]ccording to one affidavit filed in the case , one of the three firearms used in the Feb. 15 , 2011 , deadly assault of ICE Special Agent Jaime Zapata that was seized by Mexican officials has been traced by ATF to Otilio Osorio .Otilio Osorio allegedly purchased that firearm on Oct. 10 , 2010 , in the Dallas / Fort Worth metroplex , prior to law enforcement 's awareness of the purchase .Ballistic testing conducted by Mexican authorities on this firearm indicated it was one of the three firearms used during the deadly assault on Special Agent Zapata 's vehicle .[ 2 ] .The DOJ 's press release gives the impression that law enforcement officials were unaware of Osorio 's activities in October 2010 when he allegedly purchased the weapon that was later used to kill Agent Zapata .The press release leads the reader to believe that law enforcement had no reason to suspect Osorio was a straw purchaser until sometime between October 10 and early November , when he was the subject of the undercover operation .According to the release : .The investigation now has also revealed that on Aug. 7 , 2010 , a Romarm , model WASR , 7.62 caliber rifle was discovered by law enforcement officers in LaPryor , Texas , near the U.S./Mexico border .Trace results indicated that Morrison purchased this firearm on July 30 , 2010 , from a FFL [ federal firearms licensee].", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.03623"}

'In this story , a 22-year - old woman claimed on September 5 that she was abducted and raped by three Hispanic men .They forced her into a green pickup , she said , then took her to an open area nearby and raped her .She was hospitalized with injuries but disappeared before detectives could interview her further .Detectives soon discovered that the woman had used a fictitious name and address .After several days of searching , police found the woman a week later at a hotel and interviewed her again .Well , now she 's changed her story but still insists she 's a rape victim .Now the woman admits she was hanging out with one of the men and was raped by two other men .In addition , the woman 's previous description of her attackers ' clothes was inaccurate , police said .And after her most recent interview with police , the woman was arrested on outstanding misdemeanor warrants for larceny and damage to property in Charlotte .She also faces pending drug charges in South Carolina .After all that , the police are continuing their search for three hapless Hispanic men .And Deputy Chief David Graham even said this : \" We think something happened to her .It 's our duty to find out what .\" You see , it would be the height of political incorrectness for a police officer to say that \" we have grave doubts about her claim \" in light of her other falsehoods .Even though any person would common sense would think that .He must say , \" we think something happened , \" and be sure to note that \" it 's our duty \" to investigate it .And , no , dear readers , we do n't know for certain what happened to the young lady .She apparently suffered some sort of injury , somehow .But here is what we do know .We know for sure that she lied about one man 's guilt , at least .She originally said there were three rapists ; now she says that she was actually with one of the men and only two Hispanic men supposedly raped her .Suppose the police had actually arrested three men and charged them with rape ?At least one would have been wrongly charged , but hey , who 's counting ?It 's just men were talking about .Hispanic men , at that .We also know that she lied to the police about the clothing they were wearing .We also know that she lied to the police about her name and address .We also know there are larceny and drug charges pending against her .Despite all this , the radical feminist sexual assault community would tell us that we must assume this woman was raped .Seriously .That is what they would tell us .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.9722"}
{"text": "As discussed above , the ATF 's National Response Plan in effect in 1993 led to the placement of Chojnacki as incident commander and Sarabyn as technical commander for the raid , when more experienced ATF personnel were available .Likewise , the subcommittees recommend that other senior positions in significant operations , such as tactical commander , also be selected by ATF headquarters personnel from ATF agents most experienced in these areas , regardless of geographical assignment .Senior officials at ATF headquarters should assert greater command and control over significant operations .Just as the National Response Plan should be revised to allow greater control by ATF headquarters , the subcommittees recommend that ATF 's most senior officials be personally involved in the planning and oversight of every significant operation .While the ATF did activate its National Command Center in Washington just prior to the commencement of the ATF raid against the Davidians , command center personnel played no actual role in the planning or the implementation of the operation until after it went awry .The subcommittees recommend that ATF 's most senior officials be directly involved in the planning of all significant operations and personally approve each operation in advance of its implementation .The ATF should be constrained from independently investigating drug - related crimes .He stated that on several prior occasions , when police had placed the ambulance company on standby , the station sent a camera crew to the site of the police activity , even though the police had not disclosed it to the station . 7 ( 1995 ) [ hereinafter Hearings Part 2].[ See documents produced to the subcommittees by the Department of the Treasury T005368 , T005376 at Appendix [ hereinafter Treasury Documents].The Appendix is published separately . ]J.L. & Soc .Probs .The Appendix is separately published .Did any of the ATF agents tell you that there had been shots fired from the helicopters ?Mr. Byrnes : Quite to the contrary , we could find no evidence that there was ever any shots fired .Our best evidence is that they peeled off at about 300 , 350 meters , because there was gunfire , and those pilots were not going to fly over that residence .Hearings Part 2 at 197 .All I could tell you is they come from the sky downward .If somebody were standing on top of the roof shooting down into the ceiling , it would look exactly the same way .\" Hearings Part 2 at 27 ( statement of Jack Zimmerman ) .Treasury Documents T00012743-T00013735 .the Treasury , Case No .

{"text": "One of the reasons suspicious person calls are so dangerous is because there normally is n't much information and the danger signs are usually quite vague .While there may be enough information to cause concern , there is seldom enough to be sure about the risks , leaving us ambiguous about how to approach the situation and leading to decisions which may put us at greater risk than originally anticipated .In this case , the officers understandably choose to approach Garcia in a low profile manner .In retrospect , it becomes clear that he should have been taken down at gunpoint .When assessing the risks of a suspicious person call , remember most people are reluctant to call the police .They do n't want to bother law enforcement if it looks like their fears are unwarranted .Therefore , they often wait until they are reasonably certain that something is wrong before they call .In addition , most citizens are intimately familiar with the businesses , people and circumstances in their neighborhoods , and have a good idea about what is suspicious and what is not .Because of these factors , we should always take suspicious persons calls seriously .The safest approach is to assume there was a good reason for the call and know that we may be walking into a dangerous situation .Similarly , suspicious persons and circumstances that you observe on your own should be considered potentially dangerous .If they catch your attention , there is probably a good reason for it .Even if you ca n't put your finger on what aroused your suspicious , you must assume that your instincts are correct .What we call gut instinct comes from subtle clues perceived only at the subconscious level , and communicated to our conscious mind as a feeling .We may not know why , but we know something is wrong .Rather than ignore the feeling , or try to explain it away , we should use it as a trigger to raise our awareness and prepare us to take action .When responding to a suspicious person call , remember appearances may be deceiving and we may have very little information to go on .We must slow down , assess the situation thoroughly , plan our actions carefully and approach with caution .Tactics Another reason suspicious person calls are difficult to handle is because although the risks are significant , high - risk tactics may not be justified .Unless we detect something that makes it obvious that danger is present , we have to use low - profile tactics .So many variables are involved in these calls , making it difficult to develop universal procedures to apply to every situation .Still , there are basic principles that apply to most , like slowing down , gathering as much intelligence as possible before making contact , keeping your guard up , using backup and when possible , ordering the subject to come to you .Beyond that , we must remain flexible and open minded about our options so we can quickly adapt to the situation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.609344"}

{"text": "The process rests on a sad irony .Many years ago feminists decided strong , independent liberated women do not need to be protected by men .Not by their fathers , not by their brothers , not by their husbands .As a matter of fact , a gentleman who offered a small courteous gestures of respect was routinely denounced by feminists as a gross insult .He was treating a woman as a member of the weaker sex .If a man opened a door for a woman , he was called a sexist for assuming that the woman could not open the door herself .The feminist message was clear : modern women can take care of themselves .Well , not exactly .Since men are predators , prone to abuse and molest strong , independent women , these women need an extra level of protection : they need to have an extra - judicial procedure that can inflict serious punishment on any male who would see fit to ill - treat them .No one needs to worry that women might abuse the privilege by bringing unfounded charges against certain men .No , it ca n't happen .Women always tell the truth .Apparently , the problem of violence against women is so bad that the criminal justice system can not deal with it .It is so out - of - control that the civil justice system can not do the job .That 's the real problem : feminism .When you have a group of feminists who set out to destroy the traditional gender roles of men , and who criminalize the traditional virtues of men , then you should NOT be surprised that government has to grow to fill the void .They told women that chastity was out , and chivalry was out .Traditional male roles of protector , provider , and moral / spiritual leader are out .What kind of men do women choose if they want to avoid all of those traditional male virtues ?Bad men .And when bad men are n't doing what the feminists want , they resort to big government to coerce and punish them .Every other man looking on to this situation is going to be reinforced not to pursue relationships with women , out of fear that they could be hit with false accusations for upsetting her - even if he has n't done anything at all !Eventually , men will just opt out of all contact with women in order to have their freedom to say and do what they feel like .I will look forward to the day when feminists spent the last 40 years of their lives alone in their apartments , talking to their cats .What man in his right mind would want anything to do with these nutcases and their weird ideology ?Page views since 1/30/09 .RSS feed .Archives .Other New Nation News pages Aboriginal news American Worker Betrayed ATM rape murders Bias lawsuits Black on White crime Bloody Wichita Black reparations Black sports Books and Western Civilization Burned Alive !
