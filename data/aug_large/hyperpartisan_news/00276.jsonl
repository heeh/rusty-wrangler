{"text": "I 'm just now seeing this series of posts , and first of all , I want to commend you for stepping back and listening .I 've been really lucky , in my time on the blogosphere , that I 've mostly encountered wonderful parents who , despite the challenges their children face on a daily basis , are willing to listen to those of us who face them too .That does n't mean we 're always right , and it does n't mean our experiences will be your child 's experiences .But it does mean that we are all willing to listen and consider others ' experiences .I read a large number of special needs parenting blogs , about kids with an extremely wide range of abilities and disabilities , because I want to understand why people do and say what they do .But I also wanted to share something that I was thinking when I read through all of the posts you linked to above .I live my life by thinking and believing \" assume good intentions \" .It 's a great rule .I try to assume that someone who has said something that triggered me or was offensive to me , was not said from a place of hate .Dialogue is great , but it has to come from a place of kindness .Sure , it can come from a place of offense ( otherwise it never really starts ) , but really , it 's got to be from a place of good .Quite often , in many different activist communities ( the LGBT community , which I used to be involved with in particular ) always assume bad intentions .Too often we see or hear something that does n't fit our \" idea of a perfect world \" and we pounce .That is as non - productive as the defensive that we put you on when we do pounce .I grew up in an environment where my parents \" hated Autism \" - everything that I did that could be related to my autistic traits , I was abused for .They did n't hit me for reading , in fact , it was encouraged .They would yell , hit , and confiscate my books if I began to read extensively and obsessively on a subject .So I grew up in a reality where my parents truly hated my autism .And it 's a very scary place to be .But I do not assume that everyone else lives that reality .In fact , if you keep a public online blog , to me , the assumption is that you care about your son so deeply , you will do anything to help him grow and develop to his full potential .And your reactions to him and his behaviors come from a place of love .Assume good intentions .- I try to open a dialogue , not a screaming match , because if I say or do something offensive ( which I have done , more often than I 'd like to admit ) , that is what I would want people to do for me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.066372"}
{"text": "More recently , in practice and in law , it has become very useful as a legal distinction , and that 's where I believe it 's current place is .My point was simply that words matter , but I probably used a poor example .I do n't agree with the word marriage being sacred , but mostly because keeping it sacred would hold back social progression .In this case , using and understanding the correct terminology is important to continuing social progression .In my experience with trans people , they 've largely written off any support from lesbians and gay men- they tend to see trans people as gender traitors , weird , confused etc .Society in general is n't that accepting of trans people either .As such , many trans people are n't trying to please the outsider world , they are in a very insular world with only trans people in it and mostly ignore outsiders .If outsiders are n't at all receptive to diplomacy it 's stressful and pointless trying to reach out to outsiders .Their message is \" do n't talk to me unless you like trans people .\" they are in a very insular world with only trans people in it and mostly ignore outsiders .Really ?Hmm .It does n't really seem that way to me .That 's a generalization that does n't seem based on reality .Their message is \" do n't talk to me unless you like trans people .\" That 's unsustainable .More like \" do n't talk to me if you if you actively dislike / disrespect trans people .\" Most trans people blend in to society , and for those people it 's not an issue .You may think every trans person here on reddit wears their trans status on their sleeve and therefore has conflicts with people who do n't like trans people .In real life , transphobes and trans people interact with each other without the issue coming up .That said , OP 's only example of \" arbitrary social roles or titles \" that \" derail conversations \" is misgendering a trans person .That 's about as complicated as learning someone 's name .I 'd love to hear another example of something his activist friends say that is a legit inconvenience .Possibly .I am pretty sure I have plenty of experience with this .Of the many trans people I know , very few of them isolate themselves away from the general public .Your statement that I quoted seems kind of negative and also does not represent the vast majority of people I know .I wonder how you came to that conclusion .I came to my conclusion that contradicts yours by knowing dozens of trans people personally , many more on the internet , and by being trans myself .My experience was heavily with politically active university students , often who were part way through a transition and thus who had difficulties blending in .The trans people you know may be from a different set of people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.13645"}
