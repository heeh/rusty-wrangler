Robert Kennedy until his assassination in 1968 .He then took a job with a law firm and moved to Cincinnati .Springer lost a race for Congress in 1970 , but a year later was elected to Cincinnati City Council .He resigned amid scandal in 1974 after he was discovered to have patronized a prostitute because he paid her by check .But voters later forgave his indiscretion , and reelected him to City Council , which tapped him to serve as mayor for a year when he was 33 .After losing a race for governor in 1982 , Springer became a television news anchor at a local NBC affiliate , where he won several local Emmys and brought the station to the tops of the ratings .His bosses at the time considered him to be an ideal replacement for the retiring Phil Donahue .At the time , Springer says , he was skeptical of the whole endeavor .\" My first contract was for six weeks , \" he says .\" I was just assigned it as as employee . \"His show has legions of detractors who accuse it of glorifying anti - social behavior .But the most common accusation against the The Jerry Springer Show is that it 's fake , everything from the guests to the fist fights to the shouts of \" Jerry , Jerry , Jerry . \"Springer , for his part , insists that the stories on the program are real . \" The behavior has existed since the beginning of time , \" Springer says , adding that \" maybe in the beginning \" the show got duped but no longer .\" Now , they sign statements in front of the camera saying what they are saying is true .\" Springer has not gotten politics out of his system .For a while , he hosted a talk show on the now - defunct politically liberal Air America radio network .When asked if he would ever run for office again , Springer replied \" never say never , \" but seemed to think it unlikely .Like many people , Springer expects the Democrats to lose big this November .Springer 's Still Going Strong .Success may be Springer 's best revenge against the naysayers .This fall , The Jerry Springer Show delivered its highest household ratings for a season premier week in three years .Ratings among women viewers were especially strong .The talk show host , though , is n't resting on his laurels -- or indeed , resting much at all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.30615"}

Moreno in the Huffington Post .Maurice .To reach the \" truth \" -- whatever that is -- you need to ask the right question .So , here 's my attempt at that : Somebody on this thread tell me : At what precise point , what moment , does the fertilized egg become not just life , but human life worthy of all rights due to all human beings ?And please provide your source for this information .Doug , from the point of view of what is or is not ethical in the decision of \" at what precise point , what moment , does the fertilized egg become not just life , but human life worthy of all rights due to all human beings ? \" one must consider another \" when \" .That \" when \" is at what stage of the developing fetus treating the fetus as a person with \" all the rights \" will NOT deny all accepted persons all the rights that every person deserves in life .If providing the fetus at an earlier stage \" all the rights \" simply denies the rights to any other acknowledged person than certainly it would be ethically unjust to give that fetus the title of \" a person with all the rights \" .A person given \" all rights \" can not ethically deny others their given rights just because that \" person \" has , at some point , been given \" rights \" .By ethical consensus we must find that point .For example , it is accepted by law and Catholic religion as an example , that if a clinical situation pits the life of the mother against the life of the fetus , the right of the mother to continue life trumps the continued existence of the fetus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.42825"}

{"text": "If the ruling declared that all native born persons are automatically U.S. citizens , then the clause requiring that they also be subject to U.S. jurisdiction would be meaninglessly unnecessary .But Amendments are n't written with such unnecessary excess baggage .Such words absolutely have real meaning , and not meeting the meaning of those words leaves a native - born person without constitutionally legitimate citizenship .Persons who do not meet the meaning of those words are those who were born to transient foreigners who were not able to return to their own country before giving birth .Those foreign parents were subject to the jurisdiction of their own country , the country of their citizenship , and not U.S. jurisdiction .They , unlike Americans , could not be ordered to be drafted , nor to register with the Selective Service , nor buy private health care insurance , ( but they could easily be ordered to be deported if they stayed beyond the limit of their visa ) .The other area of ambiguity of the 14th Amendment is due to the fact that no time frame is given .Babies are n't normally subject to any jurisdiction except that of their parents , so what applies to the parents also applies to their children .So by extension , the babies born to visitors are also not subject to U.S. jurisdiction .But ... what if after they grow up abroad , they return to the United States and seek to obtain permanent U.S. residency .They could then claim that they are thus fully subject to U.S. jurisdiction , and since they were born in the United States , they thereby fulfill the requirements of the 14th Amendment and do not need to be naturalized in order to become a citizen .Talk about ambiguity !If they were n't subject at birth but became so as adults , does the wording of the 14th Amendment intend that they be deemed to have been thereby transmuted into citizens ?It 's sloppy sentence construction , like that of the amendment , that results in such preventable complications .The wording of the 14th Amendment could have been made crystal clear if the authors had really thought through all the possible interpretations that their wording gave it .That would have covered all citizens , -the merely native - born as well as all natural born .Extrapolating the true meaning of the 14th Amendment results in the conclusion that Barack Obama is not a U.S. citizens by its intent since his father was not a foreign immigrant with permanent resident status , but was merely a foreign visitor here on a student visa .Therefore it does not matter that he was born in the United States .What matters is the status of his parents at the time of his birth .His father had no U.S. citizenship that he could inherit , he was n't subject to U.S. jurisdiction when his child was born , therefore the child 's citizenship was solely dependent on the status of his mother and not on the 14th Amendment .Since Obama 's mother was not yet 19 when he was born , he would not be a citizen automatically via his mother 's citizenship unless he was born within the United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.6134"}

{"text": "If Barack Obama was not born in the United States then he was not born as an American citizen .Such a possibility would explain why he has not shown the American public that which all Americans can show , which is a certified hard - copy birth certificate from an American hospital .Nor has he shown the public the copy of his birth certificate that his mother obtained for him in order to get a passport before moving to Indonesia .These facts imply a high probability that the hand - written statement in the Hawaiian vital records archive , which is all that the governor said could be found ( along with a typed form ) reveals something that may relate to the location of his birth .Whatever it is that it states is something he does not want the American people to know .And that could be that he was not born in the United States , but may have been born in Canada , which is close to Seattle where his mother is known to have been a mere two weeks after his birth .It is highly reasonable to speculate on the probability of a scenario in which she spent a week in Vancouver after giving birth there , possibly with the intent of giving the child of a foreign bigamist up for adoption .His mother lived in Seattle the year after his birth and went to college there where she had grown up from 13 years until graduation from High School .Her only connection to Hawaii was that her parents had up - rooted her for the 5th time and moved there after she completed High School .So conclusions can logically be drawn and they do n't support the narrative that everyone has been fed .The other Article II disqualifying circumstance of Obama 's birth is the fact that no one whose citizenship is defined in law is eligible to be the President because all such persons are not natural born citizens .The citizenship of natural born citizens is not established by any legislation , administrative ruling , Supreme Court ruling , nor by the Constitution itself .Natural born citizenship predates everything written regarding citizenship because everything written is written regarding children born to immigrants or domestically located representatives of foreign governments , or foreign visitors .There never has been a need to author any statement regarding natural citizenship anymore than there has ever been a need to establish a right of citizens to vote .The right to vote is also not found in the body of the Constitution because it also was viewed as an unalienable human right , as an understood fact embodied in the fundamental principles stated in the Declaration of Independence .The citizenship of natural born citizens is based on the political equivalent of Natural Law , i.e. , citizens give birth to citizens naturally .Hybrids , or hyphenated citizens , are not natural citizens , anymore that hybrids in nature are natural off - spring .This fact , ( political inheritance ) , has been the basis of citizenship being passed down to subsequent generations for thousands of years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.41358"}

{"text": "Maurice : I do n't claim to have all the answers -- but I 'm saying that under some legal contexts in our country a fetus is defined as a human being with rights .I 'm also saying our law seems confused on this issue , with no clear standard .I also suggesting that since there is no \" science \" to determine what constitutes human life , there is a valid argument that we lean toward giving a fetus the benefit of the doubt .The possible \" scientific \" definition of human life as some born into the world -- does n't seem logical to me .First , you have to define \" born .\" Do you mean natural birth ?A fetus can be taken from the womb at quite an early stage and survive .Indeed , a fetus can be conceived in a test tube .Is that being \" born ? \"Yes , the Supreme Court can create a definition .But that would not be primarily a scientific , nor a moral , nor even a philosophic or theological definition .It would be primarily a political definition .Are we then saying there is no objective definition of human life ?Various political systems ( like Nazi Germany ) can create their own laws that determine the definition of human life , what 's of value and what is n't ?Is there a \" Natural Law ?\" I 'm playing the Devil 's Advocate here .Your response ?It appears this topic has been pretty much decided by the few posters .I do understand the difficulty involved in ethical questions like this .I also understand that once it all becomes pretty much relative , i.e. the definition of what constitutes human life and what life gets that designation and what does n't -- once it becomes relative , history has shown us there is indeed a slippery slope .The American public did n't get to vote whether to free the slaves .Lincoln did it on his own .He claimed the moral high ground .Even during the civil rights era -- if you had taken a vote as to whether to outlaw segregation , how do you think it would have come out ?Was it a relatie question ?Should each state have been given the right to segregate ?Do n't forget the federal government had to send troops south to enforce the new civil rights laws .It is believed that this use constitutes a ' fair use ' of any such copyrighted material as provided for in section 107 of the US Copyright Law .If you wish to use copyrighted material from this site for purposes of your own that go beyond ' fair use ' , you must obtain permission from the copyright owner .The material in this site is provided for educational and informational purposes only , and is not intended to be a substitute for a health care provider 's consultation .Please consult your own appropriate health care provider about the applicability of any opinions or recommendations with respect to your own symptoms or medical conditions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "120.13313"}
