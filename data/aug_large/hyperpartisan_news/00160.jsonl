Brown .I think Brady thought they were standing and putting their hands on their hearts for him .A case of Obamaitis .Purple State .It 's pretty ironic that there 's so much policing of one 's behavior during a song that ends with \" the land of the free ... \" This story feels very \" Big Brother . \" Maria ODonnell .No Patriots here - shame on them when so many of our men and women are fighting overseas and at home to allow them to play this game .But what else is expected of someone of the caliber of Brady - Bridget Moynihan need not say more .Vikki .Ca n't believe there are some players who think they are too good to put their hand over their hearts during the National Anthem !Conservaguy .Brady and Billicheat are elitists .They feel they are above such things .Perkiset .This is beyond laughable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "120.78477"}
{"text": "That ' 01 Hurricanes team , which went undefeated and routed Nebraska in the BCS Championship Game , produced NFL players at just about every position .That Miami roster produced 17 first - round draft picks and 38 players were drafted into the NFL .Andre Johnson was on that roster .So was Vince Wilfork .So was D.J. Williams .So was Jonathan Vilma .So was Antrelle Rolle .So were Willis McGahee and Clinton Portis , who were both ahead of Gore on the depth chart .So was Sean Taylor , who was Reed 's backup and made the Pro Bowl twice before being tragically killed in a home invasion .And so was 2012 Pro Bowler Chris Myers , who did n't start at Miami but logged significant playing time as a backup because , in his matter - of - fact words , \" We were blowing teams out by 40 points . \"( That team 's average margin of victory was actually 32.9 points . )\" Every now and then you get to coach a great one , \" says Tampa Bay Bucs head coach Greg Schiano , who helped recruit that Miami team and coached Reed before leaving for Rutgers in 2000 .\" That team was littered with great ones .I do n't know that there will ever be a team assembled with all that talent again .\" The heft of the credit for the millennium Hurricanes ' success goes to Butch Davis , the head coach who assembled all that talent in one place before bolting to the NFL .\" Butch Davis was an incredible , incredible evaluator of talent , \" says then - assistant Curtis Johnson , who is now at Tulane .Davis ' legacy is mixed because of a two - pronged NCAA investigation at North Carolina that resulted in his firing , but in 10 years as a college head coach , he recruited dozens of future NFL players and more than 30 first - round draft picks .Most came at Miami .\" We were looking for athletic , speed guys who loved football , \" explains Schiano .That was a directive from Davis , who got his start coaching multiple sports and always looked for players who could excel at basketball , track , wrestling , whatever .\" When you coach a lot of different sports , \" Davis says , \" you start to appreciate a lot of skills and how they work together . \"He would assemble his staff in a film room , look at high school games , and wait for preps to \" jump off the screen .\"The recruiting ground in South Florida was fertile , but a lot of the stars on that 2001 roster came from elsewhere .Reed arrived from Louisiana .McKinnie came from New Jersey .Jeremy Shockey grew up in Oklahoma .Davis did n't much care for five - star guys as much as he wanted those three ingredients : athleticism , speed and love of football .For every Andre Johnson , who probably could have played in the NFL as a college freshman , there was an undersized talent nobody else saw . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.39108"}
