Hassan , who filed for divorce .But it is not only husbands and fathers who have authority over women under Sharia law .As Darwish states , a man who knows how to play the system in a Sharia state can rape and abuse females of almost any age without consequence .Furthermore , Darwish shows , the various forms of formal and informal polygamy practiced in Sharia states poisons the relationship between husband and wife and feeds jihad by limiting the marriage choices of low - income men .Sharia law only restricts women in their sexual activities ; men - those of means , at least - are allowed a \" wife buffet \" of sexual choices .And there is no prohibition in the Qur'an for men with authority over them to sexually exploit very young female children - though you 'll be relieved to know that Iran 's Ayatollah Khomeni wrote that penetration of an infant is not recommended .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.02437"}

{"text": "SUMMARY .So , all three main sources of Islam - the Quran , the Hadith , and the Sirat all support Muslim men , including Muhammad , having sex with female slaves .Also , both prior and present Islamic scholars also declare that Muslim men can have sex with female slaves .These verses from the Quran and Hadith prove that Muhammad allowed his men to do to female slaves what essentially amounts to as RAPE .No true prophet of God would willing allow this .The icing on the cake is that Muhammad claimed to receive \" revelations \" from Allah permitting this .One has to ask what kind of god Muhammad really worshipped .APPENDIX 1 : A MUSLIM 'S ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY THE RAPE BASED UPON DEUTERONOMY .A Muslim seeking to justify Muhammad 's evil actions implies that God allowed the rape of female slaves in the Old Testament .He asks the following question : . \"So what do you think the God of the Bible is telling you here ........ and since you believe Jesus to be God he is also telling you this : \" [ Deut 21:10 - 14 ] .And it shall be , if thou have no delight in her , then thou shalt let her go whither she will ; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money , thou shalt not make merchandise of her , because thou hast humbled her .Here is the same passage from the NIV .DT 21:10 When you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives , 11 if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her , you may take her as your wife .12 Bring her into your home and have her shave her head , trim her nails 13 and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured .After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month , then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife .14 If you are not pleased with her , let her go wherever she wishes .You must not sell her or treat her as a slave , since you have dishonored her .RESPONSE .The answer to the question : \" What is God telling His people to do ?It is obvious that God is speaking to His people about marriage to a woman who was captured as a slave .And kindness , protection and marriage is the context of the passage .Looking at the passage there is not even the hint of a rape .In fact , just the opposite is given .When a woman who is not a Jew is made a captive , and the Israelite falls in love with her because of her beauty , he is not allowed to touch her for those 30 days so that she may mourn the loss of her family and country .The intention of this law is to protect her against any rude passion on the part of the man ( i.e. , rape ) , and give her time to get used to the Jewish culture and begin to learn an affection for the man .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.71547"}

'fits us and [ the wearers of ] the jilbab ( the flowing cloak ) of Quraysh to a tree .By God if we go back to Medina , those who are stronger will drive out the weaker from it . \" ' Then he turned to his tribesmen who were with him and said : \" This is what you have done to yourselves !You allowed them to settle in your lands and divided your wealth with them .Had you kept from them what you had , by God they would have moved to lands other than yours \" .Very soon , these utterances of Abd Allah ibn Ubayy reached Muhammad who was then sitting with Umar b. Khattab .Umar was furious and sought Muhammad 's permission to kill Abd Allah ibn Ubayy forthwith .But Muhammad refused to permit him to do so , saying that slaying of Abd Allah ibn Ubay would simply aggravate the situation further by angering the Ansars .To placate the situation , and to avoid bloodshed , Muhammad then ordered his entourage to proceed towards Medina without delaying further .In this episode we also learn about the mindset of an Islamic fundamentalist .Abd Allah ibn Ubayy 's son .Abd Allah ibn Abd Allah ibn Ubayy was such a fundamentalist .Ibn Sa'd writes : .Abd Allah ibn Abd Allah ibn Ubayy went forward and waited for his father on the way .When he saw him , he made him sit down and said : \" I shall not let you go unless you realize that you have been humbled and Muhammad is honorable . \"Ibn Sa'd vol.ii , p.79 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.41865"}
