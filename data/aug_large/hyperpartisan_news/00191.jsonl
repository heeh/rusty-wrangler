Terry Branstad spent more than $ 200,000 on an advertising campaign - in an election in which he was assured victory - to win one county , meaning he carried all but notoriously liberal Johnson County in a race he won by nearly 22 points .That was money that could have gone toward electing conservatives in the Iowa Senate , which still remains in Democrat control .Once the Iowa General Assembly went back to work in January , the establishment immediately went to work to pass a 43-percent increase in the state 's motor fuel tax .To ensure the bill got to the floor in the Republican - controlled House , legislators were removed from their committees and replaced by establishment Republicans who would vote in favor of the tax hike .And then , after the legislative session was over , the Center for Medical Progress began releasing its investigative videos , exposing Planned Parenthood 's profiting from the sale of the body parts of aborted children .Outrage in Iowa was strong , and calls immediately went out for the state to stop providing taxpayer support for Planned Parenthood .Branstad instead shrugged his shoulders and said there was n't anything he could do .He correctly pointed out there was n't a specific line item in the budget going directly to Planned Parenthood that he could veto ( Iowa governors have line - item veto authority ) .However , he initially ignored the fact that federal block grants administered by the state 's Human Services and Public Health departments were still going to the abortion provider .The state - funded University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics also perform abortions in Iowa , and have notoriously avoided Medicaid billing for those procedures to keep Branstad from being placed in the awkward position of having to reject the charges .Planned Parenthood 's Medicaid contract remains in place , as well , ensuring it receives hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from taxpayers .Conservative Christians in Iowa have been calling for that to end for weeks now , including a rally at the Statehouse to demand action .Instead , the only response they 've gotten from Branstad is a very weak assurance that his administration would ensure no taxpayer dollars are spent directly on abortion services .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.38124"}
