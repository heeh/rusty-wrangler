Smith has definitely done a better job throughout his career on First Take with framing his argument , that 's for sure .Here he knew he was treading into dangerous waters , and then his emotions kicked in , which only exacerbated the problem .His point just did n't hit home .But it seemed to me like he was just trying to protect women .I honestly believe that .He started his argument by saying that there is no place for the abuse of women , and that men should be held responsible for their actions by the law .He then tried to say that women should do their best to recognize these violent types of men and stay away from them .But instead , it blew up in his face .Beadle 's comment was pointed and valid , making it clear that women should not have to change their choices to appease the club swinging , abusive troglodytes that make up a portion of the male population .She 's absolutely right .And obviously a lot of members of the media echoed her sentiment .But I do n't think Stephen A. was going there at all .Once again , to me , it seemed like he was just looking out for all the women he loves in his life , imploring them to recognize these types of men and to stay away from them .His sentiment is n't \" do n't wear a mini - skirt \" it 's \" do n't wear a mini - skirt after midnight in a strange place . \"He 's like a concerned Dad who wants to interrogate the boyfriend before the date .Maybe it 's not his place in the context of modern society to be that guy , but I do believe that his heart was in the right place , and he was n't coming from a place of sexism , but of one of care and concern .It 's never the woman 's fault for getting violated , but we do live in a crazy world full of chaos , and women need to be careful with their choices , because not every guy is a gentleman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.663155"}

{"text": "A New Masculinity .Beginning about a year ago , I became obsessed with the question of whether a universal masculinity exists or not .Are the traits which we consider \" manly \" hardwired into us as a species ?Or are they socially constructed for some specific purpose ?Or maybe some combination of both ?And how does this relate to being attractive to women as well as psychologically sound as men ?You may think this is a funny thing to start obsessing about .But in hindsight , it was n't odd at all .For one , much of my social experience the five years prior , and this very website , were rooted in my experiences within the pick up artist ( PUA ) movement .One could easily argue that a large component of the PUA experience , if not the defining component , is helping men discover and get in touch with their masculinity in order to attract and sleep with more women .The movement focuses on cultivating conventional masculine behaviors : being socially dominant , leading , establishing strong boundaries , pushing one 's will onto others , objectifying and achieving progress .Non - coincidentally , adopting these new behaviors often leads these men to greater success with women .Therefore within the PUA movement , it is tacitly accepted that men are supposed to behave one way and women another .When men deviate from this defined behavior , they 're referred to as pussies or \" AFC 's \" .When women deviate they 're derided as bitches or feminists .( I kid , I kid ... OK , not really . )PUA 's justify these gender roles by butchering one evolutionary psychology theory after another .Now , I 'm not disagreeing with the idea that there may be some sort of biological basis for gender behavior .I 'm just saying the PUA 's butcher the hell out of it .But , I too , took these gender roles for granted as predestined fact .After all , back when I was meager , passive - aggressive and whiny , women were repelled from me .When I began to behave in a dominant , assertive and pushy manner , women began sleeping with me , people began listening to me and internally , my behavior felt right on a deep level .Then in late 2009 , I began to travel all over the world .And within a few months it became impossible to ignore : masculinity and dominance are culturally relative .In America , most women consider me to be cocky and aggressive .In some Asian cultures , women even found me to be brutish and intimidating .Yet in many countries such as Argentina or Ukraine , I came across to women as sensitive and respectful .Hell , many of the women in Brazil are more sexually assertive than I am .And in Russia , when I told a girl I was seeing that most women in America find me to be too aggressive , she began to laugh in my face .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.449356"}

{"text": "You seem to make the point that the Spanish are n't really white men when you say that Indians would have been conquered by them were it not us , and you 're probably right .But the Spanish were white men too .But we come from the British tradition , which eventually turned itself into \" manifest destiny \" in the mid 1800s .I suppose my point here is that , you should n't call an accurate account of history as being hateful .It just is what it is .Like I said in my last round , some Indians might still harbor hatred for white people , but I personally think that the majority of them have moved past it .I come from South Florida , where the Seminoles own and operate a number of casinos that do very well .From my experiences , it seems that they are much more concerned with their businesses and the profit they turn , rather than what white people did to them back in the day .I think you mistake a general hatred for conservative , white people , and particularly men , for a hatred of all straight , white men .Like I said above , women , blacks , hispanics , and most other people ( who are n't ardently conservative ) like Bill Clinton .Even those who do harbor hatred for white people , like what you say , have few bad things to say about Clinton .Most of the people in the groups we 're talking about recognize the distinction between white men who have fought against civil rights for them , and those who fought for it .For example , most black people would remember LBJ fondly while hating George Wallace ( at least up until he tearfully apologized to the NAACP before he died ) .Women love men like Bill Clinton , while hate those who feel as though they should be in the kitchen making us sandwiches , or more reasonably , feel that it is ok that women make only about 80 cents to the dollar that men make .Even among those who do harbor more general hatred for white men , I still contend that most women are too concerned with hating each other than directing their hatred at men , like how I mentioned above .If Obama loses to McCain , it may or may not be considered racism .It depends on what happened in the campaigns .Consider Harold Ford Jr. 's campaign for the Senate in 2006 .He was ahead in the polls with only weeks left before the election in Tennessee , of all states , until the RNC ran the \" call me \" ad .In it , a white woman claims to have met the single Ford at the playboy mansion , and tells Ford to call her while blowing him a kiss , with the insinuation being that Ford is a philandering black man who has sexual relations with white women .Within a week of the ad 's first run , Ford had dropped about 10 % in the polls and never recovered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.02285"}

{"text": "I do n't mean to downplay them .But they 're different .And we 're talking about masculinity here , so deal . )Modern Freudians believe the defining emotional struggle for men is of emotionally disassociating from the safety and care of the emotional ( sexual ? ) attachment with their mother .This disassociation plays out sub - consciously through various life experiences that establish emotional and sexual independence .Examples of this disassociation process include masculine propensities for competitive achievement , sexual conquests , professional success and wealth , political power , etc .These are all common , culturally - normal ways that men have expressed their emotional independence and masculinity in the past .Anthropologists have found that this process of disassociation plays out in men in every culture .What changes is how the process plays itself out , and to what degree .For instance , indigenous tribes in Eastern Africa require adolescent boys to be tortured and maimed publicly to certify their masculinity , whereas Spanish men are forced out of the house at an early age and expected to become breadwinners early on .Japanese men are put through excessive schooling and expected to achieve a certain academic standing .What 's interesting though is that any one conventional expression of masculinity is not universal .Tahitian men lack any sense of machismo and are considered quite lazy by comparison to other cultures , but the men there still express their emotional disassociation in other ways , primarily through social groups and organization .In Trukese culture , it 's accepted that men will be come drunks and excessively violent with each other in their early 20 's .Many hunter - gatherer societies tie masculinity to the ability to hunt and catch food .Our society , up until recently , usually attributed manhood to a man 's ability to accumulate and provide wealth and resources .So the conclusion is that the psychological development of masculinity is universal , but the way it manifests itself is different from culture to culture .Also , this autonomy seems to always be up for debate and has a need to be confirmed by other men in each culture .But Gilmore went further .He wanted to know why masculinity is so hardcore in some places , and considerably tame in others .Why do some African tribes literally whip and cut young boys publicly to test their manhood , whereas other communities in Malaysia judge manhood by who can carve the coolest looking stick ?Gilmore 's theory , set out in his book Manhood in the Making is that the severity of masculinity in a culture - and the chasm between gender roles - is proportional to how treacherous the environment in which that particular society exists is .Cultures that are constantly warring over territory , who have limited resources and have to battle the elements or nature have some seriously hardcore conceptions of masculinity .And rightly so .When you 're constantly defending your only sources of food from invaders and wild animals , you need men to step up and be warriors and protectors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.28798"}

{"text": "We get brought up in school hearing about what our fore - fathers did to native americans and blacks .On the face of it , it seems that everyone hates \" the man \" , who we all know to be \" the white man \" .But let me be brief , for now , about why I this hatred at white men is superficial at best .I often hear from women of all stripes that men are the source of all of their problems , and the problems of the country and the world .Some of this might be true , but I find that women hate themselves and each other more than they hate men .While I often hear women disparage men , much more often I hear them disparage themselves .They tear apart what another woman is wearing , what she is saying , how she is acting , etc .Women constantly feel like they are in competition with each other over men .Only when they temporarily get tired of the constant competition amongst themselves do they stop and blame men for supposedly \" making \" them do all these things .Again , however , they assume we care .Ask most any woman .They will corroborate this .As for native americans , while some of them might pay lip service to the rhetoric of denouncing white men for what we did to them during the 1600 - 1800s , I contend that the majority of them are past it .The majority of them might recognize that what white men did to them back then was horrible , but that this is 2008 and they should live in the modern day .Even if they did all hate us as much as pro contends , their numbers as a percentage of the country 's total population show that their hate would n't amount to much .The same is true for blacks .What white men did to them throughout slavery was horrible , and we should all remember what happened , but many blacks contend that we should live in the here and now .Perhaps more blacks than native americans harbor a personal hatred towards white men for slavery , jim crow , and segregation , but not all of them do .My point is that , even is a majority of blacks genuinely hated \" the white man \" , they only make up about 16 % of the total population , so that hate does n't add up to much numerically .Even if some of these groups do harbor genuine hatred for white men , lets remember that the vast majority of them do n't hate ALL white men .Women , native americans , and blacks have much more love for Bill Clinton than , perhaps , Newt Gingrich or some other representative of conservative , white America .If the premise of this debate was that conservative , white men are the most hated people in the country , I would probably agree .Lumping in all white men in the same category as being more universally hated than everyone else makes that contention false .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.35557"}

{"text": "So what are we supposed to do ?Remember , the key universality is defining an emotional independence for ourselves followed by validation from other men .Simply making money is n't enough anymore .Buying nice things is n't enough anymore .Achievements and conquests by themselves are n't enough .Perhaps you 've done many of these things , and you have felt it .Having money and nice things is nice , but it does n't make you feel like a man anymore .Something 's still lacking .We live in such a culturally relative post - modern world that all of these things are only as valuable and recognized as those around us make them .What I offer is the idea of a post - masculinism , an idea of masculinity that includes conventional masculinism ( dominance , achievement , sexual pursuit ) , but is not confined by social roles or expectations .One man 's rite of passage may be building his own boat and sailing across Lake Michigan .Another man 's rite of passage may be writing and publishing a novel .Another man 's may be living in on a beach in Cuba and volunteering with starving children .The common denominator is that we set out to establish ourselves as emotionally independent through our actions .The common denominator is taking action as individuals .Since there 's no longer any socially universal norm for masculine achievement , we are the first generation of men that must create our own .And what 's more independent or emotionally liberating than that ?It 's a true expression of your individual power and your masculinity .But this is n't easy .And in many ways , we 're ill - equiped for it .Just as women were ill - equipped to supersede their roles in society , we are as well , just in different ways .Striking out on your own path and creating your own rite takes courage , ambition , technical skill , all conventional masculine traits .But it also takes introspection , emotional awareness , vulnerability and a willingness to fail - traits most men are not accustomed to .Entrepreneur and business writer Gary Vaynerchuk often speaks of the idea of personal brand .He claims that in the coming age of social media , our most important asset is going to be our own personal brand that we present to the world .I see the concept of post - masculinity in similar terms : it 's not enough to simply be a bread - winner , to be a provider , to be a walking paycheck anymore .It 's like Tyler Durden says in Fight Club ( the perennial movie of post - masculinity if there were such a thing ) : \" You are not your job .You are not how much money you have in the bank .You are not the contents of your wallet .You 're not your fucking khakis .\" Our canvas is ourselves and we 're all artists .The developmental blueprint is that there is no blueprint .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.536804"}

{"text": "Even those Western leaders who sought to end slavery are condemned by critics today for not having done it sooner or faster .The dangers and constraints of their times have too often been either ignored or brushed aside as mere excuses , as if elected leaders operating under the constitutional law could simply decree whatever they felt was right .Even those slaveholders with aversions to slavery in principle were constrained by a strong tradition of stewardship , in which the family inheritance was not theirs to dispose of in their own lifetime , but to pass on to others as it had been passed on to them .George Washington was one of those who had inherited slaves and , dying childless , freed his slaves in his will , effective on the death of his wife .This is an important point to highlight , because some like Jefferson and Washington understood that simply freeing slaves without giving them the necessary tools and means to survive in society was more like abandonment than liberation .They did consider the possibility of sending freed slaves back to Africa .But the reality was , many of these slaves no longer had ties to Africa , either .One concrete result of the back - to - Africa movement was the establishment of the colony of Liberia on the West African coast , to which freed American blacks were sent during the administration of James Monroe , for whom they named their capital Monrovia .These first settlers were decimated by African diseases to which they no longer had biological resistance- which was just one of the problems of trying to undo the past .Frederick Douglass himself , refused the offer to be sent to Africa , seeing himself as an American .[ Washington 's ] estate in fact continued to pay for the support of some freed slaves for decades after his death , in accordance to his will .The part of Washington 's will dealing with slaves filled almost three pages , and the tone as well as the length of it showed his concerns .There is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do to see a plan adopted for the abolition of it . \" Washington once said , in regards to slavery as a national issue .The moral question for him was easy ; but how to carry it out with compassion and foresight planning was a complex matter .Only through legislation , did Washington see it as a realistic possibility to end the institution ; and he said that the legislator who could achieve that , would get his vote .During his public life , Washington was known to leave behind slaves he brought with him on his travels to the north , in effect , freeing them .His behavior as a slaveowner is also noted in Richard Brookhiser 's Founding Father : .Beginning in the early 1770 's , he rarely bought a slave and he would not sell one , unless the slave consented , which never happened .not selling slaves was an economic loss .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "129.92303"}

{"text": "And that is my story into it .Many people have different stories .Like picking up a book , seeing it in a freak Google search , their parents once was into it , there 's a ton .Many problems facing witches are not only from the misconception of it from other people , but also from witches themselves .Many people , especially rebellious teenagers , will come into Paganism , more commonly Wicca , and think that they must dress in black and they must make it very known that they can do all this different cool stuff .Many people actually look very lowly on being called \" Wiccan \" just because it has become the \" religion \" of rebellious teenagers .Many teenagers who choose to begin practicing Wicca typically get into it because they here about it and choose that it is a way to \" affirm \" their independence .By teenagers , I do n't mean 17 year old 's .I mean the 13 year old girls that run around and feel the need to tell everyone that they are a witch and can read palms , fly on a broom stick , or whatever they come up with in their head .This does not mean for you to run to any 13 year old witch you know and say that they are just rebelling .Just give them the time to see if they stick with it .Many people who are not going to stick with it will give it up after a few months and it will become very obvious .I 'm just letting you know that anybody who is Pagan , or a witch , will constantly be learning .They will never know everything .Many of these people that choose they need to tell everyone what they are cause the problems that many witches face .I saw on Yahoo !Answers a couple days ago a woman had posted \" I am a Witch , I can answer your questions and give you spells for anything \" .I knew right away that this is a person that also is a cause for the misconceptions about witches .She posted this and I had to tell her that she is one reason people understand wrongly .Saying that she knows a spell for everything is not good because too many people think bad when you say that you know a spell .Before you tell people you can do all this cool stuff , you need to make it known that you are not turning people into toads or cooking up some weird concoction that involves eye of a toad and the leg of a cat .That 's just wrong to do .I hope that Pagans and Wiccans out there wills start helping to change the views faced upon us , whether it be Internet or face - to - face .Remember , it can still be dangerous to us because many people may believe in harming witches .I did not write this to put people down , but Wicca and Witchcraft and Paganism is not something you choose to do just because you want to rebel or because you want to try something new .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "130.46146"}

{"text": "He was defeated in both these efforts . on the national scene , Jefferson returned to the battle once again in 1784 , proposing a law declaring slavery illegal in all western territories of the country as it existed at the that time .Such a ban would have kept slavery out of Alabama and Mississippi .The bill lost by one vote , that of a legislator too sick to come and vote .Afterwards , Jefferson said that the fate \" of millions unborn \" was \" hanging on the tongue of one man , and heaven was silent in that awful moment .\" Three years later , however , Congress compromised by passing the Northwest Ordinance , making slavery illegal in the upper western territories , while allowing it in the lower western territories .Congress was later authorized to ban the African slave trade and Jefferson , now President , urged that they use that authority to stop Americans \" from all further participation in those violations of human rights which has been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa .Congress followed his urging .Abstract moral decisions are much easier to make on paper or in a classroom in later centuries than in the midst of the dilemmas actually faced by those living in very different circumstances , including serious dangers .One way to understand the constraints of the times and their effects on public attitudes is to examine the difference between the way that many in nineteenth - century America saw the slave trade , as distinguished from the way that they saw slavery itself .Thus , decades before slavery was abolished , the United States joined in the outlawing of the international slave trade .Even many Americans not yet ready to support the abolition of slavery as an institution nevertheless made the bringing of more slaves from Africa a capital offense in the United States .The moral distinction between slave trading and the continuation of slavery as an institution might be hard for some in later centuries to understand because , in the abstract , there is no moral difference .Only in the concrete circumstances faced by the people of the times was there a practical social difference .Try putting yourself in the context of the times , and the social constraints of what was possible .Your casting moral judgment is anachronistic .Moral choices can be made only from options that are actually available to be made .More excerpts from Sowell 's Black Rednecks and White Liberals : .We can not assume twenty - first century options , or even present - day knowledge , when judging decisions made in the 19th century .Nor can we assume that we have superior knowledge of the social realities of an earlier era that we never lived through , compared to the first - hand knowledge of those who confronted those realities daily and inescapably .Moral Questions about slavery have been , almost exclusively , Western moral questions .Non - Western societies had neither moral concerns about slavery nor , in most cases , the power to decide on the continuance or extinction of the institution for themselves during the era of European imperialism , when slavery was suppressed over most of the world by the West .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "140.20393"}

{"text": "Flying is fun , but really I would rather roll on the roads than fly .I never felt comfortable when my human was flying me because I could n't stop , or change direction very well , but my human said that flying was only for special times of the year and for \" emergencies \" where we had to be someplace very fast .One night my human met the other witches in a big field .He told me that we had to heal someone very important , even though that person did not want to be healed but wanted to die .I asked him if this was n't a Bad Thing because we were doing something to a person that the person did n't want , and he said no , not this time .Also they saw that if they healed this person that the person would be very happy after doing the Really Good Things .My human also said that this might get scary for me because I could talk to him and felt things that other bicycles could n't feel .I did n't know what happened , but I knew it did n't make my human very happy .One thing I really liked was getting groceries .I have some nice things on my rack that hold lots of groceries and my human would fill me up and ride me home from the store and put all the stuff inside the house .Either way was fun for me , because I was doing what I had been made for , and doing what you are made for is a very special thing for a bicycle .When a bicycle is doing what it was made for , everything is as perfect as it can get .One thing I can do that makes my human kinda mad at me is I can whistle at dogs and make them bark .My human does n't like barking dogs , but I think it 's fun to whistle and make the dogs bark .When dogs bark they 're talking , but I do n't understand Dog .And that 's what things were like right until they were n't like that any more .This also was not unusual , the Fire Witch was usually in a bad mood when he sweated a lot and it was still early in the day .We were getting some things from the store , what my human called \" consumable tools \" that would get used up while he worked on things .That was another reason he was in a bad mood , because he hated tools that turned to dust while they worked and lately he was complaining that his consumable tools were getting consumed at an even faster pace than usual .When he came out of the store he was actually so mad that the sweat was turning to vapor on his head with curly whisps coming out of the vents in his helmet . \" The price of the cut - offs went up again , \" he growled . \" The price keeps going up and the quality keeps going down , just like with the BSOs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "160.83731"}
