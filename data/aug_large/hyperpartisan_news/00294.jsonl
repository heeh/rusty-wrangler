{"text": "In a nutshell , the elites of the both the Republican and Democratic parties were heavy into the CIA drug trade in the 1980 's .Bill Clinton had gotten his favorite state trooper L.D. Brown into the CIA .Brown , a non - corrupt person , was put on a roundtrip flight to Central American with the CIA 's Barry Seal ( CIA contractor as most operatives are ) .Brown was mortified to discover to cocaine coming back on the roundtrip to Arkansas .That Clinton quote is my favorite quote in modern American politics and I think it sums up the situation nicely .Now do you understand why Jeb Bush awards a \" Liberty Medal \" to Hillary Clinton for her supposed support of the Constitution ?The Clintons got married to the Bushes during Iran - Contra and those marital vows - unlike the Bill / Hillary marital vows , will never be broken .Too much permanent liability , including murders , is sitting on the table .A Hillary / Jeb 2016 presidential race would be \" heads they win \" and \" tails the American people lose \" proposition .The Bushes and the Clintons need desperately need each other in order to protect themselves from the rest of America who should have put both families in jail a long time ago .Bill Clinton has been CIA since he was recruited at Oxford in fall , 1968 .GHW Bush has been CIA since before the Bay of Pigs operation , which he helped to organize in 1961 .Barry Seal - until his murder by the US government in 1986 - had worked with the CIA since before this photo below was taken with him and other Operation 40 operatives in Mexico City in the early 1960 's .The Clintons are every bit as ruthless as the Bushes and vice versa .People ask , have the Clintons ever murdered anyone ?Besides all the folks who got torched at Waco in 1993 , the murder of Jerry Parks on September 26 , 1993 , may very well have been a Bill Clinton / Raymond Buddy Young murder .Jerry Parks was in the 1980 's CIA drug trade and working for the Clintons .Parks , also a private investigator , was hired by Hillary and Vince Foster to spy on Bill and document his womanizing when Hillary was thinking about divorcing Bill around 1990 or so .That was when Bill was having a spectacularly flagrant affair with Mary Jo Jenkins .In summer 1993 , Jerry Parks was in an $ 80,000 billing dispute with the Clintons .Parks had not been paid his money from the 1992 campaign and he was most definitely not a happy camper and he was someone who knew more damaging dirt ( personal , political , criminal ) on the Clintons than just about anyone on earth .I am 100 % certain that Bill used Buddy Young and his inner circle state troopers to beat up and nearly murder Gary Johnson on June , 26 , 1992 , in order to keep a lid on the Gennifer Flowers sex scandal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.3899"}
