Clapper released a statement which an excerpt read \" The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans .President Barack Obama speaking in California on Friday , June 7 attempted to reassure the public that their phone calls were not being recorded , \" Nobody is listening to your telephone calls .They are not looking at people 's names , and they 're not looking at content .But by sifting through this so - called metadata , they may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism , \" Obama said .The phone and internet surveillance program known as PRISM has popular support in Congress and there seems there might not be grand scale opposition in either the House of Representatives or the Senate .Chair of the Intelligence Committee Senator Dianne Feinstein , D - CA stated that the records collection was a part of the 2001 Patriot Act and said \" It 's called protecting America ....I understand privacy .... we want to protect people 's private rights and that is why this is carefully done .President Obamas also made it clear on Friday that although the program was a secret to the public , but there was bipartisan support and knowledge of the data collection program from Congress . \"The President continued \" The relevant intelligence committees are fully briefed on these programs .These are programs that have been authorized by broad , bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006 .Speaker of the House John Boehner , a Republican agreed with Obama in an interview on Tuesday morning , June 11with ABC News ' George Stephanopoulos . \"He 's a traitor , \" Boehner declared about Snowden 's press leak .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.47458"}
