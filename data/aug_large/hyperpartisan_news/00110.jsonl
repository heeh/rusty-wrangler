{"text": "Network News .When Sens .Barack Obama and John McCain take the stage for the presidential debates , attentive viewers may notice both candidates scribbling notes with their left hands .Political junkies will remember that such a curiosity has occurred before : In 1992 , all three contenders -- George H.W. Bush , Bill Clinton and Ross Perot -- were southpaws .In the race for the White House , lefties seem to have the upper hand .No matter who wins in November , six of the 12 chief executives since the end of World War II will have been left - handed : Harry Truman , Gerald Ford , Ronald Reagan , the elder Bush , Clinton and either Obama or McCain .That 's a disproportionate number , considering that only one in 10 people in the general population is left - handed .For years , left - handedness was not treated as a point of pride , much less a qualification for high office .Remnants of anti - leftiness are everywhere : A right - hand man is indispensable , but who wants a dancing partner with two left feet ?The words \" adroitness \" and \" dexterity \" derive from the French and Latin words for \" right , \" while \" gauche \" and \" sinister \" derive from the words for \" left . \"In the New Testament , the souls of sinners who fail to meet with the Savior 's approval are sent to his left -- and to eternal damnation .No wonder that , well into the 20th century , children who showed signs of left - handedness when writing were forced to switch hands .Even today , left - handers are thought to be accident - prone ( not true ) , and a study once showed them to be at risk for early death ( it was debunked ) .But what about their brains ?Is it possible that right- and left - handed people -- and presidents -- think differently ?Perhaps .Some left - handers may be better armed for th e challenges of leadership because of the way their brains handle language and dexterity ( sorry , there 's no other word ) .For nearly all right - handers , language abilities reside exclusively on one side of the brain -- usually the left , which controls the right hand .But one in seven lefties process language on bo th sides of the brain , possibly because using their left hands during childhood stimulated the development of the right half .So Reagan , Bill Clinton and Obama may have left - handedness to thank for their legendary speaking abilities .The benefits of being a lefty are n't only verbal .Many artists and great political thinkers were lefties -- Pablo Picasso and Benjamin Franklin , for example .Lefties are overrepresented among the mathematically talented and are also more likely to find unexpected or counterintuitive solutions on problem - solving tests .So maybe the number of left - handed presidents is n't so surprising after all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.13327"}

{"text": "It 's Good for You .It may be an age - old saying that makes most people groan whenever a friend or family member feels the need to say it , but there are actual psychological benefits that come from simply putting on a smile .Researchers have been examining this phenomenon for a few decades now and even though it is not a new age , 21st century discovery , it is nonetheless amazing and unexpected .One would intuitively assume that facial expressions are an external representation of what is going on inside the brain .Classically , facial expressions are considered to be influenced by mood and thought .It seems to be a one - way street in which the brain controls the face , but this is not the case .Charles Darwin hypothesized that emotional facial expressions are an innate and universal human characteristic .A happy face is a happy face no matter where you are in the world .This theory has been thoroughly explored and psychologists have produced evidence that supports this century - old speculation .This is convenient in a way , because if facial expressions were specific to a geographic region , people would have to learn faces as if they were learning a new language .What a challenge that would be !But the more interesting aspect to these universal facial expressions is that the physical expression can directly influence one 's emotions .Studies on this finding were approached in multiple ways .One study conducted at Clark University in Worcester , MA instructed patients to move certain parts of their face in various ways , such as raising the eyebrows or relaxing the mouth , and then reporting their emotions .( The patients were not told that the study had anything to do with emotion . )In another study performed by a group of German researchers , patients were told to clench a pen in their front teeth , creating a smile , or hold the pen in their protruding lips , creating a pout , and then report their emotional state .In these studies , patient 's emotions were consistent with the resulting facial expression .So , it can be inferred from these findings that making a happy face can help make you happy .It must be noted that changing facial expression is not a means of changing one 's whole state of mind .Certainly someone who is mourning can not just put on a smile and instantly be cured of all sadness .It is not that simple .It is more realistic to think that facial expression can influence emotion , not directly change it .We would all be in for quite a roller coaster ride of emotion if the opposite were true , and a rapid change of facial expression was able to instantaneously change our moods .If this finding is valid then there must be some physical explanation or neural substrate to explain it .Even though researchers observed this phenomenon decades ago , a full explanation is yet to be obtained .There are a number of hypotheses , though .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.508865"}

{"text": "But it reminds me of that Dr. Seuss book One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish .I confess the charm of Dr. Seuss wore off for me a great deal faster than it did for my kids ...Even after reading his books aloud over and over and over and over again to my kids they still loved them .Once they began to read , I had to listen to them read them aloud over and over and over and over again .Of course , my antipathy toward Dr. Seuss was nothing compared to my feelings about a giant purple dinosaur whose name will not be spoken here .Suffice to say , his affections were most assuredly not returned by me .I could n't even listen to the YouTube video of that song without shuddering and I shut it off after the first line .But I digress .In this study ( freely accessible online thanks to PLoSONE ) researchers look at how having either a Democrat or Republican political affiliation may change how your brain functions during risky decision - making .It is also important to note that these researchers use the descriptors Democrat / Liberal and Republican / Conservative interchangeably .They believe that this idea is valid and point to a 1998 article to explain : . \" While party registration is not a perfect proxy for ideology , a realignment that started in the 1970s has caused the two to become increasingly correlated over the past 40 years .Political polarization at both the mass and elite levels have created a period where ideology and partisanship are substantially overlapping concepts .This trend has been even stronger in California ( where the participants in this study resided ) than in other states . \"\" However , our evidence indicates that since the 1970s , ideological polarization has increased dramatically among the mass public in the United States as well as among political elites .There are now large differences in outlook between Democrats and Republicans , between red state voters and blue state voters , and between religious voters and secular voters .These divisions are not confined to a small minority of activists - they involve a large segment of the public and the deepest divisions are found among the most interested , informed , and active citizens .Moreover , contrary to Fiorina 's suggestion that polarization turns off voters and depresses turnout , our evidence indicates that polarization energizes the electorate and stimulates political participation .\" The current researchers cite prior research on what the brains of liberals and conservatives look like structurally .Using a \" simple gambling game \" , prior research found that \" liberals and conservatives have significantly different brain structure , with liberals showing increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex , and conservatives showing increased gray matter volume in the in the amygdala \" .For the current research , the researchers looked at what areas of the brain were used during those gambling tasks and found a difference in what parts of the brain were activated during those decisions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.36883"}
