Mark Udall is the most vulnerable Obama - state Democratic incumbent .He faces a major challenge from Gardner , and polling suggests it will be a hard slog .Iowa seems a likelier possibility to fall than Colorado primarily because it 's an open seat ; Democrats might also benefit from the Centennial State 's new election system , which automatically sends a mail ballot to every voter and should increase Colorado 's turnout .Should a tidal wave develop , the next two Democratic seats in its path are Michigan and New Hampshire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.98386"}
{"text": "While Riley has rightly been focusing on his gubernatorial dutues , Roy Moore has been driving the agenda that will determine who the GOP nominee will be .Roy Moore has shrewdly refrained from focusing solely on the 10 Commandments case and instead has advocated several populist issues .While certainly not universally popular , Moore 's campaign platform is much more developed and detailed than anything put forward by either Riley or the two leading Democrats .For example , Moore 's call for legislative sessions every other year ( instead of the current system of annual sessions ) forced his opponents to take a position on the otherwise off - the - radar issue .Similarly , Moore 's call for term limits certainly has bipartisan appeal to those disgruntled with the \" politics as usual \" approach .Moore is trying ( fairly effectively thus far ) to transition from being solely identified with his religious stands to a conservative leaning populist platform that casts himself as the disaffected everyman trying to return state government to the average Alabamian .But the master stroke of Moore 's campaign thus far is his framing of the tax appraisal issue .Riley 's contention that the yearly appraisal is required by state law leaving nothing the governor 's office can do to remedy it may be legally correct .But focusing solely on the political implications of the appraisal issue , Roy Moore seems to have Bob Riley right where he wants him .The beauty of Moore 's tactic is that it both forces Riley into the untenable \" pro - tax \" position , and inevitably reminds Republicans about the Amendment One debacle .Indeed , Riley 's resurgence is largely due to recent events overshadowing his 2003 tax package defeat .But Moore has not only found a way to resurrect the issue of Riley 's past proposed tax increases , but also has cast Riley as a current and consistent \" pro - tax \" governor .The success of Moore 's tactics are proven by the unlikely support Don Siegelman , who joins Moore in attacking both Riley 's position as well as the governor 's rationale behind it ( \" That is just hogwash , \") .Riley obviously does not have the luxury of a full - time focus on the campaign unlike his primary opponent .But Moore 's campaign has shown surprising shrewdness and skill and has successfully bested the governor in the campaign 's first battle .Fortunately for Riley , the first votes are still 8 months away , but the governor can not let Moore continue to dictate the terms of the debate if he expects to be re - elected .Chairman Bachus ?With the retirement of Rep.

George Allen of Virginia as they try to score a victory over the moderate / liberal candidates in their party like John McCain and Rudy Guliani .As a matter of fact , my sense is Republican establishment types are looking to move Alabama up as a bulwark against a moderate Republican taking the nomination , much as South Carolina ended McCain 's challenge to George W. Bush in 2000 .For the Democrats , they are looking to move up a state that has a large proportion of minorities ( unlike the very white states of Iowa and New Hampshire ) .The possibility of an early primary in a state where 40 % of the Democratic primary electorate is African - American must be music to the Rev. Al Sharpton 's ears .Given the lackluster crop of Dem . candidates that 'll be challenging Hillary Clinton , I 'd give Sharpton a real shot at coming in a strong second in an Alabama primary .While it is much too early to make meaningful predictions about 2008 , it is not too early to see that the primary calendar , and Alabama 's place in it , may be very important in determining who the party 's standard bearers will be .The Obligatory Siegelman Post .The poll had both good news and bad news for Siegelman .A plurality of voters ( 44%)thought that he should abandon his bid for a second term in the governor 's office , but only 20 % expect Siegelman to actually be convicted in his upcoming racketeering trial .So , though I am always up for picking apart a poll , I just did n't see much to chew on in this one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.2041"}

Shelley Moore Capito has not .National Democrats also have shown little interest in backing likely nominee Rick Weiland in South Dakota , while they are more bullish on Secretary of State Natalie Tennant in West Virginia , which also has a long history of electing Democrats to the Senate .( South Dakota 's record is more mixed . )In any event , these two seats are probably gone for the Democrats even if President Obama and his party bounce back in a big way over the next several months .A \" ripple \" is enough to wash them away .Then comes Montana : Sen. John Walsh is an incumbent , but an appointed one .Appointees have a mixed track record of success in winning a full term .Freshman Rep. Steve Daines , Walsh 's likely Republican opponent , won statewide in 2012 ( Montana has only one House seat ) and is arguably better known .That 's why Walsh is more endangered than senators in redder states like Alaska , Arkansas and Louisiana , and the limited polling we have backs that up .If the Democrats stop the wave here , they will have had about as good an election night as one could reasonably expect .As the wave builds , next comes Arkansas and Louisiana .Sen.

{"text": "Wednesday , November 23 , 2005 .A Closer Look at the Looming Special Election in House District 31 .With the passing of Jack Venable , House District 31 will soon host a special election that could signal a sea - change within the State House .Though Venable easily held this district for the past 30-plus years , Republicans will surely target this district and attempt to use a win here as a springboard into the 2006 elections .Governor Riley will most likely announce the dates for the special election in the next week or two .Recent special elections have taken about 5 months to see a successor take office and that is probably a reasonable estimation for this seat as well .Though we do n't know the exact dates for the special election , it is obvious this district will see a competitive race to succeed Venable .The district itself contains portions of both Coosa and Elmore county .Looking at the precinct level results from the 2002 elections it appeared to me that the actual voting percentage broke down to around 79 % from Elmore and 21 % from Coosa .This is good news for the GOP as Elmore county is a Republican stronghold and looks likely to outweigh the Democratic lean of Coosa .More specifically I also crunched the 2002 Governor 's race numbers from the district .My calculations had Riley carrying the district with 61 % to Siegelman 's 39 % .I used the governor 's race numbers because I thought it would be as good an indicator as any of the partisan feelings of the district since the race was essentially 50/50 statewide .I should stipulate that it 's possible I misread some of the Excel tables , so some of the figures could be a little off .And of course a state house race has a different dynamic than a governor 's race , but I think these numbers give a sense of the general GOP lean of the district .Democrats best hope would be to run Venable 's widow or perhaps one of his children as someone with the Venable name could take advantage of the goodwill accrued throughout the decades .However , even Venable 's margins decreased over the years as his district grew more Republican .2002 saw Venable 's lowest victory margin as he won 58 % of the vote .The candidates and campaigns will certainly determine who the next representative is , but Democrats have their work cut out for them to hold the seat .And Republicans have an opportunity to flip a Democratic seat before the 06 elections and show they mean business in the battle for control of the State House .Tuesday , November 22 , 2005 .AL Gov Candidates Now Online .With the recent emergence of Don Siegelman 's campaign website , all four major announced gubernatorial candidates now have their campaign sites active .( Links to campaign sites can be found in the AlabamaElections Directory ) .Of course campaigns are n't won or lost on the basis of their websites , but an able web operation can recruit volunteers and secure fundraising that might not have come through the conventional campaign structure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.44189"}

{"text": "Force the accusers if lying to face the risk of jail for lying under oath or withdrawing .The accusers and accused alike risk fines and jail for lying under oath , the attorneys ask the hard questions .All in the context of the civil authority which stands to gain or to lose nothing no matter the verdict .In that way what is on the internet and a matter of public record has a credible conclusion to the doubters on all sides .We really as church need to think hard , it might be in our long term interest in the modern context to have these cases , once public , to be laundered and closed in public as well .I believe there is some confusion over what are the Winnipeg Police vs the R.C.M.P. Broadly speaking , with the exception of Ontario & Quebec , the R.C.M.P. are , Provincial / Territory small cities / large towns(pop .10,000+)police force .Ontario & Quebec have their own distinct provincial police .Winnipeg has it 's own Police , separate and apart from the R.C.M.P. There is collaboration between City / R. C.M.P. on a case by case basis , whether the R.C.M.P. are working on the Seraphim case is unknown .Also the R.C.M.P. have the most technical \" C.S.I. \" lab in the country so small/ large \" City Police \" depts will send evidence for forensic testing .Again , broadly speaking , the accused has a right to trial , by judge , or by a judge and a jury .Judge not lest ye be judged worst of sinners .This is such a sad situation and no matter how it turns out , it will remain a tragedy .I met + Seraphim only once and he seemed to me to be a humble and spiritual man .I do n't have a clue as to what really happened , but it is up to the courts to decide .Please , let 's wait for the courts to decide .And again , as is so often the case , thank you Mark for clarifying the \" excise from the clergy \" statement ... wow , was that one ever off the mark !Thank you also to the OCA who acted carefully , thoughtfully and I am sure prayerfully , and it was n't afraid to take the appropriate steps .I understand your comments to be supportive to + S and dismissive , even hostile to \" the accusers \" , whoever they may be .Certainly you do not seem open to the idea that they might be \" the victims . \" But \" He said , THEY said \" is actually the point here .It is not just one person involved so their joint statements must be taken even more seriously than if it was a lone accuser / victim .Is this not a disgrace to the Church ?Although serious questions remain about the possibility of past administrative coverups , the OCA has now made it clear to all that there is a serious investigation and + S has been suspended until vindication .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.27395"}
