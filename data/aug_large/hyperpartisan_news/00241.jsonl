Marco Rubio or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz .Pollster Frank Luntz makes the argument that Bloomberg has an actual path to national victory and uses Ross Perot 's 1992 independent candidacy to support his analysis .He quotes period surveys that found Perot beginning his first presidential quest with low single - digit voter preference , rising as high as 39 % in the polls , and ending with 19 % of the popular vote .Luntz believes Bloomberg has the potential to do much better particularly when his data finds the Independent already approaching 30 % , approximately 10 times better than Perot 's beginning point .What Luntz fails to consider , however , is the Electoral Vote count and what his potential candidacy could do to realistically change the overall outcome .While Perot scored a more than respectable 19 % back in 1992 , he recorded no Electoral Votes because he failed to win even one state .Should Bloomberg run , and win a small number of states in tight three - way splits , his EV total would not elect him President .Rather , it would likely cast the contest into the House of Representatives , which has the power to choose the presidential winner should no candidate attain a majority in the Electoral College .Considering the Republican dominance in the House , such an ending would almost assuredly favor the GOP candidate .The Luntz poll provides us an additional interesting glimpse .Most Independent candidacies in the past , and certainly was the case with Perot 's bids in 1992 and 1996 , tended to benefit the Democratic candidate because the Republican nominee bled support into the Independent column .This time , however , it appears the GOP candidate would get a boost because Bloomberg appears to be taking more support from Hillary Clinton .In the three proposed ballot tests , Trump and Rubio score close wins against Clinton , while the former secretary of state and first lady would top Sen. Cruz in an equally close spread .Trump would lead Clinton and Bloomberg , 37 - 33 - 29 % , in the national popular vote , while Rubio would score a 38 - 35 - 28 % victory .In the final scenario , Ms. Clinton defeats Sen.

Cruz took the state because the system was tailor - made for his strong grassroots campaign style .Expectations for Trump rose during the latter part of January , largely attributable to virtually every public poll suggesting he would finish first .The fact that no candidate even reached 30 % , let alone the 50 % needed to capture the majority of delegates , suggests that yielding a contested Republican convention is certainly a possibility on the political horizon .Now having three candidates with similar strength is another element that potentially makes an eventual deadlock more likely .Donald Trump , rebounding to finish first in New Hampshire coupled with a strong showing from a candidate such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich would further cloud the overall political picture .Such a result would make reaching a majority even more difficult for any of the contenders .Former Florida Gov.

Marco Rubio or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz .Pollster Frank Luntz makes the argument that Bloomberg has an actual path to national victory and uses Ross Perot 's 1992 independent candidacy to support his analysis .He quotes period surveys that found Perot beginning his first presidential quest with low single - digit voter preference , rising as high as 39 % in the polls , and ending with 19 % of the popular vote .Luntz believes Bloomberg has the potential to do much better particularly when his data finds the Independent already approaching 30 % , approximately 10 times better than Perot 's beginning point .What Luntz fails to consider , however , is the Electoral Vote count and what his potential candidacy could do to realistically change the overall outcome .While Perot scored a more than respectable 19 % back in 1992 , he recorded no Electoral Votes because he failed to win even one state .Should Bloomberg run , and win a small number of states in tight three - way splits , his EV total would not elect him President .Rather , it would likely cast the contest into the House of Representatives , which has the power to choose the presidential winner should no candidate attain a majority in the Electoral College .Considering the Republican dominance in the House , such an ending would almost assuredly favor the GOP candidate .The Luntz poll provides us an additional interesting glimpse .Most Independent candidacies in the past , and certainly was the case with Perot 's bids in 1992 and 1996 , tended to benefit the Democratic candidate because the Republican nominee bled support into the Independent column .This time , however , it appears the GOP candidate would get a boost because Bloomberg appears to be taking more support from Hillary Clinton .In the three proposed ballot tests , Trump and Rubio score close wins against Clinton , while the former secretary of state and first lady would top Sen.

Cruz and Mr. Bloomberg , 37 - 35 - 28 % , respectively .Bloomberg 's presence also holds both major party nominees below 40 % in all three scenarios , at least according to this earliest of polls testing a major three - way campaign .As we noted earlier this week , the former New York mayor would have plenty in the way of campaign financing , thereby ensuring he would have the wherewithal to tell his story .In his favor would be distrust of both the status quo and the major political parties .Against him are his extreme positions on gun control and enacting government dictates over personal life style .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.241684"}

Bernie Sanders ending in a virtual tie .According to the latest available number , the two split the delegate pool almost evenly , with Ms. Clinton leading by only four delegates from a pool exceeding 1,300 .Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley , who scored just eight delegates but a number large enough to make the difference between Clinton and Sanders , suspended his campaign in response to the polling results .The same is true for ex - Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on the GOP side .Huckabee , the 2008 Iowa Caucus winner , finished ninth among Republicans with just 2 % voter support .The Republican turnout is the largest in Iowa Caucus history .When all of the votes are tabulated , the participation factor will top 185,000 , far more than the previous record of 121,255 established in 2012 .The Democratic system does not report the actual number of raw votes per candidate , instead using only the candidates ' delegate totals .The Caucus result proved close to what was projected a month ago , meaning Sen. Cruz took the state because the system was tailor - made for his strong grassroots campaign style .Expectations for Trump rose during the latter part of January , largely attributable to virtually every public poll suggesting he would finish first .The fact that no candidate even reached 30 % , let alone the 50 % needed to capture the majority of delegates , suggests that yielding a contested Republican convention is certainly a possibility on the political horizon .Now having three candidates with similar strength is another element that potentially makes an eventual deadlock more likely .Donald Trump , rebounding to finish first in New Hampshire coupled with a strong showing from a candidate such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich would further cloud the overall political picture .Such a result would make reaching a majority even more difficult for any of the contenders .Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush 's poor 3 % performance will increase speculation about him exiting the race .He will likely fare better in New Hampshire than Iowa , but probably wo n't break into double - digits .The Iowa Caucus met expectations for excitement with two close finishes .The Republican delegate allotment for Iowa is only 30 .This means Sen. Cruz scored just one more delegate vote than Trump and Rubio .Ms. Clinton amassed 23 delegates to Bernie Sanders ' 21 .Next comes New Hampshire on February 9 .Floor Fight !The Contested Convention .The Republicans .The Iowa Republican precinct caucuses ended in a virtual three - way tie , with no candidate receiving even 30 % of the vote .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.318146"}
