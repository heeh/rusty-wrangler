Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he was suspending New York 's participation in a federal immigration enforcement plan that has drawn fire from immigrant advocates , civil liberties lawyers and elected officials in the state and around the country .A statement from Mr. Cuomo 's office said there was \" mounting evidence \" that the program , called Secure Communities , had not only failed to meet its goal of deporting the most serious immigrant criminals but was also undermining law enforcement and compromising public safety .\" There are concerns about the implementation of the program as well as its impact on families , immigrant communities and law enforcement in New York , \" Mr. Cuomo said .Unless those concerns are eased , the statement said , New York will not take part .Mr. Cuomo 's decision makes New York the second state to announce its intention to withdraw from the program , and sets up a confrontation with the Obama administration , which has made Secure Communities a cornerstone of immigration enforcement strategy .Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois said in May that he was canceling his state 's participation .Under the program , begun by the Bush administration in 2008 , the fingerprints of everyone booked into a local or county jail are sent to the Department of Homeland Security and compared with prints in its files .If officials find that a suspect is in the country illegally , or is a noncitizen with a criminal record , they may seek to deport the person .By Wednesday , that fingerprint sharing had been introduced in about 41 percent of the nation 's jurisdictions , including 27 of 62 counties in New York .Mr. Cuomo 's move means that those counties ' participation will end .The entire country is scheduled to join the program by 2013 .The practical effects of Mr. Cuomo 's decision are unclear .New York law enforcement agencies regularly check fingerprints with the Federal Bureau of Investigation .Homeland Security officials said that regardless of New York 's participation in Secure Communities , the F.B.I. would still share fingerprints with the immigration agency .Federal officials said that if states did not share fingerprints with the F.B.I. , those states would lose access to federal criminal databases , undermining their ability to fight crime .While Secure Communities has contributed to a sharp rise in deportations under President Obama , it does not appear to have won him many allies .It has angered immigrants who supported Democrats in recent elections .It has also failed to convince many of the president 's Republican opponents that he is sufficiently committed to enforcement .Opponents of the program contend that even though it was mainly intended to ensnare convicted criminals and people deemed a security threat , it has instead caught too many immigrants charged with low - level crimes or guilty only of being in the country illegally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.21431"}

{"text": "This attitude is encouraged by certain influential national organizations , including the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the International Association of Chiefs of Police .The mayor and police chief of Providence , R.I. , recently invoked \" the chilling effect \" argument to defend their city 's failure to make use of ICE 's Law Enforcement Support Center to screen arrested aliens .In 2008 this policy resulted in the release of an illegal alien offender wanted by ICE , who has since been accused of kidnapping and raping a local woman in a public park .The origins of the \" chilling effect \" theory are unclear , and hard evidence of the phenomenon is non - existent in crime statistics , social science research , or real - life law enforcement experience .In fact , immigrants reporting crime are one of the main ways ICE launches investigations against criminal aliens - especially in gang cases .One veteran immigration agent told us , \" During my 27 years of experience , 99 percent of our information and leads came from the alien community , either because they had been a victim of crime or had been denied work . \" While rumors abound of illegal aliens who allegedly refrain from reporting crimes out of fear of deportation , we could find no substantiated cases of crime victims who were removed as a result of having reported crimes to authorities unless the victims turned out to be criminals as well .Agencies who shun contact with ICE are denying themselves and victims the opportunity to take advantage of these provisions .For example , someone who is a victim of a gang crime ( or any crime ) who happens to be an illegal alien might be needed to testify or otherwise assist in the prosecution of the criminal .If the alien lacks status , he is subject to removal at any time .To ensure that does not happen , the local agency should seek ICE 's help in arranging special status , temporary or otherwise , until the case is resolved .Common sense suggests that these tools represent a much more powerful way to encourage cooperation from the immigrant community than non - cooperation or sanctuary policies .The most authoritative statistics on crime reporting fail to support the \" chilling effect \" theory .First of all , non - reporting of crime is a problem throughout the country and across racial and ethnic lines .According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) surveys on crime victimization and reporting , only about 50 percent of all crimes are ever reported to police .Furthermore , Hispanics are actually slightly more likely than non - Hispanics to report crimes .For example , in 2005 , the most recent year available , Hispanics reported 51 percent of all violent crimes to police , while non - Hispanics reported 47 percent .59 While the Hispanic cohort is not a perfect proxy for immigrants , if immigrants as a group truly were less likely to report crimes than the native population , it would be apparent in these statistics , because Hispanics are significantly more likely to be immigrants than non - Hispanics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.52031"}

{"text": "The victim must have suffered substantial harm , must cooperate in the prosecution of the perpetrator , and must have information that is valuable to the law enforcement agencies .While the U visa has proved beneficial in a significant number of cases , it is also vulnerable to abuse .Some local police departments have expressed concerns that individuals and advocates acting on behalf of illegal aliens have put pressure on officers to sign off on a U visa application even if it is not evident that an actual crime has occurred .Sanctuary Policies Protect Gangsters .Some local jurisdictions , usually in or near major cities , have faced pressure from ethnic advocacy groups to adopt policies that discourage police cooperation or interaction with ICE .Some of these policies are relatively benign , such as forbidding local officers from randomly questioning residents about immigration status .Other jurisdictions have limited officers to making immigration inquiries only for serious and/or felony offenders .The existence of sanctuary or \" do n't ask , do n't tell \" immigration policies may help explain why ICE has arrested relatively few gang members in certain cities that have serious gang problems ( see Table 2 ) .For example , Los Angeles is widely known as the \" gang capital \" of the country .In early 2007 , the city estimated that it had 720 gangs with 39,000 members .These gangs were responsible for the majority of the city 's murders and 70 percent of all the shootings .Several immigrant gangs were listed on the city 's \" Worst Gangs \" list .56 Yet ICE arrested only 293 immigrant gangsters over the three - year period covered by this report , only the 10th highest total for all ICE offices .Similarly low arrest numbers were noted in Phoenix and Houston , which also had non - cooperation policies in place .Oregon is one of four official sanctuary states .Non - cooperation policies can seriously hamper gang suppression efforts in jurisdictions having trouble with immigrant gangsters .Sometimes , creative ICE agents working investigations will find other partners .In the District of Columbia , where police leaders want no part of immigration law enforcement , ICE agents have worked with the National Park Service instead .In most places , however , the result of non - cooperation is that immigrant gangsters get recycled repeatedly through the criminal justice system and are continually provided more opportunity to succeed as gangsters .Some of the non - cooperative cities have begun to concede the public safety value of removing immigrant gangsters , and have taken small steps in the other direction , such as by targeting the most serious immigrant offenders who can be identified in prisons and jails .For example , in December 2007 the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's Office , in partnership with the local U.S. Attorney and ICE , began a program to prosecute and remove incarcerated immigrant gangsters who have been previously deported .58 Such programs are commendable because they prevent the release of some gangsters back to the streets , but are not as effective as investigative programs like Community Shield , which aim to remove gangsters before they commit additional crimes , and to disrupt and dismantle gangs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.52603"}
