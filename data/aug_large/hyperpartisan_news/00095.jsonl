{"text": "After all , not too long ago , Crimea was , in fact , a part of Russia .It was just in 1954 that the Soviet Russian Republic ceded control of Crimea to the Soviet Ukraine Republic via a \" Decree of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet \" that stated it was ... .This is not unlike the transfer of authority for Ellis Island from New York to New Jersey by the Supreme Court .The Soviet leadership certainly did not anticipate that their country would break up and the newly independent Ukraine would scamper off with Crimea .Sixty years later , Crimea is still a predominately Russian community .Seventy - five percent of its population is ethnic Russian .And while the referendum vote last Sunday was rampant with obvious fraud , it is unarguable that a majority of the Crimean residents still associate themselves with Russia .The map below illustrates how segregated the population is .In the blue areas the residents speak Ukrainian .In the red area , virtually all of Crimea , they speak Russian .If there were ever a regional conflict that the United States had little business poking its massive proboscis into , it is this one .It 's fine to take sides rhetorically and even to organize a coalition of nations to advocate on behalf of sovereignty and independence , but rattling the sabers of war over a regional matter that is of no national interest to the U.S. is irresponsible and dangerous .Repeating the mistakes of the previous administration will only cost more American lives without securing anything of value for the loss .Ron Paul , in a disagreement with his senator son Rand , asked the key question saying \" Why does the U.S. care which flag will be hoisted on a small piece of land thousands of miles away ? \" The hypocrites who assert that Obama 's foreign policy is responsible for inviting Putin 's aggression fail to recognize that Putin has never looked to the U.S. for permission to embark on his military misadventures .If that were true , those conservative critics would need to explain what it was about George W. Bush 's foreign policy that invited Putin to invade Georgia .Was he also weak and ineffectual , even after invading and overthrowing the governments of two nations ( including Iraq , never did anything to threaten the U.S. ) ?So what could possibly be the incentive for so many conservative politicians and pundits to so adamantly excoriate the President and advance the cause of war ?The first thing to consider is that Obama 's critics live for chastising him , whether he deserves it or not .They frequently scold him even when he is promoting their ideas .Which is the case with ObamaCare , which was originally a conservative initiative developed by the Heritage Foundation and adopted by folks like Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney .More importantly , there is a thread of Apocalyptic fervor that runs through the ranks of the right .They have an intensity that is rooted in deep faith and a conviction in infallibility that stems from the same source .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.649864"}
