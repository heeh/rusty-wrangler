Gray , warn of a high likelihood that at least one major hurricane , with winds of 111 m.p.h . or more , will make U.S. landfall , which did not happen this year .The 2007 season left an early holiday present for U.S. taxpayers .Not a single major disaster was declared for a hurricane this year , according to Ashley Small , spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency .By contrast , FEMA has committed $ 37.8 billion to cleaning up hurricane damage from the 2005 season - about $ 350 for every U.S. household .The total for 2006 was $ 2.6 billion .Not that the 2007 season was without drama .For the first time on record , two deadly Category 5 hurricanes , with winds over 160 m.p.h . -", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.87274"}

{"text": "Morning satellite image of Irene .Track forecast for Irene The computer models are in agreement that Irene will pass just south of Puerto Rico tonight , then hit the south coast of Hispaniola in the Dominican Republic or Haiti on Monday afternoon .Irene should then emerge into the channel between Haiti and Cuba on Tuesday afternoon , when the storm will have 12 or so hours over water before having to contend with Cuba .A trough of low pressure is expected to move across the Eastern U.S. on Wednesday and Thursday , turning Irene to the northwest and north by Thursday .The timing and strength of this trough varies considerably from model to model , and will be critical in determining where and when Irene will turn to the north .Irene 's strength will also matter -- a stronger Irene is more likely to turn northward earlier .Fay formed just off the coast of Puerto Rico , and was never quite able to get organized enough to become a hurricane , due to passage over Hispaniola and Cuba .Fay topped out as a strong tropical storm with 70 mph winds , and did over $ 500 million in damage in the U.S. , mostly due to flooding rains in Florida that accumulated to over 25 inches in a few areas .Fay also dumped heavy rains on Hispaniola , triggering flooding that claimed eight lives .Intensity forecast for Irene Irene is embedded in a large envelope of moisture now , and wind shear will remain low , 5 - 10 knots , for the next five days .With water temperatures very warm , 28 - 30 \u00b0 C , these conditions should allow for intensification except when land is interfering .Irene 's current appearance on satellite loops gives me the impression of a storm that is not fooling around , and I expect Irene will be a hurricane before hitting Hispaniola on Monday .Passage over Hispaniola will not destroy Irene , since it is a fairly large storm .Once the storm finishes with Hispaniola , it will have to deal with Cuba , which will keep Irene from intensifying significantly .Once Irene pops off the coast of Cuba Wednesday or Thursday into the Florida Straits , Irene will likely be a tropical storm .If the storm then has at least a day over water before hitting land , it will likely become a hurricane again , and could become a major hurricane if it ends up missing South Florida and moving over the warm waters on either side of the Florida Peninsula .Harvey hits Belize Tropical Storm Harvey made landfall at 2 pm EDT on Saturday near Dangriga Town , Belize , as a tropical storm with 60 mph winds .Harvey continues to dump very heavy rains on southern Mexico , but dissipation is expected tonight as the storm pushes inland .Harvey was a small storm , and the strongest winds were confined to a short stretch of coast near where the center came ashore .Winds at Belize City , Belize on Saturday topped out at 15 mph .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.1043"}

''We have n't had any reports of people at the main emergency shelter , but I do n't know how many moved in with their families , ' ' she told The Associated Press .There 's no major damage so far - the occasional power line outage but the winds are picking up , ' ' she said .At 11 a.m. , Gert 's center was about 135 miles east - southeast of Bermuda and moving north at about 13 mph .Winds near 110 mph extended up to 140 miles from the storm 's center .Storm surges of up to 5 feet were projected for Bermuda , but the storm was expected to weaken and turn gradually to the north - northeast , the hurricane center said .On Monday , police warned people in low - lying areas to evacuate their homes and two schools were turned into emergency shelters .Islanders stocked up on emergency supplies .Gert is the biggest storm to threaten Bermuda since 1987 , when Hurricane Emily hit , moved offshore , and then struck again .Cruise ships diverted to other ports and several flights were canceled Monday .Hundreds of tourists fled before the airport closed Tuesday and an already struggling tourist industry began counting the cost of cancellations from its biggest market - the United States .We 've lost business , including group bookings , particularly after the progress of the hurricane was broadcast on U.S. networks , ' ' said Norm Masilar , general manager of the island 's biggest hotel , the Southampton Princess .Earlier in the week , Gert had top winds of up to 145 mph , making the system the fourth Category 4 storm of the Atlantic hurricane season .AP - NY-09 - 21 - 99 1151EDT .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.582794"}
