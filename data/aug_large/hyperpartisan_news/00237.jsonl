' 'But if his rhetoric was combative , there was little to back it up .That is in part down to Ukraine 's relative helplessness and its stated desire to refrain from aggression , but is also a reflection of what authorities see as Moscow 's inflated demands .Rejecting international condemnation , Russian President Vladimir Putin cast his government 's actions as the righting of historic injustices .\" They are demanding to change the constitution , to change the system , to give up Crimea .This is the language of an aggressor ... this is the language of Josef Stalin , ' ' said Oleksiy Haran , a politics professor at the University of Kiev - Mohyla Academy . \" Ukraine has done everything which it can .We resisted from violence , which again the West demanded from us .We did n't kill any Russian soldiers .

{"text": "So we are divided .Division is dangerous because one faction will oppress the other : peasants against landowners ; Protestants against Catholics ; whites against blacks ( this last , of course , Madison was blind to ) .This oppression is a crime against liberty , of course ; but Madison also thinks it will compromise the very stability oppressors are often trying to protect .Madison notes that divided democracies end unhappily : They \" have in general been as short in their lives , as they have been violent in their deaths . \"As John Jay wrote in Federalist 5 , America has as many divisions as the next country .So , how can we avoid a similar fate ?Here Madison introduces a new thesis in political philosophy : Bigger is better .Bigger is better largely because it is harder for individual voices to be heard .A large republic - and already some Americans saw America 's westward destiny would make it a very large republic - will make forming a faction a difficult enterprise .For every new representative in Congress , a new set of competing interests is brought to the table .Madison hoped to make forming permanent factions impossible , as coalitions constantly broke and re - formed in response to a new set of issues .Just as important , national representatives are accountable to larger audiences .Where a state assemblyman might answer to just 57,000 people today [ 3 ] ( and perhaps just a few thousand in Madison 's day ) , Senators and Representatives must answer to whole cities or states .Statewide politicians ca n't be seen to favor any group too much - or , presumably , a new politician will come along and put together a \" coalition of the oppressed \" .Gaius Gracchus , one of the Roman \" tribunes of the people , \" whose appeals to the peoples ' will disrupted the Roman republican system .Madison also notes , in passing , that it 's \" more difficult for unworthy candidates to practise with success the vicious arts \" on a statewide scale .By this he presumably means vote - buying , intimidation , ballot box - stuffing , and all the other unpleasant things characteristic of a second - rate democracy .More citizens means more people to bribe .A large republic , in fact , enjoys the same benefits over a small republic as a republic does over a \" democracy \" .The Founders were very afraid of democracy , by which they meant simple majority rule .Democracies were too easily swayed by gifted speakers ; too likely to suddenly turn vicious and attack their own members ; too changeable and unstable .Republicanism is a filter on the people ; Madison argues that a large republic compounds the benefits of republicanism , by further isolating politicians from factions and populism .With this clever comparison , Madison seals his argument .His contemporaries adored republics , and loathed democracies .If a large republic had the same virtues as republicanism itself - stability , respect for minorities , wise leadership - than America would be a large republic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.877075"}

Huntington , whose exemplary scholarly life came to an end this past Christmas Eve .One of the reasons that his ideas are both great and consequential is that he did not adhere to the conventional liberal and progressive ones .Rather , Huntington sought to create a distinctive kind of American conservatism , one that would recognize the energy and even the value of traditional American liberalism and self - advancement , but would guide that energy into paths of realism and self - restraint .In this way , American conservatism could enable American liberalism to conserve itself .Most consequentially , given the great international challenges the United States has faced in the past century , it could help America to conserve itself in a world filled with non - liberal and even anti - liberal ideas and powers .Samuel Huntington spent most of his life and did most of his work in places where conservatives are rarely found and where conservatives rarely look .Indeed , those places - New England , Harvard University , the American Political Science Association ( APSA ) , and the Democratic Party - have been centers of liberalism and progressivism for most of the past century .Yet it was by being in this liberal world , while not really being of it , that Huntington developed a kind of American conservatism that was particularly tempered and resilient , strong and solid , and consistent and enduring .Throughout his scholarly life , he was an inspiring model of intellectual courage .Huntington 's career began in the early 1950s with a number of innovative and definitive articles on American politics , including a seminal piece on American conservatism .Then , for half a century from the publication of The Soldier and the State ( Harvard University Press , 1956 ) to the publication of Who Are We ?The Challenges to America 's National Identity ( Simon and Schuster , 2004 ) , he produced a series of great books ( in this essay , we will discuss six ) , roughly one in every decade .Each developed a distinctive conservative position on an important political challenge and policy issue of its time , but also of today .Each was met with a chorus of liberal criticism , but each became the center of the intellectual debate on its topic , a lion in the path that every other serious scholar had to confront .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.13716"}

Calhoun and Henry Clay , as well as Federalist Daniel Webster .Madison signed it into law in 1816 and appointed William Jones as its president .War of 1812 .British insults continued , especially the practice of using the Royal Navy to intercept unarmed American merchant ships and \" impress \" ( conscript ) all sailors who might be British subjects for service in the British navy .Madison 's protests were ignored , so he helped stir up public opinion in the west and south for war .One argument was that an American invasion of Canada ( that is , modern Ontario ) would be easy and would provide a good bargaining chip .( Since 1940 American and Canadian historians have agreed that Americans did not desire to acquire Canadian lands , but to stop British aid to the hostile Indians . )Madison carefully prepared public opinion for what everyone at the time called \" Mr. Madison 's War \" , but failed to build up the army , navy , forts , and state militias .After he convinced Congress to declare war , Madison was re - elected President over DeWitt Clinton but by a smaller margin than in 1808 .Historians in 2006 ranked Madison 's failure to avoid war as the sixth worst presidential mistake ever made .[ 13 ] .In the ensuing War of 1812 , the British and their Indian allies won numerous victories , including the capture of Detroit after the American general there surrendered to a smaller force without a fight , and a British raid burned the White House .The British alliance with the western Indians proved a failure , as the Battle of Lake Erie in 1813 secured American control of the west , Tecumseh was killed , and his Indian coalition destroyed at the Battle of the Thames .A standoff was reached on the Canadian border , as Americans controlled Lake Erie and the British controlled Lake Ontario after a ship - building race .The British sent a major invasion force into New York but Americans sank the supporting fleet and the British retreated to Canada in 1814 .At sea , the British blockaded the entire American coastline , cutting off both foreign trade and domestic trade between ports .Economic hardship was severe in New England , but entrepreneurs built factories that soon became the basis of the industrial revolution in America .Madison faced formidable obstacles -- a divided cabinet , a factious party , a recalcitrant Congress , obstructionist governors , and amazingly incompetent generals , together with militia who refused to fight outside their states .Most serious was lack of unified popular support .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.54523"}

Huntington was a builder of the transcontinental railroad .In the twentieth century , Samuel P.

Wade decision , which legalized abortions in the first two trimesters of pregnancy .Yet , these stories would not begin to be told until the last third of the twentieth century .Two historical developments changed Texas scholarship on race and gender in the 1970s .First of all , in the 1960s Gov. John Connally and Lt .Gov. Ben Barnes successfully lobbied the Legislature to substantially increase university budgets , arguing this was needed to maintain the state 's economic competitiveness .The pair hiked university and college faculty salaries , attracting more academic talent from out of state , improved and expanded the state 's community colleges , added the University of Houston to the state system and turned Angelo State College and Pan American College into a four - year schools .In addition to an upgrade of the state 's higher education system , the women 's movement and the African American and Mexican American civil rights movement successfully battled to desegregate and break down gender barriers at Texas colleges and universities .This created a pressure for more inclusive scholarship and diverse faculties , which in turn produced more sensitive and imaginative scholarship .Secondly , a new generation of race and gender scholars tapped into the revisionist zeitgeist of the 1960s , including Lawrence D. Rice , Alwyn Barr , Cary D. Wintz , James M. SoRelle , Arnoldo de Le\u00f3n , David Montejano and Randolph Campbell .These scholars opened the first serious examination of black and Tejano history in Texas .Most of these pioneering works in the 1970s and 1980s aimed at establishing a non - racist narrative , to provide the life stories of prominent Latinos and African Americans , to note their contributions to Texas society and to document their struggles against slavery , segregation and racial violence .These scholars expanded on what constituted history and on who could be considered historical actors .These concerns shaped race and gender historiography in the last 20 years and clearly informed the most nuanced work ever on the role racial ideology played in Texas politics : Chandler Davidson 's \" Race and Class in Texas Politics , \" published in 1990 .Beginning with Dwight Eisenhower 's two presidential campaigns against liberal , pro - civil rights Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson , Davidson argues , the segregationist leadership of the Texas Democratic Party began ticket - splitting , voting Republican in presidential races and for conservative Democrats in local races .Right - wing Democrats crossed the Rubicon and became Republicans in the 1970s and 1980s as the Democratic Party became an unstable coalition of African Americans , Mexican Americans , and left - of - center whites .Davidson argued that the ascendant Republican Party in Texas benefited from instigating Anglo resentments over issues like affirmative action and illegal immigration .According to Davidson , race became the grammar by which Texans engaged in political conflict .These writers provided an alternative vision of Texas history , one no longer monochromatic .Even as a new generation of scholars launched exploration of Afro - Texan , Tejano and women 's history , a new theoretical framework fragmented the study of race and gender in the 1990s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.360565"}

Austin : History and Memory in Progressive - Era Texas , \" by the early twentieth century elite Texas Progressives embraced a Western , as opposed to Southern , identity for the Lone Star State .The cowboy image served an economic purpose .Linking Texas identity with the Confederacy meant tying the Lone Star State to the \" Lost Cause , \" a past redolent of defeat , nostalgia and sleepy rural rhythms .In contrast , the Progressives who came to dominate Texas politics in the early twentieth century wanted to attract outside investment by linking the state with a more triumphant , Western narrative of bold , independent mavericks conquering an untamed frontier .Free - spirited and independent cowboys gradually displaced defeated soldiers in grey in the state 's mythology .The ideas Big Tex embodied rested on racist foundations .The West stood for triumph , which in the Anglo mind meant the victory of superior whites over Mexican and Indian barbarians .Meanwhile , by the time Big Tex arose over the Fair Park landscape , the state 's historians , primarily from the University of Texas at Austin , had driven Mexican Americans and African Americans to the margins of the master narrative .In both popular culture and the state 's scholarship , Texas heroes remained monochromatic until the 1970s .Just as significant as his Western ( as opposed to a Southern ) identity , Big Tex was white , not black or brown , and a man , not a woman .Texas boosters and even historians saw the state 's history as a clash of civilizations , providing intellectual cover for segregation and other racially discriminatory policies in Texas , a viewpoint that has still not completely disappeared .As a state icon , Big Tex obviously failed to capture the ethnic diversity and economic complexities of the Lone Star state , let alone the fact that the image ignored the importance of women .This essay discusses how scholarly apartheid placed white men at the center of Texas ' historical narrative , why a more diverse narrative took so long to develop and what has happened in the last two decades to create a more sophisticated understanding of the state 's past .The politics of racial identity and historical memory , the influence of postmodernism and \" whiteness studies , \" as well as new approaches to examining gender , will be considered along the way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "124.877335"}
