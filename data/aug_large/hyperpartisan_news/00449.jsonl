{"text": "Push Obama to Expand Deferred Action .Barack Obama won re - election yesterday .His actions on immigration in his first four years were indefensible and extremely anti - immigrant .Nonetheless , he did do one thing that concretely benefited immigrants : Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) .Now that the election is over , immigration reform advocates must push the Obama Administration to depoliticize DACA and expand it to 1 . eliminate any residency requirement ; 2 . include children who entered the United States before the age of 18 ; and 3 . carve out exceptions to the education requirement for exceptional circumstances that made it difficult to attend school in the United States .DACA IS ARBITRARILY RESTRICTIVE .\u00c2 DACA in its current form is arbitrarily restrictive .Many support DACA and the Dream Act because the undocumented beneficiaries were brought to the United States as children and therefore can not be held responsible for immigration law violations .First .To qualify for DACA , an individual must have entered the United States prior to reaching the age of 16 .Any child who entered after turning 16 is rendered ineligible for DACA .That means that thousands of 16 and 17-year - old undocumented children are left undocumented for no discernible reason .The 15 and under requirement penalizes many 16 and 17-year - olds because their parents thought it more prudent to smuggle them into the United States at a more mature age .Alternatively , many 16 and 17-year - olds came the United States to escape violence in their homelands yet are not eligible for political asylum .The only substantive argument to exclude 16 and 17-year - olds from DACA is that they are more responsible for their transgressions given their older age .Given that so many of these children came to the United States\u00c2 out of necessity , the apportionment of responsibility for the violation of the immigration law becomes substantially undermined .Regardless of the reasoning behind a 16 - 17 year old violation of the immigration law , the rationale behind the argument to exclude them from DACA seems more political than substantive .Second .\u00c2 An individual must have entered the United States on or before June 15 , 2007 .That means that any undocumented child who entered after the date of June 15 , 2007 is destined to remain undocumented for no\u00c2 discernible\u00c2 reason .This 5 year residency requirement is arbitrary when applied those who were brought to the United States as children .Other residency requirements in Immigration Law , such as the 10-year requirement for nonlpr cancellation of removal , are grounded in the fact that the more time one has resided in the United States , the more equities one has gained .The law does not explicitly spell it out , but the rationale behind residency requirements is implicit : the more time one has been in the U.S. , the more one 's violation of the immigration law is mitigated .Given that one of DACA 's main rationales for being is that its beneficiaries can not be held responsible for immigration law violations , \u00c2 the 5 year residency requirement can not be justified by stating it \" mitigates the child 's immigration law violation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.283516"}
