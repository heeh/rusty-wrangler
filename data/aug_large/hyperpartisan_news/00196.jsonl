{"text": "Speaking of Tuesday 's vote , here are some thoughts : . \"That Was Close ! \"- Okay , President Obama won with 323 Electoral College votes to Mitt Romney 's 206 .The President also won the popular vote by about 3.2 million votes .But , it looks like more of a blowout than it really was .Consider this : Obama 's margin of victory was actually only 333,000 votes .Where do I get that number ?Well , if Romney had won just four more states - Florida , Virginia , Ohio and New Hampshire - he would have had 270 Electoral votes and would be President - elect .To win those states , he would have needed just 333,000 votes distributed proportionally .That 's just shy of .4 percent of all votes cast .The GOP can survive this election ; it just needs to find more votes in certain parts of the landscape .\" The Latin Beat \" - As I just pointed out , Republicans were within striking distance of winning this election , so where did they go wrong ?The biggest mistake was picking Paul Ryan for VP .Senator Marco Rubio ( R - FL ) would have had much greater appeal to Hispanic voters , and he probably could have given Romney the margin of victory needed among voters in Florida , Virginia , Ohio and Colorado .At the same time , Rubio has the same conservative credentials as Ryan , so the party base would have been secured .Ryan 's job was to win Wisconsin , Iowa and Ohio for the GOP ticket , but he won none of them .Nationally , President Obama won 71 % of the Hispanic vote .The end wo n't be so dramatic this time , because both Democrats and Republicans are too politically savvy ( notice I did not say \" smart \" ) to let it happen .Republicans will likely concede tax increases for upper income groups , but I bet they negotiate the tax increase to people making over $ 400,000 per year , instead of the current $ 250,000 that Democrats want .It 's compromise time , and I predict they 'll pass something . \"A Taxing Issue \" - As mentioned above , I believe Congressional Republicans will likely agree to some income tax increases for people making $ 250,000 per year , or perhaps the higher threshold of $ 400,000 .How many people would that affect ?Fewer than 3 percent of Americans make $ 250,000 per year .Approximately 1.3 percent make $ 400,000 per year .( We note that both groups already pay a disproportionately higher share of income tax than any other groups in America . )Republicans had a chance to sign off on ending the Bush tax cuts for those earning above $ 250,000 earlier this year , but were opposed .They got hammered on it .Had they negotiated and perhaps agreed on a $ 400,000 threshold , they might have neutralized the \" class warfare \" issue in this election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.41576"}

Denny Rehberg started out the race about 1 % ahead in the polls .Now , $ 50 million later , they 're in the exact same place -- a 1 % differential between them .Massachusetts : Going into Election Day , Republican strategists were pessimistic about holding onto this red seat in the traditionally blue state .GOP Sen. Scott Brown had fallen behind his well - funded Democratic challenger , Elizabeth Warren -- a liberal icon who was the president 's former consumer advocate .Brown 's win in the race to fill the late Ted Kennedy 's seat stunned the political world , and he insists he 'll surprise everyone again .But the president is expected to take Massachusetts by double digits -- and with him at the top of the ticket , it may be hard for Brown to beat back a Warren win .Borger : How will the white vs. nonwhite vote split .One important indicator I will be looking at Election Night is the question of ethnicity -- and how the white vs. the nonwhite population splits .In the 2008 election , 74 % of the electorate was white .That percentage has declined recently because of the growth in the Hispanic and voting African - American population .Given the ongoing Republican trouble with Hispanic voters and the assumption that African - Americans will , once again , vote overwhelmingly for the president , Romney needs a strong white turnout to help propel him to victory .In an analysis by Republican pollster Bill McInturff , the question of the white / nonwhite divide is called the most \" critical \" of the election .His analysis shows that if the white percentage of the electorate drops to 72 % , Obama will probably win the election .One key to watch is how the white vote itself splits between Obama and Romney .In the latest national poll CNN / ORC International , taken from Friday to Sunday , Obama received 40 % of the white vote , while Romney got 57 % .In 2008 , Obama received 43 % of the white vote , which means he is polling less than that currently .Crowley : Virginia suburbs and I-4 corridor .The first thing I 'll watch is the exit polls to see who 's voting and where -- in particular , heavy Latino turnout in Colorado , Nevada , Virginia and Florida could indicate Obama wins those states .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.84826"}

{"text": "So what went wrong ?The Washington Post exit poll had a D +6 result .Here 's how the GOTV and turnout would relate - effective GOTV would increase your party 's share of the total number of voters : .D +0 /R+1 : If GOP had great turnout and Dems did not .D +3 : If GOP and Dems had equally good turnout .D +6 : If GOP had lesser turnout and Dems did a great job .CONCLUSION :Democrats had a great GOTV Operation and the GOP did not !He failed to close the deal .Romney campaign had a lot of enthusiasm at rallies but they failed to do the GOTV and do the real ground game that would have made this an R+1 election and a victory for our side .Update : Now , after the fact , we are learning more about the problems in the Romney campaign that caused GOTV to be weak .One was the disaster known as Orca : .So , the end result was that 30,000 + of the most active and fired - up volunteers were wandering around confused and frustrated when they could have been doing anything else to help .Like driving people to the polls , phone - banking , walking door - to - door , etc .We lost by fairly small margins in Florida , Virginia , Ohio and Colorado .If this had worked could it have closed the gap ?I sure hope not for my sanity 's sake .COMMENTS .Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES Well this will be ... interesting .Sure .Let 's use that word .It should be interesting .This is a live feed from the Trump HQ where you 'll be able to watch .It is dropping in and out a bit but will hopefully be solid once the speech begins .That 's the live feed .Of the headquarters for Donald Trump .Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES The polls are closed in New Hampshire .Well ... mostly closed .But already MSNBC has called it for Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton .And for Republicans ...Donald Trump .React accordingly .We await what will surely be one of the most ... interesting victory speeches maybe in Republican Primary history .Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES The lines in New Hampshire are crazy .And it seems that some polling places will be staying open late to accommodate them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.55939"}
