{"text": "Manufacturing in America embraces many different sectors of production , and one of the largest and most important is the food processing industry .Here , we have seen the Mexican government impose tariffs of 10 - 20 percent on products like chocolate , ketchup , chewing gum and cheese - all products of the manufacturing sector , made in American factories by American workers .At the same time , we see new tariffs imposed on other manufactured goods , including industrial polishes , adhesives , trench diggers , rubber gloves , floor coverings , stainless steel containers , and gas masks .Mexican school children will be paying more for their education this fall , given that printed exercise books , paints , ballpoint pens and pencils are on the list , facing 15 percent duties .All in all , it 's a cornucopia of American - made products facing punitive tariffs in Mexico this week .Not just manufacturing but farmers will feel the pain as well - the significant addition of pork , apples , oranges , sweet corn and grapefruits total well over $ 700 million in U.S. exports .But manufactured goods are hit , and hit hard .And hit just as hard are the American factory workers who make these products - most of which have a significant export market in Mexico , our second largest trading partner .It 's past time to fix this problem and get our goods moving back over the border that we made duty - free in 1994 with NAFTA .Mexico will impose import tariffs on some U.S. pork cuts , ketchup , cheeses , sweetcorn and some fruits because of the U.S. government 's failure to restore a program allowing Mexican trucks to operate north of the border , the nation 's official gazette said .The list includes a tariff of 5 percent on some cuts of pork and as much as 25 percent on fresh white cheese , according to the notice .Onions , apples , pears , oranges , cherries , soy sauce , mineral water and sunglasses are also on the list .Surprisingly , this week 's hot issue of retaliatory tariffs imposed by Mexico against U.S. farmers and manufacturers appears not to have been mentioned during the President 's trip to Seattle on Tuesday .At least the issue does not appear in any of the public comments .Washington State agricultural producers have lost millions of dollars worth of sales because of Mexico 's tariffs against U.S. products imposed in retaliation for U.S. refusal to establish the cross - border trucking program required by NAFTA .Sen. Patty Murray ( D - WA ) , for whom President Obama raised campaign funds on Tuesday , is leading the Congressional call for resolving the dispute .Commerce Secretary Gary Locke , the former Governor of Washington , was also on hand .The President is expected to highlight export issues in Seattle today when he speaks with small business owners at 11:40 a.m. and then makes a statement to the press .( White House schedule . )We 'd be very surprised if he does not comment on Mexico 's announcement Monday of retaliatory tariffs being imposed on additional U.S. products because the United States is violating NAFTA provisions requiring regulated cross - border trucking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.271835"}
