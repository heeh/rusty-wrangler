Camp introduced this plan on November 6 , 2009 , and Minority Leader Boehner offered the same language as the so - called House leadership alternative to the Democratic proposal in during floor debate in mid - November .Boehner has since signaled that he would like to replace the law with this plan .In short , the plan has all the main ingredients of the conservative approach to health care reform : it shifts the costs and risks of insurance onto individuals , and divides the already fragmented insurance market into low - cost plans for the healthy and high - cost insurance for the sick .To insure sicker individuals who are currently uninsured and ca n't find affordable coverage in the unregulated individual market , the bill requires states to establish high - risk pools with the aid of $ 15 billion in federal funding .But like most pools designed to insure very sick and costly beneficiaries , these programs would likely try to control costs by denying coverage for certain chronic conditions .The bill does abolish waiting lists and specifies that the pools must provide at least two coverage options ( one of which must be a high deductible plan with a health savings account ) , but it does not require states to cover all preexisting conditions .Given the limited federal funding and the cap on premiums - they could be set no higher than 150 percent of the state average - this can not be a permanent solution for providing coverage .For Americans moving from group to individual coverage , the legislation eliminates the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requirement of having creditable coverage in the past 18 months to receive individual insurance .Annual or lifetime spending caps are also eliminated and insurers will no longer be able to rescind coverage .But since insurers could still deny coverage for preexisting conditions and charge very different rates based on gender and age , these plans would only be open to healthier and younger Americans who can survive the tedious underwriting process .Under this bill , insurers selling products in the individual health care market will no longer be confined by the consumer protections of a particular state .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.5643"}

'\" People had little incentive to keep doctor visits scarce or seek out new prescriptions or treatments since they were no longer paying the majority of the bill .Over time rates increased as employees demanded more and more coverage for more and more medical expenses .In reality , insurance that was created to protect worker 's health was now being sought to maintain it .This , in turn , brought higher premiums , more expensive research , and a disconnect between prices and consumers that plagues the current healthcare market .The link between individuals and the cost of their health care was effectively severed , leaving little incentive for individuals to be concerned about prices .What was once a good and affordable deal , soon transformed into a structural failure .Public Insurance .Over 27 percent of Americans are covered by taxpayer financed public insurance .These Americans are covered by Medicare , Medicaid , State - Child 's Health Insurance Programs , military health care , and sometimes a combination of these options .Medicare .In order to qualify for Medicare , individuals must be over 65 ( currently ) or be receiving OASDI benefits as a survivor or disabled person .Part B finances co - pay supplements and is funded through general revenue taxes .Part C deals mainly with special supplies and mechanical support and is also funded through general revenues .Part D , which was created in 2003 , covers prescription drug purchases and has the same financing mechanism as parts B and C. .The costs and liabilities of Medicare for taxpayers are expected to skyrocket in the next few decades , which will create a substantial financial burden on the American people .According to the 2009 Medicare Trustees Report , expenditures for the program in 2008 were around $ 468 billion , or 3.2 percent of gross domestic product .The unfunded obligation is estimated to reach $ 13.4 trillion by 2083 .Part D is expected to more than double in cost in less than a decade , while the percentage of GDP constituted by Part B is expected to more than double from 1.28 percent in 2008 to 2.60 percent in 2030 .Since Medicare expenditures are expected to increase faster than workers ' earnings , there is no doubt that if Congress continues to disregard the fiscal reality of Medicare , the American health care system 's demise will eventually provide a bitter reality check .Medicaid .Medicaid , which is run individually by states through federal and local funding , covers about 13.2 percent of people in America .The program deals primarily with single parents with dependents , pregnant women , and those who are living near or in poverty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.00674"}

{"text": "If the White House is able to see its proposals through , it will leave a lasting and positive mark on American social policy .One component of Bush 's reforms is Health Savings Accounts ( HSAs ) .The idea behind HSAs is quite simple .Individuals should be allowed to manage some of their own health - care dollars through accounts they own and control .They should be able to use these funds to pay the costs of out - of - network doctors , diagnostic tests , and other procedures not covered by third - party , catastrophic insurance .The accounts should be tax - free , and should eventually be available for non - medical purposes , letting individuals profit from wise decisions that allow them to reduce their health - care costs .The logic of such accounts is that they bring health incentives in line with market incentives .Right now , because consumers of health care do n't control the dollars with which that care is purchased , they have little incentive to keep expenses down .HSAs provide such an incentive .Some people will respond by seeking information about treatments and health - care providers over the Internet , choosing the options that are most cost - effective .Some may bypass primary - care physicians altogether and directly order their own diagnostic tests or seek online specialist consultations .Others may forgo name - brand drugs in favor of less expensive generic medications , therapeutic substitutes , and over - the - counter drugs .Studies show that , with a modest amount of training , diabetics , asthma patients , and others can manage their own health care and achieve results at least as good as , and at lower cost than , traditional care .The general principle is that people will not choose to spend a dollar on health care unless they get a dollar 's worth of benefit -- and this will place downward pressure on both medical costs and insurance premiums .HSAs were first created along with the prescription - drug entitlement signed into law in 2003 .But their scope was much smaller than what many reformers had hoped for .The president 's proposal would address this deficiency by increasing the amount people can contribute to their HSAs , making HSAs easier to obtain , and giving people incentives to obtain them ( by creating additional benefits that apply only to HSA plans ) .Bush 's reforms also address the question of tax fairness .For a middle - income employee , this tax subsidy means that the government is effectively paying almost half the cost of his insurance -- even as people who buy their own insurance must do so with after - tax dollars .The White House proposal corrects this inequity by allowing individuals who buy their own health plans to deduct insurance premiums from their income taxes .In addition , a tax credit would offset the payroll taxes on income that goes toward premiums .These reforms would mean that employers had no reason to compensate their employees in insurance rather than wages , aside from economies - of - scale or other advantages associated with large purchases .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.65024"}

Wally Herger ( R - CA ) , for example , recently released a so - called repeal - and - replace bill , which would enact a proposal introduced by Rep. Dave Camp ( R - MI ) .Minority leader John Boehner ( R - OH ) also offered this proposal - the \" Common Sense Health Care Reform and Affordability Act\"-as the Republican alternative during last year 's reform debate .The Common Sense proposal would expand so - called high - risk pools rather than ban preexisting condition exclusions .High - risk pools are arrangements that make some degree of coverage available to individuals with preexisting conditions who can not purchase coverage in the individual market .These pools currently cover 200,000 individuals , and often refuse to cover the health problem that makes the enrollee eligible for the high - risk pool in the first place .The Common Sense proposal also would prohibit annual or lifetime limits on health benefits and would limit insurers ' ability to rescind coverage once the policy is in force .Rep. Tom Price ( R - GA ) of the Republican Study Committee employs a similar strategy .In contrast , Sen. Coburn and Rep. Ryan would enable health plans to continue using annual and lifetime limits , and continue policy rescissions , but would ban exclusions for preexisting conditions .Sen. Gregg would also end those exclusions and annual and lifetime benefit limits , but he does not address rescissions .None of the conservative proposals restrict rate - setting practices .This means insurers can charge people with chronic illnesses and other preexisting conditions exorbitant rates .In sum , none of these proposals takes a comprehensive approach to reforming the individual insurance market , which means Americans who must turn to this market for health insurance will face some combination of limited access to coverage , inadequate coverage , and unaffordable premiums .Finally , this move to the individual market would shift a significant portion of health care costs to individuals and families .Insurance policies in the individual market typically carry higher deductibles and co - payments , while covering fewer health care services compared to comprehensive employer - based coverage .Families covered by these skimpier policies must often pay out - of - pocket for uncovered services , and be prepared to lay down significant resources to meet their annual deductible and cost - sharing requirements .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.72389"}

Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) , Sens .Judd Gregg ( R - NH ) , and Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) have all proposed some variation of this idea over the last year .Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich , conservative health policy analyst John Goodman , and Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty have all floated the idea in the national op - ed pages .In addition , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) made a similar proposal during the 2008 presidential campaign .A related concept - often offered in tandem with changing the tax treatment of employer - sponsored coverage - would create new tax breaks for individually purchased health insurance policies .This approach would enable individuals and families who purchase coverage on their own to either receive a refundable tax credit or claim an itemized deduction on their individual income taxes .The actual value of the deduction when translated into reduced tax liability , however , would be significantly smaller .Higher - income families would reduce their taxes by $ 4,025 if they took the maximum possible deduction of $ 11,500 , while families in lower tax brackets would receive a smaller benefit .Both the proposed tax credits and the Gregg deduction fall short when compared to the cost of comprehensive coverage through a group plan , which averaged $ 13,375 in 2009 .So these proposed credits and deductions do not come close to covering the full cost of comprehensive coverage .In addition , the buying power of these credits and deductions would diminish over time , as conservative policymakers typically propose using a growth index that falls well below average growth in health care costs .Sen. Coburn and Rep. Ryan , for example , propose growing their tax credits more than 2 percentage points more slowly than expected growth in health care costs .Finally , a number of conservative policymakers - notably Sens .Gregg and Coburn and Rep. Ryan - propose to move low - income families from Medicaid coverage to the individual market .Under this approach , low - income families would , like other Americans , receive tax credits or other help with purchasing health coverage .This coverage is unlikely to be as comprehensive as the Medicaid benefit package and would entail significant out - of - pocket costs through deductibles , copayments , and uncovered services .These proposals include additional subsidies to these families to help with these costs , but even with this supplement low - income families will face higher health care costs .Moving millions of people out of group coverage and into the individual market raises a number of thorny issues .First , coverage in the individual market is hard to obtain .Except for insurance companies that operate in the handful of states with comprehensive insurance reform , most insurers subject applicants to underwriting tests , examining their health histories in an effort to determine whether they have preexisting conditions and should therefore be denied coverage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.264694"}

Ryan 's legislative language clearly indicates that the disability population would receive vouchers like everyone else , even though the CBO estimate ( based on consultation with his staff ) assumed otherwise .These proposals raise a number of serious issues .Low - income individuals who rely on the Medicaid program for comprehensive health insurance coverage would be forced to move to private plans with more limited coverage and higher out - ofpocket costs .And while the Ryan budget roadmap , for example , would provide current Medicaid enrollees with a higher - than - average subsidy to cover premium costs , the total subsidy , $ 11,000 per year , still falls short of the average premium for comprehensive coverage purchased in the group market .In some cases , these low - income families may not have the ability to make up the difference between the premium and cost - sharing obligations they would face in the individual market and the help offered to them under this proposal .In addition , the buying power of these subsidies will diminish over time because the subsidy amount typically grows more slowly than expected growth in health care costs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.6649"}

Bush has conspicuously failed at the important task of capturing the youth vote .Rather to the contrary .Voters under 30 were the age group least likely to support Bush in 2000 or 2004 .They were the age group least likely to support Republicans when they had a good year in 2002 and when they had a bad year in 2006 .The weakness of Republicans among young voters is one reason -- and , you could argue , the main demographic reason -- that Democrats go into the 2008 campaign as the party more voters would like to see win .Democratic candidates do not always run ahead of Republicans -- Rudy Giuliani has been running ahead of Hillary Clinton in most polls .But if the Republicans are to regain the narrowly held majority status they enjoyed for 10 years ( they got more votes than Democrats in the six House elections from 1994 to 2004 ) , they are going to have to run better among the young .Among other reasons : They are going to go on voting for a lot longer than the rest of us .Bush 's failure to win over young voters was not for lack of trying .His conviction , and Karl Rove 's , was that his proposal for changing Social Security would surely appeal to them .Logically , it should have -- because those in their 20s today have the most to gain from reform .In their report last month , the Social Security trustees told us that Social Security costs will exceed revenues by 2017 .So just 10 years from now , Congress will have to start dipping into other government revenues just to pay off Social Security beneficiaries .By 2041 , when today 's 21-year - old voter will be 55 , Social Security will finance only 75 percent of benefits .The government will have to raise taxes , borrow more or cut other federal spending programs .Changing the system to allow individuals to have personal investment accounts could avoid this crunch .But when Bush 's call for doing that was opposed by Democrats , the response of young voters seemed to be , \" Whatever .\" My sense when I look at what young voters tell pollsters is that they assume that everything is going to be just fine if things roll along pretty much as they are .They have grown up in an era , lasting nearly 25 years now , when we 've had low inflation coupled with economic growth 95 percent of the time .They may grouse about gas prices or paying off college loans , but they 're able to get jobs that mostly pay pretty well and often are more interesting and less backbreaking than the vaunted factory jobs of the past .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.83095"}

Ryan , propose raising the contribution limits for the savings account component of these arrangements or making other changes to make health savings accounts more attractive to potential enrollees .Yet to the degree that health savings accounts induce enrollees to reduce their health care spending , these incentives are focused on the health care people use before they meet their deductible .Because 80 percent of all health care spending is dedicated to only 20 percent of the population , this approach will have little impact on total health care spending .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.56569"}

{"text": "States Lead on Reform .As of September , 2007 , eight states and the cities of New York and San Francisco have either enacted or are proposing to enact some form of health - care coverage reform .In April , 2006 , Massachusetts became the first state to enact a universal health - care coverage plan .Under the plan , businesses are required to pay a premium of $ 295 per employee per year .The law mandates that all firms with 10 or more employees offer coverage and that individuals without health insurance coverage must obtain it from a state - approved firm or face a penalty of $ 1,000 if not enrolled by July 1 , 2007 .Premiums for the plan range from $ 18 to $ 170 per month based on income .In May , 2006 , Vermont enacted its own universal health - care plan .Fed Plan Seeks Tax Parity .At the federal level , President Bush has proposed a plan that seeks to use tax incentives , rather than encouraging or subsidizing the purchase of individual coverage through the current employer - based system .In his January , 2007 , State of the Union address , the President proposed tax deductions for those who currently have no health insurance but who elect to purchase it themselves ( rather than through an employer - sponsored plan ) .He also proposed additional standard deductions of $ 15,000 for families and $ 7,500 for individuals , thereby sheltering those amounts from payroll taxes and allowing the savings to be used to defray the cost of purchasing health insurance .At the same time , under the President 's proposal , employer - provided health insurance would become a taxable benefit : Those receiving health insurance through their jobs would no longer receive a tax advantage on this benefit .The ultimate effect of the proposal would be to equalize the tax treatment between those with self - purchased health insurance coverage and those who participate in employer - sponsored plans .The President 's plan also includes an Affordable Choice Initiative that would help states make basic health insurance available to those who can not afford it , by redirecting subsidies for hospitals that care for the poor to state insurance pools .Congress Seeks to Expand SCHIP .As they move toward universal coverage , politicians from both sides of the aisle have felt the pressure to continue extending coverage to uninsured children .The issue has been which children would qualify for subsidized coverage - and how much it will cost the government .The current legislation would increase the potential number of children to be covered from the current 4 million to an estimated 8 million .Originally enacted by Congress in 1997 , the goal of SCHIP is to increase health insurance coverage for children of low - income Americans .As originally adopted in 1997 , the program provided block grants authorizing $ 40 billion over 10 years to provide health insurance coverage to children whose parents ' incomes were too high to qualify for Medicaid but left them lacking private health insurance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.39479"}

Boehner would be able to find affordable insurance under his own proposal should he choose to give up his government - sponsored plans for his own set of conservative reforms .He is 60 and by virtue of his age is more susceptible to cardiovascular disease , different cancers , high blood pressure , and host of other chronic diseases .The Common Sense proposal would allow insurers to discriminate against these conditions and price the Republican leader out of the market .Specifically , Rep. Boehner : .Would not find coverage in the individual market .The Common Sense proposal aims to increase access to coverage in the individual market by giving individuals the opportunity to purchase insurance licensed in different states .Would not find adequate coverage in high - risk pools .When Rep. Boehner is denied coverage in the individual market , he could apply for insurance in expanded state - based high - risk pools , which typically provide very expensive coverage for the so - called \" uninsurables .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.937195"}
{"text": "[ 8 ] .As noted , the underlying cost of health care in Massachusetts is very expensive .This reflects the prevailing level of high wages in the state , the prevailing and expensive patterns of medical practice , and the relatively uncompetitive hospital market .These factors are aggravated by a level of government regulation over health care plans , such as 43 benefit and provider mandates , that is clearly excessive .[ 9 ] .The Massachusetts legislature also standardized benefit coverage for all citizens enrolled in the Commonwealth Care plan -- that is , those who earn below 300 percent of the federal poverty level and are eligible for government assistance to purchase health coverage through the Connector .[ 10 ] The Commonwealth Care program is administered by the board of the Connector .Outside of Commonwealth Care , insurers have more flexibility in structuring benefits for plans sold to non - subsidized individuals through the Connector .The \" seal of approval , \" or certification provision , adds another layer of regulatory approval for insurers seeking to offer coverage through the Connector on top of the provisions of state insurance law applied by the state 's Department of Insurance .States considering similar reforms should avoid this duplicative feature in their reform designs .At the same time , states should modify their basic health insurance laws as part of any broader health reform legislation that establishes a state health insurance exchange .[11 ] Blocking health plan entry , in any way , directly compromises the basic intent of a health insurance exchange and , thus , the efficiency of a market based on consumer choice and competition .Regulatory Overreach .Likewise , the Massachusetts Connector board 's authority to set a \" minimum creditable coverage \" standard for what constitutes acceptable coverage under the state 's individual mandate is also problematic .Given the peculiar political culture of Massachusetts , this arrangement reflects the need to resolve the inherent conflict in the legislature 's insistence that coverage be affordable and comprehensive .The result is that \" affordable \" coverage options are more expensive because they include more regulatory requirements for coverage .For example , the Connector board has recently started making decisions concerning the minimum level of drug coverage and lifetime caps on insurance , standards that are incompatible with plan offerings already marketed in the state .This new \" minimum creditable coverage \" standard could affect the existing insurance coverage of an estimated 200,000 Massachusetts residents , eventually making them pay more than they would otherwise .This number includes an estimated 90 percent of employees in union - managed plans .[ 12 ] In coping with this latest regulatory wrinkle , the Connector 's board has recently agreed to grandfather in existing employer - based plans until 2009 .Nonetheless , the latest set of rules includes nine provisions governing benefits , ranging from determinations of the acceptable level of preventive care to deductible levels for drug coverage .As Massachusetts 's experience demonstrates , health policy is riddled with unintended consequences .They can be costly , both economically and politically .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.37976"}

{"text": "It 's a valid point , the general public is not at all interested in seeing the population increase , but at the same time I would say that I believe that overpopulation is a myth .I would also point out these two parts from the article specifically related to America .... .On the other hand , in places like the United States , jus soli is credited with the nation 's ability to integrate various nationalities and with much less social strife and difficulties than other countries [ citation needed].Although jus soli was formally stated in the Fourteenth Amendment , judicial authorities recognize that the philosophy was integral at the conception of the country 's constitution .The 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution reads , in pertinent part , \" All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside .\" At the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified ( 1868 ) , it excluded Aboriginal Americans because they were not considered subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and , thus , were not American citizens .Congress declared it policy to extend citizenship to all Aboriginal peoples in 1924 , which was realized in 1968 with the Indian Civil Rights Act .[ 9 ] .This interpretation of \" subject to the jurisdiction \" of the United States was formally established in 1898 by a 6 - 2 decision the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark 169 U.S. 649 ( 1898 ) .In that case , the Court found the petitioner had been born in the United States and therefore became a U.S. citizen .This could not be revoked because his parents were not American citizens at the time of his birth , or because they made several trips to China after it .[ 10 ] .Nevertheless , some lawmakers and conservative activists have proposed abolishing jus soli,[2][11 ] but these efforts have so far failed .He 's probably out protesting about it on somebody 's lawn .He 's wearing flak jacket in case you decide to run over & shoot him in the back like a coward while he peacefully walks away after traumatizing your child .The children who are born in other countries are citizens of that country .Children who are born here are citizens of this country by birthright , and to strip them of that would essentially leave them in limbo .None of us have a choice of our parents or where we are born .The babies are innocent in this , as are the young children who get brought over illegally by their parents .Still , the fact remains that while it may seem odd to some extent to say that it 's as black and white as the state lines themselves , I believe it is .Children born here can be citizens by birthright , Children who are not need to become naturalized through the immigration process .They should n't have to change the law at all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.7404"}
