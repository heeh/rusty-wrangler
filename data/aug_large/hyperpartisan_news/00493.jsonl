Williams , who had fled the U.S. by the time the New Left really kicked off but who was an influence on some people in Black Power circle .He was n't a response to the supposed failures of the old left and if anyone was doing something it makes sense to call identity politics , then I think he was .I think the \" the old left did n't care about race and gender \" line is at least as much a product of how the new left talked about the old left as it 's a result of what the old left actually did .Biffard Misqueegan wrote : .If one views racism as something that is independent of class society and capital ( and therefore something that can be rectified within capitalist society ) , they will approach the issue very differently than somebody who sees identity as historically tied to the social structures of bourgeois society .I 'm not sure I agree with that .I do think different forms of oppression are at least relatively autonomous from capitalism and maybe absolutely autonomous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.9258"}
{"text": "So yeah , wholeheartedly agree with this : .Eve Mitchell wrote : . while intersectionality theorists have rightly identified an objective problem , these divisions and antagonisms within the class must be address materially through struggle .Simply reducing this struggle to mere quantity , equality of distribution , or \" representation , \" reinforces identity as a static , naturalized category .In this sense there 's a dual struggle .The struggle itself , and the simultaneous struggle to define the universal ( i.e. the goals and methods which unite people in struggle ) , which defaults to white , masculine , heterosexual interests ( think rapists on the central committee for a very clear example ) .That is to say the counter to the politics of representation is a politics of self - activity , out of which a universal interest can emerge ( rather than existing timelessly and objectively to be discerned by intellectual vanguards ) .Weirdly though , most of the intersectionalists i 've encountered would fall on the latter side of that split .Perhaps they 're closer to an autonomist Marxism in practice , and just have n't shed the intersectional vocab .Most , if not all , intersectional theorists DO concieve of race and gender as fluid , historically contingent categories , shaped by ( and shaping ) capitalist relations .And , as Joseph Kay points out , activists who draw on intersectional theory are often the main force behind campaigns such as the ones suggested by the author .Indeed , if Mitchell is not familiar with the work and theory of the Incite !Collective , I would highly recommend their books to her .So . while Mitchell 's criticisms do apply to the way identity politics is practised on occasion , I do n't think her article invalidates any of the really good intersectional theory I 've read , including that of Patricia Hill Collins or bell hooks .Fundamentally , all intersectional theorists are arguing is that capitalism , racism and sexism are mutually constitutive , and can not be understood , or resisted , separately .I 've read the piece and I do n't understand what ' identity politics ' is supposed to mean here other than that is has something to do with how people identify themselves .I think it 'd probably help if people talked about particular instances of what they take to be ' identity politics ' rather than talking about ' identity politics ' as such .I mean , ' marxism ' is a huge vague term covering massive disagreements .I would bet that ' identity politics ' is too .I also think it 's a little weird to dismiss identity claims while being like \" reject that stuff and instead check out what we marxists think \" because marxism ( or rather , marxist ) is in a way a kind of identity .Ditto ' feminist ' .I also think the attribution of identity ( and reduction of people to one - sided categories ) to capitalism is probably wrong .Either way I 'd be interested in seeing it empirically supported , rather than via theoretical appeals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.41912"}

{"text": "In the movement from feudalism to capitalism , the gendered division of labor , and therefore gender relations within the class began to take a new form that corresponded to the needs of capital .Some of these new relations included the following : .( 1 )The development of the wage .The wage is the capitalist form of coercion .As Maria Mies explains in her book , Patriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale , the wage replaced serf and slave ownership as the method to coerce alienated labor ( meaning labor that the worker does for someone else ) .Under capitalism , those who produce ( workers ) do not own the means of production , so they must go to work for those who own the means of production ( capitalists ) .Workers must therefore sell the only thing they own , their ability to labor , or their labor power , to the capitalist .This is key because workers are not paid for their sensuous living labor , the act of producing , but the ability to labor .The labor - labor power split gives rise to the appearance of an equal exchange of value ; it appears as though the worker is paid for the amount of value she produces but in essence she is paid only for her ability to labor for a given period of time .Furthermore , the working day itself is split into two parts : necessary labor time and surplus labor time .Necessary labor time is the time it takes the worker ( on average ) to produce enough value to buy all the commodities he needs to reproduce himself ( everything from his dinner to his iPhone ) .Surplus labor time is the time the worker works beyond the necessary labor time .Since the going rate for labor power ( again , our capacity to labor - not our actual living labor ) is the value of all the commodities the worker needs to reproduce herself , surplus labor is value that goes straight into the capitalist 's pocket .For example , let 's say I work in a Furby factory .I get paid $ 10 a day to work 10 hours , I produce 10 Furbies a day , and a Furby is worth $ 10 each .So my necessary labor time is 1 hour , and the surplus labor time I give to the capitalist is 9 hours ( 10 - 1 ) .The wage obscures this fact .Recall that under capitalism , it appears as though we are paid the equivalent value of what we produce .But , in essence , we are paid only for our necessary labor time , or the minimum amount we need to reproduce ourselves .This was different under feudalism when it was very clear how much time humans spent working for themselves , and how much time they spent working for someone else .For example , a serf might spend five hours a week tilling the land to produce food for the feudal lord , and the rest of her time was her own .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.445404"}

They cultivated a sense of victimhood powerful enough to be thought to justify any atrocity whatsoever .German nationalism was identity politics par excellence .The same thinking is at play in many of history 's other great horrors : recall , for instance , the Rwandan Genocide , in which the overriding issue was Tutsi Privilege .Or consider the extent to which nationalism , and wounded national pride , is at stake in any war .Meanwhile , many Israelis are blind to the injustices involved in the occupation of Palestine , because a sense of victimhood is felt to be an inoculation against the possibility of wrongdoing .Palestinians are thought of not as victims of oppression , but a powerful existential threat , collectively responsible as a people for every act of anti - Israeli terrorism .But the point of what I 've written here is n't to make another contribution to the world 's continuing cycle of political ressentiment and identity - based dehumanization .I mean to say that in all its forms , it ought to stop : in the short run , it is immoral .In the long run , it is dangerous to everyone .Comments .Excellent , philosophical response to Jarrar 's poorly thought - out article .I 've read this article and various responses because I am a belly dancer .It was posited as a feminist article so it is good to have a well - constructed philosophical response .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.38599"}
