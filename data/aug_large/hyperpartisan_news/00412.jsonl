Sonny Perdue 's reelection campaign , 2004 - 2006 ; Perdue for Governor , 2002 .NEED TO KNOW : Gov. Sonny Perdue was the first Republican reelected to the governorship in Georgia 's history , and Ayers helped him get there .As executive director of the Republican Governors Association for the last four years , Ayers has raised huge amounts of money and won key races , giving the GOP a needed boost when it was down .HOTLINE SAYS :A group of prominent Republicans , including Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , seriously contemplated naming Ayers as their consensus choice .But those talks broke down , and Ayers looks increasingly unlikely to make a bid .At just 28 years old , he 's got plenty of time for a run later in life .Most Popular .The tight grip of oligarchy upon the American political system slipped a little last night in New Hampshire .On the Democratic side , voters cast their ballots for one of the most implausible candidates in modern presidential history - less because his rhetoric was so mesmerizing or his program so inspiring than as a protest against an expected winner perceived as a lavishly compensated servitor of organized wealth .In her concession speech , Hillary Clinton boasted of her small donors .More than 70 percent had given less than $ 100 , she claimed : \" I know that does n't fit with the narrative . \"As Ken Vogel of Politico immediately tweeted , the claim also distorts the facts .Clinton may have a lot of donors , but the bulk of the value of her donations-85 percent - has come from the biggest givers .And her family 's personal wealth , and its foundation 's assets , can also be seen as built on the largesse of banks , corporations , and foreign governments .The number of American teens who excel at advanced math has surged .Why ?O n a sultry evening last July , a tall , soft - spoken 17-year - old named David Stoner and nearly 600 other math whizzes from all over the world sat huddled in small groups around wicker bistro tables , talking in low voices and obsessively refreshing the browsers on their laptops .The air in the cavernous lobby of the Lotus Hotel Pang Suan Kaew in Chiang Mai , Thailand , was humid , recalls Stoner , whose light South Carolina accent warms his carefully chosen words .The tension in the room made it seem especially heavy , like the atmosphere at a high - stakes poker tournament .Stoner and five teammates were representing the United States in the 56th International Mathematical Olympiad .They figured they 'd done pretty well over the two days of competition .God knows , they 'd trained hard .Stoner , like his teammates , had endured a grueling regime for more than a year - practicing tricky problems over breakfast before school and taking on more problems late into the evening after he completed the homework for his college - level math classes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.74198"}
