Roosevelt Library was the only precedent , the Presidential Libraries Act was still not law .The slow process of construction and planning a library meant that Truman 's papers were without a permanent home for years .In January 1953 , most of Truman 's papers were moved in 12 trucks from Washington , DC , to the Jackson County Courthouse in Kansas City , MO , where the archival process of sorting through his papers began .Even after the move , however , the President and First Lady Bess Truman continued to be overwhelmed by the volume of records .Photograph of Harry S. Truman Library , ca .1960 ( National Archives Identifier 12170023 ) .Between April 22 and 24 , 1957 , after almost two and half years in the Memorial Building , the majority of Truman 's papers were moved into the new Truman Library .While the museum opened to the public on September 15 , 1957 , Truman 's Presidential papers could not be accessed until May 11 , 1959-six years and four months after their original move .Still , though many of the White House files were transferred to the National Archives for public use , documents that Truman regarded as his personal papers remained under his control until his death .Photograph of Truman with a School Group at the Harry S.

{"text": "Using absolute terms can be dangerous .But I think it is safe to say that there has never been a time when archivists have had to depend so heavily on non - archivists in order to do our work .We rely on IT professionals to help us ingest electronic record and to help us develop ways of preserving , reviewing , and releasing those records in an electronic format .This presents us with one of the biggest challenges we face .Our Information Technology Office has a strong understanding of what we archivists need .However , working with IT professionals outside of the agency requires that archivists learn to speak their language in order to ensure that the services they provide are the ones we need .So what do we need ?We need to receive the records .But even this seemingly simple task is complex .Transferring records has moved well beyond hardware being passed from creators to archivists .There is the challenge of sheer logistics - there is a certain amount of physics involved just in getting digital content transferred in an appropriate amount of time .Formats also pose challenges , but we need to make sure we capture the data and can preserve it forever .Under the terms of the Presidential Records Act , anything that rises to the level of record is transferred to the Archives as permanent .This obligates us to figure out how to ingest ( or transform appropriately before ingest ) a wide variety of formats being used by the records creators .While we strive to keep up with developments and changes in the ways records are being created , we nonetheless need to analyze formats to determine their suitability for transfer and ingest .Format analysis and planning for export and transfer require a significant amount of attention on the part of archivists and information professionals working on these tasks .Since we strive to preserve and access the data and not the systems , proprietary formats can sometimes prove a challenge to export and ingest .We never want to be in a situation of perpetuating proprietary formats .Search and accessibility challenge us as well .Traditional searches of electronic records will return a word or phrase with 100 % reliability , which can be useful at times .But when you must search common words across a large body of records , say the approximately 200 million emails NARA received from the George W. Bush administration , finding needed documents can become daunting .For instance , Boolean searches are often inadequate for the many subject - based requests received under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act .Taking advantage of strides made in the e - discovery field requires integration with the tools and systems that we do have in order to make search and access as seamless as possible .Technology is key if NARA hopes to be able to review such large volumes of born - electronic records in order to make them available to the public .The challenges of born - digital materials loom large over the archival profession .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.896866"}

{"text": "The items fit into a maroon leather box with blue velvet lining , though this item is not currently on display .Senior Curator of \" Spirited Republic \" Bruce Bustard identified FDR 's cocktail set as one of his favorite items in the exhibit , due both to its elegance and historical richness .Bustard believes that this particular item best highlights the divide in American perceptions regarding alcohol .The cocktail set represents this divide between those as close as husband and wife , or in this case , between President and First Lady .For instance , President Roosevelt held a daily tradition , where he hosted an evening cocktail hour for his closest staff and friends called the \" Children 's Hour .\" Roosevelt most likely used this cocktail set both during his \" Children 's Hour \" throughout his governorship and Presidency .According to daughter Anna Roosevelt Halsted , her father kept the shaker and cups with him in Hyde Park and the White House .Named after Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's poem , \" The Children 's Hour , \" President Roosevelt 's rules for this hour were simple : No formal discussion of politics or government policy , and he mixed the drinks .The President supposedly made strong cocktails , where he experimented with different spirits , including absinthe .The \" Children 's Hour \" played a large role in creating positive associations with the cocktail set for the President .FDR came to look fondly on his cocktail , because it was connected to a time where the President could cast aside the burdens of his office and socialize with friends and associates .Despite the President 's feelings , First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt might have held less - than - positive associations with the silver cocktail set .Eleanor Roosevelt 's father and brother were both alcoholics .When she was young , her father became estranged from the family due to his alcoholism , and later died in a sanitarium after suffering complications from a fall during withdrawals .These experiences with alcoholism pushed the First Lady away from alcohol .While she did not completely abstain from drinking , the amount was minimal .The First Lady viewed her husband 's \" Children 's Hour \" as a waste of time better spent on pressing political matters .She rarely participated in the cocktail hour .Instead , she held time for tea with her associates .She shared her view on the \" Children 's Hour \" with the President in her nightly notes to him .As Bustard noted , an artifact like FDR 's silver cocktail shaker can demonstrate polarizing viewpoints on alcohol consumption .For President Roosevelt , the shaker was a cultural artifact that represented a time of day spent focusing on those closest to you in a less formal setting .To the First Lady , the silver cocktail set symbolized time and resources that could have been better spent effecting change .To see FDR 's cocktail set or learn more about the history of alcohol in America , visit \" Spirited Republic , \" on display through January 10 , 2016 , in the Lawrence F. O'Brien Gallery at the National Archives Building in Washington , DC .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.83241"}

{"text": "It was a significant improvement from the National Origins Act of 1924 , which barred Asian immigrants , limited Latin American immigrants , and established rigid immigration quotas for European countries .These quotas , established in an era of post - World War I isolationism and xenophobia , lasted from 1924 through 1965 : .Italy : 3,845 .Latvia : 142 .Lithuania : 344 .Netherlands : 1,648 .Norway : 6,453 .Poland : 5,962 .Russia : 2,248 .Sweden : 9,561 .Switzerland : 2,081 .Yugoslavia : 671 .Aliens needed to apply for spots on the quota in their country of birth , regardless of where they and their family lived .Some quota waiting lists were a dozen years long , while others were not filled .The Immigration Act of 1965 abolished this quota system and eliminated the formally racial character of immigration to the United States .The act aimed for immigration law to distinguish between hemispheres of origin , instead of discriminating on the basis of ethnicity or race .It also prioritized keeping families together , and put a preference on skilled workers .According to records in the Center for Legislative Archives , the net effect of the final bill was to admit 320,000 people to the United States each year .This number included 120,000 from the Western hemisphere and 170,000 from the rest of the world , as well as 30,000 immediate relatives of U.S. citizens .On August 25 , 1965 , the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill with a vote of 318 - 95 .On September 22 , the U.S. Senate passed it with a vote of 76 - 18 .According to the Congressional Quarterly in October 1965 , a combination of factors enabled its passage : .The Democratic majority in Congress supported the Johnson administration , which viewed quotas as discriminatory .The general public was not as interested in the act as it was in civil rights or health care , and as a result , provided less opposition .Special interest groups were willing to compromise with each other .The National Archives holds many records related to the history of immigration .The Records of Rights exhibit at the National Archives in Washington , DC , includes a compelling section on American immigration .And on September 17 , Constitution Day , the annual naturalization ceremony for new American citizens will take place in front of the Constitution at the National Archives in Washington , DC .Today 's post comes from Meagan Frenzer , graduate research intern for the National Archives History Office in Washington , DC .On display in the \" Spirited Republic : Alcohol in American History \" exhibit at the National Archives in Washington , DC , is a silver cocktail shaker and six cups that once belonged to President Franklin D.
