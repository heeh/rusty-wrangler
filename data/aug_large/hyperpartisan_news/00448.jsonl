{"text": "How could this be ?Because , despite the naysayers , CONSERVATISM WORKS ! WeeklyStandard : In the aftermath of the 2012 election , conservatives / Republicans generally split into two camps about where the movement or party needed to head next .One camp thought the key was to do a better job of making the case for conservative principles and policies ( and to do a better job of developing specific policies consistent with conservative principles ) , especially to Main Street Americans , many of whom are blue - collar voters .This camp was particularly frustrated with Mitt Romney 's failure to fight on the issue of Obamacare or to champion a conservative alternative to it , and it argued that Republicans could n't win national elections without advancing a conservative message that would appeal to the old Reagan Democrats .It blamed the 2012 loss squarely on Romney 's shoulders ( and on the shoulders of those who failed to answer the bell and thus gave Romney an open path to the nomination ) .Apart from these targeted efforts , which largely seemed designed to exonerate Romney and his allies , this camp showed little interest in changing the way Republicans do business .As has been widely reported , Donald Trump 's appeal has mostly been to blue - collar voters , and he has risen to the top of the polls by blasting open - border immigration policies and the business - as - usual way of Republican - and American - politics .It is therefore striking that the Iowa entrance polling suggests that Trump lost among blue - collar voters ( or , more specifically , among voters without college degrees ) to Ted Cruz .According to entrance polling , among the roughly half of all Republican voters without a college degree , Cruz won 30 percent of the vote , eclipsing Trump 's 28 percent .Marco Rubio was a distant third , winning the support of just 17 percent of voters without college degrees .According to the entrance polling , Cruz also fared better than Trump or Rubio among younger voters .Among voters under the age of 30 , Cruz won 26 percent of the vote to Rubio 's 23 percent and Trump 's 20 percent .Among voters in their 30s and early 40s , Cruz won 30 percent of the vote to Trump 's 23 percent and Rubio 's 21 percent .( Meanwhile , on the Democratic side , Hillary Clinton got clobbered among younger voters , winning less than 30 percent of the vote among those under the age of 45 . )Cruz 's strong numbers among blue - collar voters lend credence to his expressed determination , emphasized in his victory speech , to win Reagan Democrats back into the Republican fold .Cruz could certainly do more to appeal to such voters - for example , he could champion a winning Obamacare alternative , a move that would also help convince GOP primary voters that a Cruz nomination could result in an electoral win in 2016 and a huge policy win in 2017 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.12353"}

{"text": "Worse still , in negotiations over his economic plan , Clinton has repeatedly caved in to lobbyists from business and Wall Street .The grand design gradually mutated from one part investment and one part deficit - reduction to a plan designed mainly to calm the money markets and the Federal Reserve .He agreed to House Ways and Means Committee modifications of the energy tax to shift the burden from industry to consumers and to new tax breaks for corporations that take over other corporations .And he virtually gutted his proposal to limit excessive CEO salaries -- a proposal that would not have raised much money , but that would have dramatized Clinton 's opposition to the excesses of wealth .What happened to that proposal is symptomatic of what happened to Clinton 's approach to economic policy .During his campaign and first month in office , Clinton promised to deny tax deductions to firms that awarded their executives salaries over $ 1 million .\" The tax code should no longer subsidize excessive pay of chief executives and other high executives , \" Clinton told business leaders at the White House .He defined \" excessive \" in true populist terms as \" unrelated to the productivity of the enterprise . \"He also cited \" the enormously increased rate of executive compensation in the last 12 years as compared with the compensation of workers .\" But under pressure from the financial community , Clinton quietly backed off .In April , the administration announced a plan that was riddled with loopholes .For instance , CEO stock options would not be included in the $ 1 million limit , and firms could take a deduction on straight salaries over $ 1 million if stockholders approved .Clinton may even botch health care reform .He has railed against drug company profits , but he has oddly cast his political lot with an arguably even less popular component of the health - industrial complex -- the big insurance companies .The risk is that comprehensive health reform will falter in the face of perceived or real budget constraints .And rather than being a reform to secure high - quality health coverage for the working middle class ( progressive populist ) , the eventual bill will parallel other post-1968 reforms that are merely social liberal .It will mildly benefit the poor , enrich the already wealthy , and screw small business and the middle class .In his economic policy , Clinton should have emphasized the distinction -- central to populism and progressivism -- between productive and unproductive labor and between enterprise and speculation .He should have waged a public battle over excessive CEO salaries .In addition , he might have proposed something like a transactions tax on stock speculation to balance some of the tax increases on the middle class .In his health plan , he should have required that insurance companies limit costs and profits .Clinton would be forced to fight for these measures , but it would be the kind of battle that would reaffirm rather than undermine his ties to middle America .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.25863"}

'There 's another two Americas that exist in this country : there 's one for the lobbyists , for the special interests , for the powerful , for the big multinational corporations and there 's another one for everybody else .Well I 'm here to say that their America is over ! \" When he was asked at a press conference whether he was playing up class warfare Edwards responded , \" If you call wanting to give everybody a chance ' class warfare , ' then so be it .That 's what I 'm for .\" Edwards , who wore broken - in jeans during his campaign stops , always sought to establish symbolic ties to the working class .His campaign tour for example was called \" The Road to One America . \"His biggest applause lines on the stump came when he railed against free trade agreements like NAFTA and promised to clamp down on U.S. employers who hired undocumented workers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.821396"}

Bush 's Cabinet .Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have been widely praised for engineering the Wall Street bailouts , which avoided systemic chaos , and they 'll probably get more plaudits if the government recovers much of the $ 400 billion in loans it made to financial institutions .In his eight years as Goldman 's chief executive , Paulson had presided over the firm 's plunge into the business of buying up subprime mortgages to marginal borrowers and then repackaging them into securities , overseeing the firm 's huge positions in what became a fraud - infested market .Goldman also racked up billions of dollars in profits by secretly betting on a downturn in home mortgage securities .Paulson \" knew that if he acted the way he should , that would have burst the bubble .Then Goldman Sachs would have been left with a very substantial loss , and that would have been the end of bonuses at Goldman Sachs . \" Black has emerged as a leading expert on the subprime meltdown and has testified multiple times to congressional committees and to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission , the congressionally appointed panel that 's investigating the causes of the disaster .A second Paulson critic , retired senior thrift examiner Richard Newsom , wrote to Congress about the regulatory lapses that he said contributed to the crisis .In a phone interview , he said that it was \" simply implausible that Paulson could n't see the relation between delaying strong action by Treasury and the benefit to letting places like Goldman \" reduce their risks .Newsom gained a reputation as a super - sleuth while working with Black to investigate Charles Keating 's California - based Lincoln Savings and Loan , which imploded and cost taxpayers $ 2 billion in the 1980s to pay off the thrift 's losses .In July , Goldman paid $ 550 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission civil fraud suit over its 2007 sale of one offshore bundle of risky mortgage securities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.33013"}

{"text": "He is pushing a kind of gut - level hatred and paranoia , Neiwert argues , not because of his own belief system , but because it 's a way to win votes .I would extend this line of thought further , drawing particularly on Roger Griffin 's analysis of fascism .Point One : it 's true that Trump 's candidacy , like fascism , emphasizes a kind of populism , in that Trump has presented himself as an advocate of the common people against corrupt or sinister elites .But as Griffin argues , fascism is n't populist only in a rhetorical sense .Rather , both as a movement and a regime , fascism seeks to actively and permanently mobilize large masses of people through a network of top - down organizations , constant propaganda , and elaborate public rituals such as the Nazi Party 's Nuremberg rallies .I see no indication that Trump has attempted anything like this .His campaign rallies are a short - term means to the end of winning the presidency - not the germ of any sort of lasting mass organization .Point Two : again following Griffin , fascism is n't just an \" extreme \" form of right - wing politics - it 's a revolutionary form of right - wing politics , in that it aims to create a radically new type of society , state , culture , and human being .In the fascist \" new order , \" all individual and private interests would be subordinated to those of the nation - as dictated by the fascist leadership .Yes , both Italian Fascism and German Nazism came to power through the parliamentary process and both of them , especially Italian Fascism , made huge compromises with the old order .They left major institutions such as the military , the church , and ( in Italy ) the monarchy more or less intact .But even in Italy , fascism radically transformed the country 's cultural , educational , and political landscape to conform to Mussolini 's explicitly totalitarian vision , and this transformation got stronger , not weaker , as time went on .In Germany , the fascist revolution went much further , forcibly imposing a program of \" racial purity \" through sterilization and mass killing , and reshaping the class structure through the mass enslavement and importation of non - Aryan workers .Again , Trump is good at pandering to popular fears and hatreds and feeding his own ego , but that 's a far cry from promoting an actual vision of cultural or social change .Although people often use the term fascism interchangeably with dictatorship , most dictatorships are n't fascist , because they 're all about preserving the old order rather than creating a new one , and they generally do n't involve any real populist mobilization .So even if we assume that Trump wants to outlaw elections , shred the Bill of Rights , and make himself president for life , that does n't make him a fascist .There are different ways to be dangerous , and the differences matter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.594315"}

{"text": "Trump campaign and fascism : distinct but interconnected One of the few Trump - related articles I 've seen that offers this kind of nuanced analysis is David Neiwert 's \" Donald Trump May Not Be a Fascist , But He is Leading Us Merrily Down That Path .\" There are points in Neiwert 's article that I disagree with - he counterposes fascism to democracy , for instance - but I think his basic approach here is sound .Rather than treat fascism as something radically separate and in a class by itself , Neiwert emphasizes that there 's a dynamic interrelationship between fascism and other forms of right - wing populism .And while \" merrily \" might be a bad choice of words , Neiwert is n't making light of the danger at all .Acknowledging that there 's no agreed - upon definition of fascism , Neiwert offers a composite sketch from definitions by several leading fascism scholars , including Stanley Payne , Robert O. Paxton , and Roger Griffin , and uses this to summarize Trump 's fascistic and non - fascistic aspects .On the other hand , Neiwert notes two key points that set Trump 's candidacy apart from fascism .First , although Trump has encouraged spontaneous violence against his critics and targets of his rhetoric , he 's made no moves to develop or ally with a political paramilitary force along the lines of the Italian Blackshirts or the Nazi Stormtroopers .Second , and more importantly , Trump \" lacks any kind of coherent , or even semi - coherent , ideology .\" While fascists are absolutists who demand ideological purity , \" Trump 's only real ideology is the Worship of the Donald . \"He is pushing a kind of gut - level hatred and paranoia , Neiwert argues , not because of his own belief system , but because it 's a way to win votes .I would extend this line of thought further , drawing particularly on Roger Griffin 's analysis of fascism .Point One : it 's true that Trump 's candidacy , like fascism , emphasizes a kind of populism , in that Trump has presented himself as an advocate of the common people against corrupt or sinister elites .But as Griffin argues , fascism is n't populist only in a rhetorical sense .Rather , both as a movement and a regime , fascism seeks to actively and permanently mobilize large masses of people through a network of top - down organizations , constant propaganda , and elaborate public rituals such as the Nazi Party 's Nuremberg rallies .I see no indication that Trump has attempted anything like this .His campaign rallies are a short - term means to the end of winning the presidency - not the germ of any sort of lasting mass organization .Point Two : again following Griffin , fascism is n't just an \" extreme \" form of right - wing politics - it 's a revolutionary form of right - wing politics , in that it aims to create a radically new type of society , state , culture , and human being .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.83142"}

{"text": "Liberalism became almost exactly the configuration of interests that the original populists had attacked .The second movement that drew successfully upon the populist legacy was modern conservatism .Originally a movement of anti - New Deal Republicans and hysterical anti - Communists , it achieved its first major political success when it opposed the civil rights and other new left movements of the 1960s .Through George Wallace , Ronald Reagan and other conservatives , it positioned itself as the defender of middle class \" producers \" against state bureaucrats and their welfare clients and of the middle class family against the threat of women 's and gay liberation .The conservative conception of the people was exclusive , if rarely articulated : it consisted , in Nancy Reagan 's memorable phrase , of \" nice white people . \"Conservative populism thrived off the decline of progressivism and liberalism .Even today it remains a viable politics in America -- witness Ross Perot 's continuing popularity .But Republican conservatism was set back by the onset of the recent recession and , more broadly , by the failure of Republican policies to deliver on their populist promises .The Republican failure opened the way for Clinton to attempt to revive Roosevelt 's progressive populism .Clinton himself emphatically comes out of the progressive tradition of American politics .He wants to reform American capitalism to make it more efficient and equitable .In establishing national health insurance , for instance , he does n't want to eliminate , but to regulate , the role of large insurance companies .Clinton is also rooted in the social liberal politics of the 1960s .Having gotten his start in the McGovern campaign , Clinton is committed to the goals of the civil rights and women 's movements .But in preparing to run for president , Clinton recognized that the last three Democratic candidates , running as social liberals , had been defeated in landslides by conservative populist campaigns .Clinton understood that the Democrats could not win the presidency without recapturing the middle class , and that the way to do that was to reclaim the populist legacy that the party had ceded to the Republicans beginning in 1968 .Clinton 's principal tactic was to repeat his commitment to the middle class ( that is , \" the people \" ) at every campaign stop .He bemoaned their plight ( \" the middle class is collapsing , literally reducing in numbers , while more people work harder for lower wages \" ) and promised them a tax cut if he were elected .At the same time , Clinton distanced himself from some of the Democrats ' social liberalism .He rejected a plan by Jesse Jackson and Felix Rohatyn for pouring billions into American cities and also denounced Jackson for coddling pro - riot rap singer Sister Souljah .But he stopped well short of blaming blacks or the poor for economic ills .In progressive populist fashion , Clinton attributed the plight of the middle class to special favors that the Bush and Reagan administration had bestowed upon the undeserving rich .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.00936"}

{"text": "What about the argument that while Trump may not be a fully fledged fascist yet , he 's heading in that direction ?Alexander Reid Ross argues this .In an earlier Facebook discussion , I cautioned Reid Ross that we should n't use a teleological approach to fascism .What I meant was , we should n't treat certain political initiatives as having an inherent tendency to move toward fascism , as Reid Ross appears to be arguing above .Reid Ross conceded the point but thought I meant that we should n't treat the fascist creep process as inevitable , which is not the same thing .Serves me right for using a pretentious word like teleological .I agree with Reid Ross that politics is n't static - that movements , systems , and people can change - but they can change in lots of different ways , and we should be wary of interpreting these changes in terms of inherent tendencies .Depending on the circumstances and balance of political forces , non - fascists may be pulled toward fascism , but the opposite is also true .Both Mussolini 's and Hitler 's original governments included non - fascists , who were co - opted and eventually absorbed into fascist \" projects \" ( while those who refused to be absorbed were destroyed ) .But during the same era , as Griffin has argued , fascists were co - opted into supporting conservative authoritarian regimes in several other countries , including Antonescu 's Romania , Vichy France , and Franco 's Spain .Bringing all this back to Trump , there are at least two different ways to read the friendly reception his campaign has gotten from many white nationalist far rightists .One is that these fascists represent the logical endpoint of Trumpism in development , and while he draws the crowds they provide the ideas .This is at least consistent with Alexander Reid Ross 's position quoted above .Another interpretation , however , is that Trump 's campaign is co - opting far rightists into , if not renewed loyalty , at least suspending their disloyalty to the existing political order .JM Wong has argued on Facebook that Trump 's anti - Muslim rhetoric comes at a time when \" the legitimacy of the state is increasingly challenged for white people \" as \" the wages of whiteness are dwindling . \"To the extent that far rightists support this call , they are buying into the system they claim to oppose .Conversely , the defeat of Trump 's candidacy could further intensify the white nationalist far right as an oppositional force .Neglected factors : capitalists and theocrats One issue that 's gotten very little attention in most of these discussions is fascism 's class politics .\" In both Italy and Germany , capitalists helped fascists gain power , trading control over state policy for a crackdown against the working class .In the U.S. as it exists today , any drive to impose fascism would need support from at least a major faction of capital .The white nationalist far right currently enjoys little if any such support .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.61046"}

{"text": "Yes , both Italian Fascism and German Nazism came to power through the parliamentary process and both of them , especially Italian Fascism , made huge compromises with the old order .They left major institutions such as the military , the church , and ( in Italy ) the monarchy more or less intact .But even in Italy , fascism radically transformed the country 's cultural , educational , and political landscape to conform to Mussolini 's explicitly totalitarian vision , and this transformation got stronger , not weaker , as time went on .In Germany , the fascist revolution went much further , forcibly imposing a program of \" racial purity \" through sterilization and mass killing , and reshaping the class structure through the mass enslavement and importation of non - Aryan workers .Again , Trump is good at pandering to popular fears and hatreds and feeding his own ego , but that 's a far cry from promoting an actual vision of cultural or social change .Although people often use the term fascism interchangeably with dictatorship , most dictatorships are n't fascist , because they 're all about preserving the old order rather than creating a new one , and they generally do n't involve any real populist mobilization .So even if we assume that Trump wants to outlaw elections , shred the Bill of Rights , and make himself president for life , that does n't make him a fascist .There are different ways to be dangerous , and the differences matter .A \" powerful trend \" toward fascism ?What about the argument that while Trump may not be a fully fledged fascist yet , he 's heading in that direction ?Alexander Reid Ross argues this .In an earlier Facebook discussion , I cautioned Reid Ross that we should n't use a teleological approach to fascism .What I meant was , we should n't treat certain political initiatives as having an inherent tendency to move toward fascism , as Reid Ross appears to be arguing above .Reid Ross conceded the point but thought I meant that we should n't treat the fascist creep process as inevitable , which is not the same thing .Serves me right for using a pretentious word like teleological .I agree with Reid Ross that politics is n't static - that movements , systems , and people can change - but they can change in lots of different ways , and we should be wary of interpreting these changes in terms of inherent tendencies .Depending on the circumstances and balance of political forces , non - fascists may be pulled toward fascism , but the opposite is also true .Both Mussolini 's and Hitler 's original governments included non - fascists , who were co - opted and eventually absorbed into fascist \" projects \" ( while those who refused to be absorbed were destroyed ) .But during the same era , as Griffin has argued , fascists were co - opted into supporting conservative authoritarian regimes in several other countries , including Antonescu 's Romania , Vichy France , and Franco 's Spain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "136.06104"}
