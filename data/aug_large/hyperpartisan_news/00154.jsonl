{"text": "Cyberbullying is becoming more and more prevalent .Children , celebrities and campaigners are among those who have experienced abuse , whilst evidence suggests that it is also becoming a problem in workplaces .In the past decade communication technologies have increasingly infiltrated the workplace .For instance , UK office workers send and receive 10,000 emails per year according to researchers at Warwick Business School .Many of these will be generic work requests , a few might be impolite and some could be downright abusive .There are reasons to believe that cyberbullying behaviours perpetrated in the organisational context are more subtle than those observed among children and adolescents .This is because employees are bound by regulations that prohibit explicit abuse aimed at co - workers and adults may have developed the capacity to disguise bullying behaviours .Despite this , workplace cyberbullying can still cause harm as researchers have linked it to low job satisfaction , mental strain and intention to quit the organisation .Examples of workplace cyberbullying can include online threats , overly critical emails and the distribution of embarrassing pictures and personal information .Aspects of computer mediated communication mean that workplace cyberbullying differs from offline workplace bullying in several key ways .For instance , it is possible for perpetrators to remain anonymous , the perpetrator and victim are often in different locations when messages are distributed and cyber acts can be seen by a much larger audience .Furthermore , certain acts of cyberbullying are more permanent than the transience of offline bullying acts and they can be experience by employees outside of the work environment .Before in - depth research can address workplace cyberbullying it is critical to develop valid and reliable tools to measure it .This is the focus of a study being run by researchers at the University of Sheffield .If you are employed and would like to take part in the study please click on the link below .Researchers from the University of Sheffield are working with the support of No Bullying to identify how negative behaviours conducted through technology can impact employee health , job satisfaction and working relationships .People are increasingly using technology to communicate with their colleagues .It is therefore important to investigate how negative technology - mediated behaviours affect employees .If you are employed and would like to contribute to knowledge on cyberbullying within the context of work , we would like to invite you to take a short survey on negative technological experiences , job satisfaction , health and work engagement .To obtain data that will give a casual indication of how negative technological behaviours affect people , we need to collect data now and again in six months ' time .Therefore we would like to invite you to complete this survey now as well as a second survey that will be distributed in six months .This study has been ethically approved by the Sheffield University Management School .All responses are anonymous and strictly confidential .You are also free to withdraw from the study at any time by closing the web page .To participate in the study click on this link .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.07877"}

{"text": "Unfortunately , some individuals with AS are not even aware when that they are being bullied because of their social naivety and impaired social cognition .As a result , adults must be exceptionally vigilant in their observations and be willing to do additional detective work when problems occur involving the social arena .It has been my experience that sometimes well - meaning adults are often too quick to point out a social error the child with AS has made when such issues occur .This may contribute to further victimization because individuals with AS are very likely to make social blunders or errors because of the innate characteristics of their disability .Since many people who experience chronic , frequent bullying carry a lot of self - blame and shame , we must be careful not to add on any further blame and shame .We can not expect the most vulnerable , least empowered individual , the child with AS who is being bullied , to fix the problem .Another critical aspect of our adult role in bullying prevention is to address low - level bullying when it occurs in our presence or is reported to us .When low - level bullying is ignored or even encouraged , it implies acceptance and further victimizes the targeted child .It also creates a heightened sense of hopelessness and feeds the tendency of children not to go to adults for help .A few examples of low - level bullying are name - calling , other types of put - downs , nonverbal gestures and \" dirty \" looks , and intentionally leaving someone out of a group activity .These are common occurrences in the school environment and only a sampling of the types of bullying children experience .Unfortunately , research indicates that adults almost always underestimate the extent and impact of bullying compared to what students report they are experiencing .Research also indicates a \" culture of silence \" where children do not report bullying and hold low expectations for the amount of support and help adults will give them .Obviously , we need to be more diligent in our awareness of bullying and our responses when it occurs or is reported to us .An equally important adult responsibility is to make sure that we model the behaviors we require from our students or our own children .Efforts to impact the behavior and attitudes of our children will fail miserably if we as adults do not hold ourselves to the same or higher levels of respect and accountability .The use of sarcasm is a common type of adult bullying and though it may be useful in the short term at controlling behavior , it comes at the expense of humiliating and angering our youth .For children with AS who may already be experiencing bullying by their peers and have less social support , this can create even more vulnerability and may contribute to them becoming a scapegoat for an entire class or school community .Adult acceptance , support , and protection are extremely critical for any child in this situation .Having an adult take action , take a stand , or even take an interest in this child can make all the difference .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.85147"}
