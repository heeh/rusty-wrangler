Smith ( 1990 ) .The state of Oregon denied their application for unemployment benefits because they had been fired for work - related misconduct .Smith and Black took their case to the courts , where they argued they should not be denied government benefits because the cause of their dismissal - the use of peyote for religious purposes - was protected by the Free Exercise Clause .In an opinion that stunned many in the legal world , the court , by a vote of 6 - 3 , rejected the Native Americans ' claim .Justice Antonin Scalia 's opinion , joined by four other justices , concluded that in most circumstances , generally applicable laws that impose a burden on religious practice - such as Oregon 's criminal prohibition on the use of peyote - are not subject to the compelling interest test .Scalia 's opinion explicitly hearkened back to the reasoning in Reynolds , the first polygamy case .The Free Exercise Clause protects religious beliefs , he wrote , but it does not insulate religiously motivated actions from laws , unless the laws single out religion for disfavored treatment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "37.98726"}

Ferguson .It is not in the Constitution 's text .It is a metaphor to help capture the meaning , or at least one asserted meaning , of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .Constitutional cases commonly discuss important rules that determine who may bring a case in federal court , and whether the courts have the power to hear particular claims .We ask whether a plaintiff has \" standing \" to sue , and whether a case is \" ripe \" for adjudication and not \" moot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.54486"}

{"text": "The First Amendment guarantees the freedoms of religion , speech , press , assembly , and petition .Religion .The religion aspect of the First Amendment is split into the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause .The Establishment Clause has been interpreted to prevent the federal government from establishing a national religion or preferring one religion over another .The Free Exercise Clause has been interpreted to allow all people to freely practice the religion of their choosing .Each of these clauses has been incorporated and applied to the states , and there have been several cases regarding each that have molded and shaped the freedom of religion in the United States .In the 1962 case Engel v. Vitale , the Supreme Court ruled that official prayer in public schools violates the Establishment Clause , indicating that students may not be forced to pray in school .In the 1971 case Lemon v. Kurtzman , the Supreme Court ruled that direct government assistance to religious schools is unconstitutional .It also set up guidelines for government involvement with religion called the Lemon Test , which stated three clauses that must be met in order to avoid violating the Establishment Clause .These are ; ( 1 )The government action must have a secular legislative purpose ( 2 )The government can not primarily enforce religion ( 3 )The government can not \" excessively entangle \" with religion ( Oyez 1 ) .In the 1990 case Westside Community Schools v. Mergens , the Supreme Court ruled that schools can use public funds to support clubs that are religious or political in nature .Free Exercise Clause Cases : .In the 1878 case Reynolds v. United States , the Supreme Court ruled that a religious duty is not a viable defense to a criminal indictment .This established that illegal actions such as bigamy ( the issue debated in the case ) can not be committed , even for religious purposes .In the 1990 case Employment Division of Oregon v. Smith , the Supreme Court ruled that states have the right to deny unemployment benefits to someone fired for using prohibited drugs for religious purposes while working .Speech .The speech aspect of the First Amendment has also been broken up and defined more specifically as time has gone on .Several Supreme Court cases have been decided that have defined certain types of speech and enunciated what is allowed to be regulated by the government .In the 1919 case Schenck v. United States , the Supreme Court ruled to allow Congress to restrict speech that creates a clear and present danger .This means that , although Americans are free to speak as they please , they may not do so in a manner than endangers others , for example , shouting \" fire \" in a crowded movie theater .In the 1925 case Gitlow v. New York , the Supreme Court ruled that state governments are not completely free to limit forms of political expression .Symbolic Speech .In the 1969 case Tinker v.

{"text": "As written , the First Amendment applied only to Congress and the federal government .In the wake of the Civil War , however , the 14th Amendment was adopted .From that point on , all government action , whether at the federal , state , or local level , must abide by the restrictions of the establishment clause .Some , including Chief Justice William Rehnquist , argue that the term was intended to prohibit only the establishment of a single national church or the preference of one religious sect over another .Others , including a majority of the justices of the current Supreme Court , believe the term prohibits the government from promoting religion in general as well as the preference of one religion over another .In the words of the Court in Everson : .Neither can pass laws that aid one religion , aid all religions , or prefer one religion over another .Neither can force a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion ... .Neither a state or the federal government may , openly or secretly , participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice versa .In the words of Jefferson , the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect ' a wall of separation between church and state . 'To help interpret the establishment clause , the Court uses several tests , including the Lemon , coercion , endorsement and neutrality tests .Lemon test .The first of these tests is a three - part assessment sometimes referred to as the Lemon test .The test derives its name from the 1971 decision Lemon v. Kurtzman , in which the Court struck down a state program providing aid to religious elementary and secondary schools .Using the Lemon test , a court must first determine whether the law or government action in question has a bona fide secular purpose .This prong is based on the idea that government should only concern itself in civil matters , leaving religion to the conscience of the individual .Second , a court would ask whether the state action has the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion .Finally , the court would consider whether the action excessively entangles religion and government .While religion and government must interact at some points while co - existing in society , the concern here is that they do not so overlap and intertwine that people have difficulty differentiating between the two .Although the test has come under fire from several Supreme Court justices , courts continue to use this test in most establishment - clause cases .Lemon test redux .In its 1997 decision Agostini v. Felton , the Supreme Court modified the Lemon test .The Court in Agostini identified three primary criteria for determining whether a government action has a primary effect of advancing religion : 1 ) government indoctrination , 2 ) defining the recipients of government benefits based on religion , and 3 ) excessive entanglement between government and religion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "42.48841"}

Illinois ( 1959 ) , Justice Frankfurter summarized the case against incorporating the \" due process \" clause : .We have held from the beginning and uniformly that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to the States any of the provisions of the first eight amendments as such .The relevant historical materials have been canvassed by this Court and by legal scholars .These materials demonstrate conclusively that Congress and the members of the legislatures of the ratifying States did not contemplate that the Fourteenth Amendment was a short - hand incorporation of the first eight amendments making them applicable as explicit restrictions upon the States .In Adamson v. California , decided just a few months after the Bartkus case , Justice Frankfurter described the negative consequences of the incorporation doctrine : .It would assume that no other abuses would reveal themselves in the course of time than those which had become manifest in 1791 .Such a view not only disregards the historic meaning of \" due process .\" It leads inevitably to a warped construction of specific provisions of the Bill of Rights to bring within their scope conduct clearly condemned by due process but not easily fitting into the pigeon - holes of the specific provisions .He also gave the Court a history lesson : .Between the incorporation of the Fourteenth Amendment into the Constitution and the beginning of the present membership of the Court - a period of 70 years - the scope of that Amendment was passed upon by 43 judges .But they were also judges mindful of the relation of our federal system to a progressively democratic society and therefore duly regardful of the scope of authority that was left to the States even after the Civil War . . . . .Justice Frankfurter concluded : .This has been confirmed numerous times by the Supreme Court .The meaning of \" due process \" in its historical context was discussed in Davidson v.

City of Hialeah .There , the Court closely analyzed a facially neutral and generally applicable law and determined that it was neither neutral nor generally applicable .Since the law burdened a religious practice ( here the animal sacrifice ritual of the Santeria religion ) , the government would have to demonstrate that it had a compelling interest in passing the law .In Hialeah , the government could not meet this burden and the law was stuck down .

U.S. ( 1878 ) , in which the Court upheld a federal law banning polygamy over objections by Mormons who claimed that the practice was their religious duty .As that standard was easy for the government to satisfy , for almost a century the courts generally rejected religious - freedom claims against generally applicable laws .In effect , the Supreme Court did not have opportunity to review this issue until the mid-20th century , when various free - exercise clause cases made their way through the state courts to the Supreme Court .In its 1963 decision Sherbert v. Verner , the Supreme Court found that the Constitution afforded at least some degree of government accommodation of religious practices .When she could not find other employment that would not require her to work on Saturday , she filed a claim for unemployment benefits .South Carolina law provided that a person was ineligible for benefits if he or she failed , without good cause , to accept available suitable employment when offered .The state denied Sherbert benefits , saying she had not accepted suitable employment when offered , even though she was required to work on her Sabbath .The decision was upheld by the South Carolina Supreme Court .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "44.76838"}

{"text": "Religious Liberty .A Policy Statement Adopted by the House of Delegates , North Carolina Council of Churches , October 28 , 1998 .Religious liberty is sometimes called the \" first freedom .\" While this is not the place to debate the relative worth of our many freedoms , the simple fact is that , when you begin to read our Bill of Rights , what you read first are the religious liberty clauses of the First Amendment .Many of us in the religious community feel that religious freedom is a hallmark of American liberty and that it has made possible a vibrancy and diversity in religious life unlike that in most other countries , without the religious turmoil found in many parts of the world .What we call religious liberty ( or the \" separation of church and state , \" using language of Thomas Jefferson , not language of the First Amendment ) is actually two separate rights .The Free Exercise Clause prohibits government from interfering in the practice of religion .Decisions by the United States Supreme Court earlier in this decade have left the Free Exercise Clause greatly weakened , a shadow of its former self , no more than a \" puff of smoke , \" in the words of a state court in Ohio .Prior to the 1960 's , there were very few court cases to flesh out what the Free Exercise Clause really meant .A case from the 1870 's had upheld a federal law banning polygamy , even when practiced by Mormons for whom it was based on religious belief .The Court in effect said that the First Amendment could not prohibit Mormons from believing that polygamy was acceptable .But , when they began to put belief into practice , government could restrict that practice because of the overwhelming importance of traditional family structures .In 1963 , the Court heard a case involving a Jehovah 's Witness who had been fired for refusing to work on Saturday .The Court came down on the side of the Jehovah 's Witness and set up a legal standard which governed Free Exercise law for the next 30 years .It said that government could not interfere in the practice of genuinely - held religious beliefs unless there were a \" compelling state interest \" in doing so .In later cases , a refinement was added to the \" compelling state interest \" test : Even if there were such an interest that justified the state infringing on someone 's religious beliefs , that infringement must be in the \" least restrictive \" way possible .This standard for free exercise cases seemed reasonable and workable .It protected practices of small and/or unpopular religious groups .( Free exercise claims rarely arise if you have the political clout to prevent the enactment of laws which could interfere with the practice of your religion . )But it also provided a way to prevent the First Amendment from being used as a justification for violating laws which were truly critical to the functioning of society .( For example , an Amish employer who had refused to pay Social Security and unemployment taxes lost in a 1982 case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.783165"}
{"text": "It ought not to require argument to reject the notion that due process of law meant one thing in the Fifth Amendment and another in the Fourteenth .But , it is sometimes argued , the \" due process \" clause incorporates the Bill of Rights ; it is merely a shorthand expression for the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights .Therefore , there is no way that the \" due process \" clause in the Fourteenth Amendment could be said to incorporate the Bill of Rights and apply those amendments to the states .Writing the opinion for the Court in the case of Bartkus v. Illinois ( 1959 ) , Justice Frankfurter summarized the case against incorporating the \" due process \" clause : .We have held from the beginning and uniformly that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to the States any of the provisions of the first eight amendments as such .The relevant historical materials have been canvassed by this Court and by legal scholars .These materials demonstrate conclusively that Congress and the members of the legislatures of the ratifying States did not contemplate that the Fourteenth Amendment was a short - hand incorporation of the first eight amendments making them applicable as explicit restrictions upon the States .In Adamson v. California , decided just a few months after the Bartkus case , Justice Frankfurter described the negative consequences of the incorporation doctrine : .It would assume that no other abuses would reveal themselves in the course of time than those which had become manifest in 1791 .Such a view not only disregards the historic meaning of \" due process .\" It leads inevitably to a warped construction of specific provisions of the Bill of Rights to bring within their scope conduct clearly condemned by due process but not easily fitting into the pigeon - holes of the specific provisions .He also gave the Court a history lesson : .Between the incorporation of the Fourteenth Amendment into the Constitution and the beginning of the present membership of the Court - a period of 70 years - the scope of that Amendment was passed upon by 43 judges .But they were also judges mindful of the relation of our federal system to a progressively democratic society and therefore duly regardful of the scope of authority that was left to the States even after the Civil War . . . . .Justice Frankfurter concluded : .This has been confirmed numerous times by the Supreme Court .The meaning of \" due process \" in its historical context was discussed in Davidson v. City of New Orleans ( 1877 ) by Justice Miller : .The prohibition against depriving the citizen or subject of his life , liberty , or property without due process of law , is not new in the constitutional history of the English race .It is not new in the constitutional history of this country , and it was not new in the Constitution of the United States when it became a part of the fourteenth amendment , in the year 1866 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.877686"}

' ' Contrary to that principle , current litigation rules are hostile to religion because they allow some groups to coerce States and localities into removing any reference to religion in public places .Consequently , local governments are being forced to accede to the demands of those seeking to remove religious words or tear down symbols , and ban religious people from using the public square , even when allowing those uses might , in fact , be constitutional .H.R. 2679 amends 42 U.S.C. so that attorneys ' fees could not be awarded to prevailing parties in Establishment Clause cases .It amends 42 U.S.C. to make clear that while Establishment Clause cases can continue to be brought against State and local governments , they can be brought only for injunctive or declaratory relief .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.445126"}

{"text": "In Engel v.

{"text": "Congress targeted these two types of regulations after conducting hearings and determining that these were the two areas in which state and local governments are most likely to disfavor or ignore religious interests .For religious land use , RLUIPA offers additional protection beyond the compelling interest test .Whereas the institutionalized persons provision applies the compelling interest test to regulations that substantially burden the religious exercise of institutionalized people , the land use provision goes further .It not only applies the compelling interest standard to land use regulation but also prohibits land use regulation that discriminates on the basis of religion .This nondiscrimination provision requires the government to regulate religious and secular land use equally .How have religious groups fared in claiming that particular land use regulations violate RLUIPA ?Religious groups have been more successful under the nondiscrimination provision than under the compelling interest standard .Many lawsuits brought under the nondiscrimination provision have challenged laws that exclude churches but not secular nonprofits from an area .In these cases , courts have held that the government must provide a good reason for excluding the church and not other groups .When the government has not been able to provide such a reason , which is often the case , the religious group has prevailed .Religious groups have not fared as well , however , under the compelling interest test .This is because many courts have imposed strict limitations on what counts as a substantial burden .Since land use regulations rarely impose such burdens , courts have rejected many of these challenges before ever having to determine whether the government had a compelling interest .In the few situations in which religious groups have demonstrated substantial burdens , the groups have generally prevailed because courts have generally held that the government 's particular reason for enforcing a land use regulation falls short of the required compelling interest .In a number of these cases , land use authorities have denied congregations the right to locate or expand churches because neighbors have opposed the traffic that the proposed change would have created .Although traffic control is important , courts have not treated it as a compelling public interest .How does RLUIPA apply to the Third Church of Christ , Scientist , which sued the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board for designating its church building a historic landmark ?This is an unusual RLUIPA case because most such disputes involve the government excluding a church from a particular area .This case is about the government 's effort to preserve a church building .Another interesting dimension of the case is the church building itself .The building was designed by a well - known architect named Araldo Cossutta and was built in what is called a Brutalist style .As part of the modernist architectural movement , Brutalism flourished from the 1950s to the 1970s .As its name suggests , Brutalism uses raw concrete and stark geometric designs to create an imposing space .Finding the building unattractive and expensive to heat and cool , the members of the church want to demolish it and build a new one in its place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.17118"}

{"text": "I do argue that in this , as in many other areas of the law , we recognize that the structural politics today are different from what they were fifty years ago .On the other hand , the right of assembly will not always trump competing interests .Courts will have to draw lines and balance interests , just as they do with the freedom of speech .The right of assembly is a presumptive right of individuals to form and participate in peaceable , noncommercial groups .This right is rebuttable when there is a compelling reason for thinking that the justifications for protecting assembly do not apply ( as when the group prospers under monopolistic or near - monopolistic conditions ) .This proposal differs from two competing alternatives .The first is the neolibertarian proposal .I reject this approach because it fails to account for the way in which the dynamics of power operate in some noncommercial groups .The second is what Koppelman calls the message - based approach , the Court 's current framework for analyzing claims of the right of association .I critique the theory , doctrine , and history of the message - based approach throughout this book , but in Chapter 5 , I pay particular attention to Koppelman 's arguments .Koppelman believes that a requirement that a group self - identify as \" stridently prejudiced \" is \" desirable , \" because \" discrimination is not so cheap as it was before , and a group will have to decide whether discrimination is worth the added cost .\" I explain why this approach is misguided as a matter of First Amendment doctrine , workability , and efficiency .In my view , we are better off with a contextual analysis that allows courts to examine how power operates on the ground .This approach would ask courts to evaluate challenges to the exercise of the right of assembly in the specific contexts in which those assemblies exist .Sometimes - albeit rarely - the power exerted by peaceable , noncommercial assemblies will overreach to such an extent that the right will give way to the interests of the state .Let me offer a few other examples of the kind of contextual analysis that I have in mind .In the 1950s , African American voters in Fort Bend County , Texas , challenged their exclusion from the Jaybird Democratic Association - a private group not governed by state election laws .The Jaybird Association held an election among its members every year prior to the Democratic primary .For more than sixty years , the candidate selected by the Jaybirds went on to win the Democratic primary and the general election .Most people would recognize that the Jaybirds would qualify under my definition as a peaceable , noncommercial assembly .Most people would also recognize that the Jaybirds had so skewed the balance of power in Fort Bend County that they deserved to be denied the protections of assembly .Or take a more contemporary example .Suppose that membership in the Christian Legal Society at Hastings College of the Law was a prerequisite to the most desirable legal jobs - a feather in the cap surpassing even membership on the Hastings Law Journal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.38794"}

The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore ( 1833 ) should be followed here .In writing about the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the states , Marshall clearly explains why such was not the case : .Had the framers of these amendments intended them to be limitations on the powers of the state governments , they would have imitated the framers of the original constitution , and have expressed that intention .It is inconceivable that if such a thing took place that such a significant doctrine as incorporation would be so veiled that it would take years before some Supreme Court judge discovered that there was such a thing .The Blaine Amendment .We know from the opening line of the First Amendment ( \" Congress shall make no law \" ) that the Amendment applied only to the federal government .It is a fact of history that James Madison 's proposal in 1789 to extend to the states the freedom of speech and of the press was rejected by the Congress that gave us the Bill of Rights .When the Constitution refers to the states it clearly says so .For example , it says in Article I , sec .9 of the Constitution that \" no Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed .\" That this only applies to the federal government is evident because in the next section it prohibits states from passing \" any Bill of Attainder \" or \" ex post facto law .\" This view of the Constitution prevailed even after the addition of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution .In 1875 , which was several years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , an amendment to the Constitution was proposed in the House of Representatives by James G. Blaine ( 1830 - 1893 ) , the speaker of the House from 1869 to 1875 .Known as the Blaine Amendment , it reads : .The Blaine Amendment passed in the House but not in the Senate so it was never sent to the states for ratification .The purpose of the amendment - to keep Catholic schools from receiving state funds - is irrelevant .What is relevant is the opening phrase , which should be compared with the opening phrase of the First Amendment : .No state shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; .Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; .The wording of Blaine Amendment shows that the Congress at the time did not consider the First Amendment to be incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.018692"}

{"text": "The plaintiffs ' lawyers reiterated that the prayer offended the sensibilities of their clients and represented to them an establishment of religion .Therefore , it was a violation of their clients ' right ( according to their understanding of the First Amendment ) to be federally protected from establishments of religion .That argument ignored the palpable fact that the purpose of the Establishment Clause , as the House and Senate revised it and three - fourths of the states ratified it , was to forbid the federal government from regulating religious practices in the states .Nevertheless , the Supreme Court embraced the plaintiffs ' reasoning and ruled that approval by a state of a brief , voluntarily recited , nondenominational prayer constituted an establishment of religion - and moreover , that the establishment of religion by any level of government in the United States was unconstitutional .Now , nearly fifty years on from Engel , the logic of this decision has become second nature for many Americans .Certainly , our history textbooks celebrate it as an achievement in the march of American liberty .But what did the decision really mean ?In fact , the Supreme Court was canceling the free - exercise rights of those parents in the state of New York who wanted their children to recite the prayer the state 's Board of Education had approved .The Court justified depriving them of their free - exercise right under the First Amendment by trumping that right with the Establishment Clause , thus using one provision of the Constitution to cancel another provision .In effect , the Court regarded the Free - Exercise Clause as if it did not exist ; or at least , the Court regarded it as radically subordinate to the apparent - but unhistorical - value of secularity which was deduced from the Establishment Clause .Moreover , the Court ignored the fact that recitation of the prayer in question neither conferred any governmental benefit on a particular religious denomination nor showed an exclusive preference for one religion over other religions - both of those results being inherent purposes of religious establishments .What about the famous \" wall of separation between Church & State \" that Thomas Jefferson referred to in his letter of January 1 , 1802 , to the Baptists of Danbury , Connecticut ?The major political issue lying behind this letter was President Jefferson 's refusal to declare a day of thanksgiving ( to God ) for a peace treaty just reached between France and Britain .The Anglo - French conflict had threatened to draw the young American nation into war , and on a rather less momentous occasion in 1796 , President Washington had himself declared a day of national thanksgiving .Jefferson 's stance would seem to indicate a settled conviction against any even symbolic connection between religion and government generally .But here it must also be observed that Jefferson , as governor of Virginia in 1779 , had proclaimed a day of fasting and prayer in that state when requested to do so .Based on this historical record , a natural inference is that Jefferson did not think that he had , as president of the United States , the constitutional power to authorize a national religious exercise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.47027"}

{"text": "What connection is there between the First Amendment 's Establishment Clause ( \" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion \" ) and this fact that seven of the fourteen states had establishments of religion ?Could the purpose of the Establishment Clause have been to prevent the federal government from interfering with those religious establishments ?Were the two religion clauses - establishment and free - exercise - coordinate protections of the right of the states to regulate religious matters within their borders ?And what , exactly , is \" an establishment of religion \" ?Each of these questions bears on the Supreme Court 's reversal over the past half century of the First Amendment 's prohibition against federal intrusion into religious matters .Let us first take up the question of what exactly a religious establishment is .In addressing this matter , one must understand that the Supreme Court 's ruling in 1962 in Engel v. Vitale -that a religious exercise in a public school represents an establishment of religion - redefined the meaning of a religious establishment .But it is even more important to understand that no court ruling can change the historical reality of what a religious establishment is .The Supreme Court possesses vast power , but that does not include the ability to rewrite history .The nature of religious establishments in the history of Western civilization is clear and can not be altered by any court .An establishment of religion is a declaration by a government , in a law , of a preference for one particular religion , which the law names .This declaration of a preference is substantial and not just nominal , because the establishment law grants the preferred religion some substantial benefit that government alone can confer .The establishment law confers the benefit on the identified religion only ; the churches of other religions , and persons unaffiliated with any organized religion , are excluded from receiving it .Typically , the benefit bestowed is the privilege of receiving institutional support from public revenues or the privilege to vote and hold public office - sometimes a combination of both .No establishment of religion exists when a government treats the members of every faith equally , tolerates free , public expression of any religious faith , and enacts no establishment law bestowing a substantial governmental benefit on one religion to the exclusion of all others .The churches representing the religions established through these state laws were all supported by donations of money from the public treasuries of the seven states that had privileged them as the preferred churches of their governments .Only Massachusetts and Connecticut , however , had what could be termed strong religious establishments , since the establishment laws in those states gave preference to just one church and made membership in it a qualification for voting and holding public office .Thus , it is a plain matter of historical record that since 1833 no establishment law has existed anywhere in the United States ; hence , there have been no establishments of religion since that date .Yet that was what the Supreme Court held in its 1962 judgment in Engel and in its 1985 judgment in Wallace v. Jaffree .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.344074"}

Baltimore , the First Amendment - along with the rest of the Bill of Rights - was held inapplicable to the states .This meant that for nearly a century the courts could not hear challenges under the federal constitution to restrictions of speech by the states .When courts did consider free speech claims , they almost always ruled against them .In the 1870s , a number of challenges were brought against the Comstock Act , a federal law that prohibited the mailing of obscene material .In the early 1900s , the courts took a similarly limited view of the First Amendment .In a series of confrontations known as the free speech fights , cities across the country banned labor unions from spreading their messages on sidewalks and street corners .When those laws were challenged , the courts upheld them , ruling that the preservation of order outweighed the unions ' interest in expressing their views .The Supreme Court was no exception to this trend .In 1907 , it adopted the cramped English view that freedom of speech prohibits only pre - publication censorship but places no limits on the government 's power to punish speakers after the fact .And even when the Court renounced that view in the spring of 1919 , it continued to defer to the government 's suppression of speech , upholding the convictions of Eugene Debs and other socialists who were prosecuted under the Espionage and Sedition Acts of World War I. .The turning point came later that same year when Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , who had written the opinion in Debs , had a change of heart .But that did n't happen all at once .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.842106"}

{"text": "Meanwhile , female abolitionists and suffragists in the North organized their efforts around a particular form of assembly , the convention .As Akhil Amar has observed , the nineteenth - century movements of the disenfranchised brought \" a different lived experience \" to the words of the First Amendment 's assembly clause .They were political movements , to be sure , but they embodied and symbolized even larger societal and cultural challenges .At the end of the nineteenth century , the Supreme Court misconstrued the text of the First Amendment in suggesting that the right of assembly was limited to the purposes of petitioning for a redress of grievances .But while some commentators accepted this narrow interpretation , state courts interpreting parallel state constitutional provisions of assembly articulated far broader protections .This more expansive sense of assembly was also represented in three social movements during the Progressive Era : a revitalized women 's movement , a surge in political activity among African Americans , and an increasingly agitated labor movement .The Supreme Court made the federal right of assembly applicable to the states in its 1937 opinion De Jonge v. Oregon .The newly expanded right gained traction in subsequent cases .But these advances proved evanescent , and later cases involving the rights of \" speech and assembly \" routinely resolved the latter within the framework of the former .Although the right of assembly remained important in several decisions overturning convictions of African Americans who participated in peaceful civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s , courts resolved most cases involving group autonomy without considering assembly .The Supreme Court , in fact , has not addressed an assembly claim in thirty years .Around the time that assembly began falling out of political and legal discourse , the Supreme Court shifted its constitutional focus to a new concept : association .The development of the constitutional right of association - and with it , the disappearance of assembly - in many ways depended upon surrounding contexts .I divide these contexts into two eras .The first , which I call the national security era , began in the late 1940s and lasted until the early 1960s .It formed the background for the Court 's initial recognition of the right of association in NAACP v. Alabama .The second , which I call the equality era , began in the 1960s and included an important reinterpretation of the right of association in Roberts v. United States Jaycees .Political , jurisprudential , and theoretical factors shaped the right of association in each of these eras .In the national security era , the primary political factor was the historical coincidence of the Second Red Scare and the Civil Rights Movement .From the late 1940s to the early 1960s , the government 's response to the communist threat pitted national security interests against group autonomy .Segregationists in the South capitalized on these tensions by analogizing the unrest stirred by the NAACP to the threats posed by communist organizations ; segregationists even charged that communist influences had infiltrated the NAACP .The Supreme Court responded unevenly , suppressing communist groups in the name of order and stability but extending broad protections to civil rights groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.085915"}

{"text": "Engel v. Vitale produced a torrent of Supreme Court regulation - restriction - of religious expression in the states .Prior to Engel , going back as far as the 1879 Mormon polygamy case , only eight lawsuits involving religion came before the Supreme Court ; before 1879 there were none .Since 1962 , there has been on average more than one such case each year .By means of the authority of judges - most importantly the justices on the Supreme Court - the First Amendment 's Establishment Clause has been disjoined from the Free - Exercise Clause and has in the past five decades gained an ascendancy over the Free - Exercise Clause that is now almost absolute .This has been done despite the fact that these twin clauses in the First Amendment were conceived and born together , to ensure that the federal government did not interfere with the states ' reserved rights with respect to religion .2 But how to correct this mess ?Over the past two decades , a sophisticated literature has emerged that plainly reveals the historical fallacies and tendentious theorizing that lie at the basis of the Court 's religion decisions .Yet still , decisions such as Engel have not been overturned .The Court remains adamant in its defense of the secularism of public institutions .It seems only a new constitutional amendment could return us to the religious liberty envisioned in the First Amendment .One thing is certain : to relegate freedom of religion solely to nonpublic venues is an unconstitutional suppression of belief in God , a belief that has been of central importance to Americans throughout their history .Notes .Everson v.

{"text": "Cantwell v. Connecticut .The establishment clause does more than ban the federal government from establishing religion ; it bars even laws respecting establishment .The Blunt Amendment establishes religion .The First Amendment does not say that Congress shall not establish a religion or create an establishment of religion .It says \" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion \" .Whether \" respecting \" means honoring or concerning , the clause means that Congress shall make no law on that subject .The ban is not just on establishments of religion but on laws respecting them , a fact that allows a law to fall short of creating an establishment yet still be unconstitutional .Again ... the Blunt Amendment constitutionally fails on these grounds .An overlooked aspect of the free exercise clause which is a blind spot among Republicans , and especially Rick Santorum ... the lawyer who should know better , is that it looks back to the establishment clause for its definition of \" religion .\" The establishment clause says that Congress may make no law respecting an establishment of \" religion , \" while the free exercise clause says that Congress can not prohibit the free exercise \" thereof .\"Logically , the word \" thereof \" must have the same content as the object to which it refers .Accordingly , what counts as \" religion \" for one clause must count as \" religion \" for the other .The free exercise clause makes no sense unless the word \" religion \" is read to encompass more than a church , denomination , or sect .The state abridges free exercise when it interferes with only small parts of an individual 's religious practice .The state , for example , abridges free exercise when it tells students they can not pray during school , even if it allows them complete freedom to practice all other aspects of their faith .Similarly , the state can not tell a church it must provide contraception coverage even if the church is otherwise left free to use its property as it wishes .The Obama Compromise deals with this .Private prayer and contraception are protected by the free exercise clause despite the fact that neither of these practices constitutes religions in and of themselves .If prayer and contraception count as \" religion \" for the purposes of the free exercise clause , they must also count as \" religion \" for the purposes of the establishment clause .Just as the state abridges religion when it tells a student she can not pray , so too does it establish religion when it requires prayer to be said in the schools .The state does not cross the line to establishment only when it goes to the trouble and expense of setting up a state church ; it crosses that line when it sets up any religious practice that constitutes \" religion \" for the purposes of free exercise .To the extent that Republicans want to read the \" thereof \" in the free exercise clause broadly , they must also accept a broad reading of \" religion \" in the establishment clause .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.874527"}

Kurtzman , which continually evolves into new forms as the Court 's membership changes , and which conservative justices attempt to overrule at every opportunity .Under Lemon , government acts are illegal if they lack a predominantly - secular purpose , advance or inhibit religion , or excessively entangle government with religion .The Lemon test has continued to dog people of faith since then .In the 1980s , the Court barred the showing of the Ten Commandments in schools .It then barred moments of silence in schools , nativity scenes in government buildings , and certain religious symbols on government land .In the 1990s , it outlawed prayers at school graduation ceremonies , and in 2000 expanded that ban to forbid even voluntary , student - led prayer at Friday night football games .From 1989 until the present , the dominant test for Establishment Clause lawsuits has been the endorsement test .Under that test -- which is one of the many variations of the Lemon test -- a government act touching upon faith or religion is unconstitutional if it gives the appearance of a government endorsement .Many traditional religious displays were struck down during these years because they ran afoul of this defective test , as it is not difficult to mislabel many faith - based displays or expressions as \" endorsements . \"IV .Hope for a Significant Shift from the Roberts Court .That test will now likely shift in the Roberts Court .The Roberts Court has not yet taken up a major Establishment Clause issue , though history dictates that such a case will arrive soon enough .But now that Justice Samuel Alito has replaced Justice O'Connor , the swing vote on the Court ( and the sole moderate jurist ) is Justice Anthony Kennedy .Justice Kennedy has always dissented from the endorsement test , writing instead that the proper test is the coercion test ( another variation of Lemon ) , under which government actions touching upon faith are unconstitutional if those present feel coerced to participate or support it .Although still problematic , Justice Kennedy 's test is much friendlier to people of faith in every setting but one ( that one being public schools when children are present ) .In such a regime , situations such as the travesty unfolding in Florida referenced at the outset should be unthinkable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.942924"}

{"text": "But the 1962 decision was unsound in other ways as well .The provisions of the Constitution must be presumed , on principle , to be parts of the same coherent law , and interpreted as being consistent with each other and in no sense containing mutual contradictions .This consideration of the principle of the consistency and coherence of the Constitution 's provisions leads to an interesting question .Can the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause , which has been invoked to empower federal courts to decide religious matters in the states , be justly used to nullify the First Amendment 's prohibition against federal regulation of religion in the states ?But the Fourteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution as a consequence of the need , following the Civil War , to protect the freed slaves from being deprived of their rights as citizens .Its purpose was not to empower the federal government to regulate religion .In any event , the Engel v. Vitale decision makes a muddle of the constitutional principle of equal protection .The plaintiffs in Engel protested through their lawyers that their sensibilities were offended by the recitation in public schools of a prayer approved by the State of New York .In ruling to protect the plaintiffs ' feelings , the Supreme Court was choosing to safeguard the sensibilities of one group of citizens at the expense of other citizens , whose sensibilities were doubtless offended by the decision to curtail the free exercise of religion in public schools .In its verdict in Engel the Court was declaring that the plaintiffs ' sensibilities had greater legitimacy than those of the parents who felt their children should recite the prayer affirming belief in God .It is difficult to see how this outcome constitutes equal protection .And when it comes to feelings , especially those touching upon religion , is it even possible to provide equal protection ?In any large population , what gratifies the religious sensibilities of one person or group of persons is bound to offend the sensibilities of another person or group of persons .If we attempt to solve this problem by banning all offensive expressions of religious belief , we are in effect abolishing freedom of religion as a right .To permit in public places only the expression of religious beliefs that are inoffensive to everyone is to forbid all public expressions of religion , because there are no universally inoffensive religious beliefs .Nothing in the Constitution warrants suppressing public religious exercises because they will be offensive to someone .Would we permit only the private circulation of petitions for the redress of grievances ?How about allowing only private publication and distribution of books ?Would we limit assemblies to private property only ?Legal arguments based on offended feelings have dubious constitutional legitimacy .No provision in the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizens immunity against having their religious or political sensibilities offended by the orderly , public expression of the political or religious beliefs of other citizens .To have meaningful rights with respect to freedom of religion , freedom of speech , freedom of the press , freedom of peaceable assembly , and freedom of petition , the equal protection of every citizen 's feelings is an inherently impossible goal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.616585"}

County if they did not remove the tiny cross from the county seal .The cross symbolized Los Angeles ' birth as a Spanish mission town .The county was forced to choose between paying to change the seal or paying to go to court and possibly pay exorbitant attorneys fees to the ACLU .In the end , the L.A. county supervisors , in a 3 - 2 vote , decided to ignore the will of the people of Los Angeles County and pay to change the seal instead of paying to go to court .They had been advised by their attorneys that if they lost in court they would not only have to change the seal but they would additionally have to pay attorneys fees of the ACLU .Mr. Speaker , I believe it is time to bring this extortion to an end .The Public Expression of Religion Act would make sure these cases are tried on their merits and are not merely used to extort behavior via settlements outside our judicial system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.396378"}

{"text": "The Supreme Court possesses vast power , but that does not include the ability to rewrite history .The nature of religious establishments in the history of Western civilization is clear and can not be altered by any court .An establishment of religion is a declaration by a government , in a law , of a preference for one particular religion , which the law names .This declaration of a preference is substantial and not just nominal , because the establishment law grants the preferred religion some substantial benefit that government alone can confer .The establishment law confers the benefit on the identified religion only ; the churches of other religions , and persons unaffiliated with any organized religion , are excluded from receiving it .Typically , the benefit bestowed is the privilege of receiving institutional support from public revenues or the privilege to vote and hold public office - sometimes a combination of both .No establishment of religion exists when a government treats the members of every faith equally , tolerates free , public expression of any religious faith , and enacts no establishment law bestowing a substantial governmental benefit on one religion to the exclusion of all others .The churches representing the religions established through these state laws were all supported by donations of money from the public treasuries of the seven states that had privileged them as the preferred churches of their governments .Only Massachusetts and Connecticut , however , had what could be termed strong religious establishments , since the establishment laws in those states gave preference to just one church and made membership in it a qualification for voting and holding public office .Thus , it is a plain matter of historical record that since 1833 no establishment law has existed anywhere in the United States ; hence , there have been no establishments of religion since that date .Yet that was what the Supreme Court held in its 1962 judgment in Engel and in its 1985 judgment in Wallace v. Jaffree .The former held unconstitutional voluntary participation in group prayer and the latter , individual silent prayer , in public schools when approved by school officials .In Engel v. Vitale the Supreme Court misconstrued \" an establishment of religion \" to mean the approval of religious exercises by public officials , even though their approval conferred no exclusive benefit on any religious congregation .In Engel , the Supreme Court moved from protecting religious exercises in public schools , under the First Amendment 's Free - Exercise Clause , to condemning them as religious establishments .But before discussing how this reversal came about , the historical purpose of the First Amendment 's two religion clauses must be carefully examined , especially their relationship to each other .In this regard , we must first note the reason for the addition to the Constitution of the set of amendments known as the Bill of Rights , which includes the First Amendment .A set of amendments to protect the rights of individuals and states was repeatedly urged in 1787 - 88 during the debates in the state ratifying conventions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.818275"}

{"text": "\" This really sends a clear message that any kind of government - sponsored or government - facilitated religious expression in a public school is unconstitutional , \" says Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State .\" It casts very serious doubt on whether high school graduations may even include prayers .\" In the space below , we explore some very interesting and complex First Amendment issues that are implicated in a recent lawsuit in Texas .The suit was brought by a group of public high school ( Kuntze High School ) cheerleaders against the school district that told them to stop displaying religious - themed banners bearing bible verses and proclaiming things like \" If G - d is for us , Who Can Be Against Us ? \" at football games .The cheerleaders who filed suit seeking to continue the practice claim not only that the Establishment Clause does not forbid what they are doing , but also that that they have a First Amendment right themselves , under the Free Speech Clause , to continue to display the banners .As we explain below , we think - in light of the facts that are alleged by the cheerleaders in their Complaint - that under existing Supreme Court case law , both the Establishment Clause and the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment cut against the cheerleaders in this case .( We should make clear that although some of the current Justices might disagree with the case law currently on the books , we analyze the cheerleaders ' dispute under current doctrine that is binding on lower courts and litigants . )The Establishment Clause Analysis .Our starting point is that if the school officials themselves had decided - or had directed the cheerleaders - to use banners that included religious messages , this would violate the Establishment Clause .It seems pretty clear under current case law that such state action would be unconstitutional .But the cheerleaders ( supported by positions adopted by Governor Rick Perry and the Texas Attorney General ) argue that this situation is different , because the banners constitute private speech on behalf of the cheerleaders that is not attributed to the school .Under the selection procedures used by Kuntze High School , cheerleaders are not selected by school officials , but rather are chosen , after tryouts , by a panel of ( Lamar ) University cheerleaders .According to the allegations in the Complaint , Kuntze cheerleaders decide what goes on the banners ; there is no control exercised by school employees over the content of the displays .Moreover , the banners are paid for by cheerleaders , using money that comes from private sources , rather than public school funding .And the school district regulations identify activities such as banner displays at football games as a limited public forum , suggesting that the school is permitting individual students to speak , but not associating itself with the messages students express .Even in light of these facts , we think the cheerleaders ' display of bible - verse - bearing banners raises serious Establishment Clause problems .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.32914"}
{"text": "( The Free Exercise Clause generally prohibits the government from discriminating on the basis of religion . )RLUIPA grew out of the U.S. Supreme Court 's interpretations of RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause , and is now at the center of many controversies over how the government regulates religious use of land .To examine how RLUIPA relates to the Christian Science church 's lawsuit , the Pew Forum turns to church - state scholar Robert W. Tuttle .Featuring : Robert W. Tuttle , David R. and Sherry Kirschner Berz Research Professor of Law and Religion , The George Washington University Law School .Interviewer : Jesse Merriam , Research Associate , Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life .Question & Answer .What prompted the U.S. Congress to pass the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 ( RLUIPA ) ?RLUIPA 's story begins with a Supreme Court case called Employment Division v. Smith ( 1990 ) .In that case , the high court rejected the \" compelling interest \" test , which was the prevailing standard for evaluating cases involving the Free Exercise Clause .Under the compelling interest test , a law that substantially burdens an individual or group 's ability to practice religion may not apply to the burdened persons unless the government demonstrates a compelling interest in applying the law to these individuals or groups .Only a few interests , such as public health and safety , have traditionally been considered compelling , so a consistent application of this approach would have exempted religious groups from many laws .In Smith , the court rejected this approach , declaring that the free exercise analysis should not turn on whether a law substantially burdens a particular religious group or practice but rather on whether a law discriminates against a religious group or practice .Such a discriminatory law , the court explained , is invalid unless the government proves that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest .But for laws that do n't discriminate on the basis of religion , the high court held that the Free Exercise Clause requires merely that courts apply the much less demanding \" rational basis \" test .This stipulates that a law is valid as long as it reasonably relates to some legitimate government interest - even if it substantially burdens religious exercise .According to the ruling in Smith , almost all nondiscriminatory laws satisfy the Free Exercise Clause , thus dramatically limiting the reach of the clause .How did the ruling in Smith lead to the passage of RLUIPA ?The Smith decision infuriated many religious liberty advocates , prompting Congress in 1993 to pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) , which sought to reinstate the compelling interest test .In 1997 , however , the Supreme Court held in City of Boerne v. Flores that RFRA could not constitutionally apply to state and local governments .In 2000 , Congress took up this challenge by passing RLUIPA , a narrower version of RFRA .RLUIPA reinstates the compelling interest test 's application to all levels of government - federal , state and local .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.458084"}

{"text": "Assessing The Two Clauses of the First Amendment Together .Of course , the school might avoid the restrictions imposed by the Free Speech Clause that we just described by accepting responsibility for the cheerleaders ' banners .Even though government can not give unbridled discretion to a group of private individuals to control speech on public property , government can engage in its own speech , and in so doing necessarily engages in content or viewpoint discrimination when it expresses or sponsors its own message .The Free Speech Clause does not limit the state 's discretion to express its own messages on public property .But if the school accepts responsibility for the religious messages on the banners , then it endorses religion in violation of the Establishment Clause principles that we described earlier .Giving that kind of discretionary , long - term control over access to public property to any private group undermines our constitutional commitments to open access to public property for minorities , religious or otherwise .So under either characterization , it seems the only way for the school to obey the Constitution is to prohibit the religious display , which is why we think the cheerleaders could very likely lose their lawsuit if and when it winds its way up the appellate ladder .Vikram David Amar is the Iwan Foundation Professor of Law and the Dean at the University of Illinois College of Law .Previously , he served as the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Professor of Law at the University of California , Davis School of Law .He is a 1988 graduate of the Yale Law School and a former clerk to Justice Harry Blackmun .He is a co - author , along with William Cohen and Jonathan Varat , of a major constitutional law casebook , and a co - author of several volumes of the Wright & Miller treatise on federal practice and procedure .Before teaching , Professor Amar spent a few years at the firm of Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher .I think the cheeleaders will win in court .the Freedom from Religion organization started this action although evidently no one had complained or contacted them about the signs used for the football players to run through at the Kountze games .Thankfully , a legal organization Liberty Institute was contacted by the cheerleaders and is handling this matter on their behalf and this legal organization is well versed in constitutional arguments .EugeniaC .No , the cheerleaders will lose .The article that you posted beneath clearly explains why .Clyde B .I think the cheerleaders will lose in court .If the cheerleaders had racist messages and no one complained , it would be justified for an organization to step in and file suit .Thankfully , the Freedom from Religion organization stepped in to stop the cheerleaders from forcing others to be exposed to their discriminatory messages .How are their messages discriminatory ?One thing is having your own opinion : we all have that :-) .Another thing is striking out at others .The cheerleaders messages are full of positive values , and do n't strike out at others in any way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.054825"}

{"text": "It is not new in the constitutional history of this country , and it was not new in the Constitution of the United States when it became a part of the fourteenth amendment , in the year 1866 .The conclusion reached in this case by the Court is extremely relevant to the Kelo decision : .It is unfortunate that Davidson v. City of New Orleans was not cited by the Supreme Court in its Kelo decision .Privileges or Immunities .The Fourteenth Amendment can not be separated from its place in history .Consider the time in which the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted .The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery ( Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation did no such thing ) ; the Fourteenth Amendment made the freed slaves citizens on an equal basis with existing citizens .In the infamous case , Dred Scott v. Sandford ( 1857 ) , Chief Justice Taney related how Negroes . are not included , and were not intended to be included , under the word ' citizens ' in the Constitution , and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States .Notice the italicized words in the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment that are referenced in the second sentence : .All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside .The Fourteenth Amendment was intended to confer a narrow , limited set of privileges .But as no reference is made to the Bill of Rights in the Fourteenth Amendment , and no mention of rights occurs in the text of the same , this is just as speculative as the similar claim for the \" due process \" clause .When the phrase \" privileges or immunities \" was mentioned in the Fourteenth Amendment , it was not intended to be an isolated phrase the meaning of which to be decided by future Supreme Court justices .It is found in the Constitution , which , it should be noted , did not have any amendments when it was adopted but only contained a preamble and seven articles .The opening paragraph of the second section of Article IV of the Constitution reads as follows : \" The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States .\" This clause was itself taken from Article IV of the Articles of Confederation : .Here we have the general followed by the specific , thus limiting the \" privileges and immunities . \"And according to the principle set down by James Madison in the Federalist No .41 : .Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase , and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars .But the idea of an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor qualify the general meaning , and can have no other effect than to confound and mislead , is an absurdity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.08583"}

{"text": "The United States -- including its territories -- is divided into 94 judicial districts .The holdings of the district courts only bind that district , and everyone enjoys a right of appeal .Those districts are grouped into twelve appellate circuits .The appellate decisions of the U.S. courts of appeals are then binding on that court and all of the states and lower courts within them .And the entire nation is then bound by our highest tribunal , the United States Supreme Court .The common law system usually provides stability for our country 's laws under the doctrine of stare decisis .A lower court is inescapably bound by the precedents of whatever higher courts can claim jurisdiction over it .And under the doctrine of stare decisis ( which loosely translated is Latin for \" let the decision stand \" or \" stand by the decision \" ) a court must adhere to its own precedent unless there is a special justification for overruling it .Stare decisis rests on the premise that it is usually better for a question of law to be settled , than for that question to be settled correctly .That doctrine is the font of much of the security America enjoys under the rule of law .Yet there should be a measured reliance on stare decisis to prevent us from going too far afield from the purpose and meaning of the Constitution .Stare decisis is a general policy , not an inexorable command , as the Supreme Court restated as recently as 1997 in Agostini v. Felton .The Constitution was deliberately written to achieve certain things , mostly concerning either the structure and duties of government or certain specific , enumerated rights possessed by individuals .But where is the balance drawn ?Each judge -- and more regularly each Supreme Court justice , because it is more often the case that only the Supreme Court is truly free to reconsider these matters -- draws the line in a different place .It is a balancing of precedent ( protected by stare decisis ) versus first principles .Take an illustrative example .Justice Clarence Thomas ( the most conservative member of the Court ) is perhaps its most outspoken proponent of advancing first principles through constitutional interpretation .He is so often willing to overturn precedent to return to first principles on a given issue that Justice Antonin Scalia ( the second - most conservative member ) has said that Justice Thomas does n't believe in stare decisis .Justice Scalia was knowingly exaggerating with that statement , but he used it to make the point that , relative to where Justice Scalia draws the line , Justice Thomas seems to not feel obligated at all to adhere to precedents that Justice Thomas believes to be wrongly decided .Yet this is a relative standard .In 2006 , the Supreme Court decided the campaign finance case Randall v. Sorrell , challenging a Vermont law limiting campaign contributions .( Conservatives have always considered Buckley to be an egregiously - wrong decision . )Although the Court struck down the Vermont statute as excessively burdening the First Amendment , it also voted 7 - 2 to uphold Buckley .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.29239"}
{"text": "Furthermore , in claiming that the definition of an establishment of religion included aid to all religions , Black contradicted the Court 's own ruling in Everson !For aid to all religions was precisely what the New Jersey law was providing in paying for the cost of transporting students to religious schools , regardless of the religion they professed .And that was why the Court had decided in Everson that the law did not represent a religious establishment .By defining an establishment of religion as aid to all religions , Justice Black was contradicting both history and the very ruling for which he was writing the majority opinion .By relying in 1962 , in Engel v. Vitale , on Hugo Black 's grossly inflated definition of religious establishment in his 1947 Everson decision , the Supreme Court was building its precedents on an illogical foundation .But the 1962 decision was unsound in other ways as well .The provisions of the Constitution must be presumed , on principle , to be parts of the same coherent law , and interpreted as being consistent with each other and in no sense containing mutual contradictions .This consideration of the principle of the consistency and coherence of the Constitution 's provisions leads to an interesting question .Can the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause , which has been invoked to empower federal courts to decide religious matters in the states , be justly used to nullify the First Amendment 's prohibition against federal regulation of religion in the states ?But the Fourteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution as a consequence of the need , following the Civil War , to protect the freed slaves from being deprived of their rights as citizens .Its purpose was not to empower the federal government to regulate religion .In any event , the Engel v. Vitale decision makes a muddle of the constitutional principle of equal protection .The plaintiffs in Engel protested through their lawyers that their sensibilities were offended by the recitation in public schools of a prayer approved by the State of New York .In ruling to protect the plaintiffs ' feelings , the Supreme Court was choosing to safeguard the sensibilities of one group of citizens at the expense of other citizens , whose sensibilities were doubtless offended by the decision to curtail the free exercise of religion in public schools .In its verdict in Engel the Court was declaring that the plaintiffs ' sensibilities had greater legitimacy than those of the parents who felt their children should recite the prayer affirming belief in God .It is difficult to see how this outcome constitutes equal protection .And when it comes to feelings , especially those touching upon religion , is it even possible to provide equal protection ?In any large population , what gratifies the religious sensibilities of one person or group of persons is bound to offend the sensibilities of another person or group of persons .If we attempt to solve this problem by banning all offensive expressions of religious belief , we are in effect abolishing freedom of religion as a right .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.3525"}
{"text": "\" You might have wondered what an \" infamous \" crime is .The 5th Amendment says that people can not be charged with an \" infamous \" crime , unless indicted by a grand jury .In United States v. Moreland , 1924 , the Supreme Court ruled that an infamous crime is one in which the punishment for the crime could be a prison sentence .History of the Grand Jury Clause .Why was the Grand Jury Clause added by the Founding Fathers to the Bill of Rights ?The idea of the grand jury goes back into English history , as do all the provisions in the Bill of Rights .The Grand Jury first came to use in England around 1000 - 1100 AD .It was used as a tool by the King to find evidence against those who disagreed with him .Jurors were required to bring in information about their neighbors , basically acting as spies .It was strictly an accusatory businesss .In these early days , everything was stacked in favor of the king and a lot of people were probably judged guilty , not because of any criminal guilt , but because they were somehow deemed to be a threat by the king .Within a few hundred years , the grand jury system had evolved into a system of protection from overzealous prosecution .The system came to be viewed as a safeguard for citizens against the government .It was viewed as a safeguard because the grand jury made a group of citizens responsible for looking at the evidence and concluding whether or not someone should be charged , rather than a government official .If a corrupt government official could bring the charges alone , without the grand jury to act as an intermediary protection , he could accuse someone for unfair reasons .With the grand jury system , frivolous or unfair charges were greatly reduced .During the early years of American colonization , the grand jury concept was also imported from England .It was used throughout early American history and was mostly judged to be a protection against faulty prosecutions , rather than as an accusatory tool of government prosecutors .Some , though , viewed it as an arm that the prosecutor could lean on to do the investigatory work that he did n't want to do .Grand Jury Clause - The Zenger case .Grand juries became important tools to Americans before the Revolutionary War to protect themselves from what they believed were unjust royal laws .The most famous case involving a grand jury before the American Revolution , was the John Peter Zenger case .In this case , Zenger was a newspaper publisher who had published material critical of the Royal Governor of New York .The Governor tried to prosecute Zenger of seditious libel in 1734 .Not once , but three times , grand juries refused to indict Zenger , even though he was technically guilty .Instead , they believed that citizens should be able to speak freely .This case impressed upon the colonists how much power they could have in their own hands to protect themselves from unpopular measures of the Royal government .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.36188"}

Pre- Smith understanding The first Supreme Court case that addressed the issue of free exercise was Reynolds v. U.S. ( 1878 ) , in which the Court upheld a federal law banning polygamy over objections by Mormons who claimed that the practice was their religious duty .The Court in Reynolds distinguished between religious belief and religious conduct or action , stating that Congress was \" deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion , but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive to good order .\" Recognizing the religious defense , the Court said , would \" permit every citizen to become a law unto himself .\" While the government could not punish citizens because of their religious beliefs , it could regulate religiously motivated conduct , provided that it had a rational basis for doing so .This \" rational basis test \" became the standard for determining whether a law that impinged on a religious practice violated the free - exercise clause .As that standard was easy for the government to satisfy , for almost a century the courts generally rejected religious - freedom claims against generally applicable laws .In effect , the Supreme Court did not have opportunity to review this issue until the mid-20th century , when various free - exercise clause cases made their way through the state courts to the Supreme Court .In its 1963 decision Sherbert v. Verner , the Supreme Court found that the Constitution afforded at least some degree of government accommodation of religious practices .Adele Sherbert , a Seventh - day Adventist , was discharged by her South Carolina employer because she would not work on Saturday , her faith 's Sabbath .When she could not find other employment that would not require her to work on Saturday , she filed a claim for unemployment benefits .South Carolina law provided that a person was ineligible for benefits if he or she failed , without good cause , to accept available suitable employment when offered .The state denied Sherbert benefits , saying she had not accepted suitable employment when offered , even though she was required to work on her Sabbath .The decision was upheld by the South Carolina Supreme Court .The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court decision .Thus , in Sherbert , the Court adopted a \" compelling interest \" standard that government must meet when a generally applicable law unintentionally burdened a claimant 's religious practices and beliefs .The state in Sherbert could not demonstrate such compelling interest : the mere possibility that allowing exemptions to the unemployment compensation laws for Saturday worshipers might result in fraudulent or spurious claims was not sufficiently compelling , the Court reasoned .It is interesting and important to note the legal and social context in which Justice Brennan articulated this \" compelling state interest \" standard for free - exercise clause claims .The civil rights litigation of the 1950s and 1960s had greatly informed the Court 's perspective .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.23746"}

Miller , decided in 1939 , the court unanimously held that Congress could prohibit the possession of a sawed - off shotgun because that sort of weapon had no reasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated Militia .When I joined the court in 1975 , that holding was generally understood as limiting the scope of the Second Amendment to uses of arms that were related to military activities .Organizations such as the National Rifle Association disagreed with that position and mounted a vigorous campaign claiming that federal regulation of the use of firearms severely curtailed Americans Second Amendment rights .In recent years two profoundly important changes in the law have occurred .In 2008 , by a vote of 5 to 4 , the Supreme Court decided in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment protects a civilians right to keep a handgun in his home for purposes of self - defense .And in 2010 , by another vote of 5 to 4 , the court decided in McDonald v. Chicago that the due process clause of the 14th Amendment limits the power of the city of Chicago to outlaw the possession of handguns by private citizens .I dissented in both of those cases and remain convinced that both decisions misinterpreted the law and were profoundly unwise .Public policies concerning gun control should be decided by the voters elected representatives , not by federal judges .In my dissent in the McDonald case , I pointed out that the courts decision was unique in the extent to which the court had exacted a heavy toll in terms of state sovereignty . . . .Even apart from the States long history of firearms regulation and its location at the core of their police powers , this is a quintessential area in which federalism ought to be allowed to flourish without this Courts meddling .Whether or not we can assert a plausible constitutional basis for intervening , there are powerful reasons why we should not do so .Across the Nation , States and localities vary significantly in the patterns and problems of gun violence they face , as well as in the traditions and cultures of lawful gun use . . . .The city of Chicago , for example , faces a pressing challenge in combating criminal street gangs .Most rural areas do not .Once overshadowed by the hot - button gun rights debate , laws restricting knife sales and possession are the new \" second front \" in the battle to preserve Second Amendment rights .And they 've seen a string of successes .We ve introduced the Second Amendment to a significant number of people who never considered it their amendment , said Doug Ritter , who founded Knife Rights in Arizona in 2009 .The group argues that possessing and carrying any kind of blade is , as with guns , a right enshrined in the Constitution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.07721"}
{"text": "Several cases involving the Witnesses gave the Court the opportunity to rule on the application of the Free Exercise Clause .Subsequently , the Warren Court adopted an expansive view of the clause , the \" compelling interest \" doctrine ( whereby a state must show a compelling interest in restricting religion - related activities ) , but later decisions have reduced the scope of this interpretation .Contents .The first case to closely examine the scope of the Free Exercise Clause was Reynolds v. United States in 1879 .A case dealing with the prosecution of a polygamist under federal law , and the defendant 's claim of protection under the Free Exercise Clause , the Court sustained the law and the government 's prosecution .The Court read the Free Exercise Clause as protecting religious practices , but that did n't protect Reynolds ' , practices which were crimes .This interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause continued into the 1960s and the ascendancy of the Warren Court under chief justice Earl Warren .As Justice William Brennan stated for the majority , \" to condition the availability of benefits upon this appellant 's willingness to violate a cardinal principle of her religious faith effectively penalizes the free exercise of her constitutional liberties .\" This test was used through the years of the Burger Court , including particularly in the landmark case of Wisconsin v. Yoder ( 1972 ) .This view of the Free Exercise Clause would begin to narrow again in the 1980s , culminating in the 1990 case of Employment Division v. Smith .Examining a state prohibition on the use of peyote , the Supreme Court upheld the law despite the drug 's use as part of a religious ritual , and without employing the strict scrutiny test .Instead , the Court again held that a \" neutral law of general applicability \" generally does not implicate the Free Exercise Clause .This was followed by intense disapproval from Congress and the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993 to attempt to restore the prior test .However , in City of Boerne v. Flores , the Supreme Court struck down the act as applied to the States , holding that it unconstitutionally attempted to usurp the Supreme Court 's role in interpreting the Constitution , thus leaving the Smith test in place .During the twentieth century , many major cases involving the Free Exercise Clause were related to Jehovah 's Witnesses .Many communities directed laws against the Witnesses and their preaching work .From 1938 to 1955 , the organization was involved in over forty cases before the Supreme Court , winning a majority of them .The first important victory came in 1938 , when in Lovell v. City of Griffin , the Supreme Court held that cities could not require permits for the distribution of pamphlets .In 1939 , the Supreme Court decided Schneider v. Town of Irvington , in which it struck down anti - littering laws that were enforced only against Jehovah 's Witnesses who were handing out pamphlets .In 1940 , the Court considered Cantwell v.

{"text": "Or the school could delegate to a student group the authority to decide upon whatever banners the group 's members want to hang on the interior walls of the school building .The Court rejected this kind of an argument in Santa Fe v. Doe when it held that a public high school could not avoid Establishment Clause requirements by ceding the power to decide whether or not to have a prayer at school football games to the student body .Free Speech Analysis .But what about the free speech rights of the cheerleaders ?Plaintiffs argue that because the speech on the banners is not attributable to the school , it is private speech protected by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment .They thus suggest that they have a constitutional right to control the content of these banners free from government interference .No one else besides the cheerleaders gets to place their banners in front of the football players entering the field ; only the high school cheerleaders get access to this location for whatever expressive message they choose to communicate or facilitate .This kind of selective control of , and access to , public property for private expressive purposes is constitutionally problematic .Let us be clear : This is not a situation in which the school here is passively opening up a public location and event to allow various private speakers to express their various messages .No one gets access to have their message expressed on banners that the team will run through without the cheerleaders ' permission .The cheerleaders have complete discretionary control over the messages that may be communicated on banners leading the team in each and every football game .The cheerleaders can express sectarian messages of only one faith while rejecting suggestions of messages of other faiths .They can embrace the virtues of one race and denigrate the worth of others .They can express political messages for particular parties or candidates while rejecting messages from competing candidates or parties .They can adopt suggestions from their parents , friends , or pastors while ignoring messages proposed by people whose views they find objectionable .This kind of unbridled latitude given to a select group of private citizens but denied to others to use public property resources for expressive purposes is inconsistent with free speech values and , indeed , quite possibly itself would violate the Free Speech Clause .In other words , far from creating a free speech First Amendment right on the part of the cheerleaders , the school 's actions ( under the cheerleaders ' characterization of them ) here might themselves create a violation of the Free Speech Clause .That danger is n't meaningfully avoided when government confers unbridled discretion to decide what messages are permitted to be expressed on public property upon a private group , rather than upon a government official .Indeed , to return to the Establishment Clause , this is precisely the kind of unbridled discretion given to select private individuals that the Court rejected in Santa Fe v. Doe .Nor should it make any difference whether the group making the decision is selected on the basis of cheerleader athletic skills , or some other characteristic such as school spirit or how loud the students can yell .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.14357"}

{"text": "This disagreement was most evident when the Court applied the right to limit state ( as opposed to federal ) law .Justices Frankfurter and Harlan argued that association constrained state action because like other rights , it could be derived from the \" liberty \" of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .Justices Black , Douglas , Brennan , and Warren insisted that association was located in some aspect of the First Amendment and argued that it be given the same \" preferred position \" as other First Amendment rights .On their view , association applied to the states because the Fourteenth Amendment had incorporated the provisions of the First Amendment .These differences encompassed not only the source of the constitutional limits on state action but also the extent of those limits .For Black , the rights in the First Amendment were \" absolute \" and could not be restricted by state action .Frankfurter argued instead for a \" balancing \" that weighed the interests of the government against the liberty of the Fourteenth Amendment .The result of these two perspectives was that the Court was more likely to uphold a state law restricting expressive freedom if it followed the liberty argument and more likely to strike down the law if it followed the incorporation argument .The theoretical factor influencing the shaping of association was the pluralism popularized by David Truman and Robert Dahl in the 1950s and 1960s .But mid - twentieth - century pluralism merged these insights with currents from Arthur Bentley 's \" science of politics \" and Louis Hartz 's \" Lockean consensus . \"The resulting political theory emphasized the balance and consensus among groups rather than the juxtaposition of groups against the state .These assumptions laid the foundation for the freedom of association in two ways .First , they established a normative presumption that groups were valuable to democracy only to the extent that they reinforced and guaranteed democratic premises and , conversely , that groups antithetical to these premises were neither valuable to democracy nor worthy of its protections .Second , because this normative presumption excluded groups beyond the margins of consensus , pluralists saw the possibility of harmony and balance among those groups that remained .The second constitutional period of the right of association is the equality era , which began in the mid-1960s .The equality era introduced its own political , jurisprudential , and theoretical factors to the right of association .The primary political factor involved ongoing efforts to attain meaningful civil rights for African Americans .As the Civil Rights Movement gained traction , the focus of activists shifted from protecting their own associational freedom ( as represented in cases like NAACP v. Alabama ) to challenging segregationists ' right to exclude African Americans from group membership .Questions over the limits of this right to exclude became increasingly complex when civil rights litigation moved from public accommodations to private groups .The jurisprudential factor in the equality era involved the right to privacy .Although privacy and association had been linked in some of the Court 's earliest cases on the freedom of association , new connections emerged when the Court first recognized a constitutional right to privacy in its 1965 decision Griswold v. Connecticut .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.06827"}

{"text": "That fear of arbitrary power which is so marked in American political expression had been shaped to a large degree by the experience men of dissenting sections had had with persecution .Freedom of religion became for them a central example of freedom in general , and it was hardly accidental that the libertarian writers who meant so much to the colonials so often stemmed from the tradition of religious dissent .This other history that Koppelman omits points toward yet another political theory that objects to consensus liberalism : radical democracy .My book locates the right of assembly in the political theory of Sheldon Wolin , who both fears the expansion of power in unforeseen and uncontrolled channels and offers a counternarrative to the stories perpetuated by consensus liberals like Dahl and Rawls .Wolin 's work illuminates neglected constitutional values and highlights the importance of challenging the ways in which consensus liberalism characterizes groups and their forms of expression .After laying out a political theory of assembly , I revisit the historical and jurispurdential developments that locate theory in the actual politics of the United States .The call for greater group autonomy through the right of assembly is not without limiting principles .The text of the First Amendment offers one : assemblies must be peaceable .Our constitutional , social , and economic history suggests another : antidiscrimination norms should typically prevail when applied to commercial entities .Other questions are more difficult to answer .Among the most difficult is whether the right of assembly tolerates racial discrimination by peaceable , noncommercial groups .Our constitutional history supports a plausible argument that \" race is just different , \" that the state 's interest in eliminating racial discrimination justifies a nearly total ban on racially segregated private groups .As Justice Stewart wrote in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. , \" Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery , and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation . . . .When racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin , then it too is a relic of slavery .\" We might plausibly treat race differently when considering the boundaries of group autonomy .I would be quick to do so as a matter of personal preference - I can think of no racially discriminatory group to which I attach personal value or worth .But treating race differently in all areas ultimately undercuts a vision of assembly that protects pluralism and dissent against state - enforced orthodoxy .We can not move from the premise that genuine pluralism matters to an effort to rid ourselves of the groups that we do n't like .The question of racial discrimination , specifically discrimination by whites against African Americans , is one of the most difficult issues confronting any argument for greater group autonomy .As I explain in Chapter 5 , my proposal permits some racially discriminatory groups .It is an argument rooted in social change - the belief that today we are a society different from the one we were in 1960 and that we will continue to hold the ground that has been won .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.31746"}
{"text": "A law having a merely \" rational , \" important , \" \" valid \" or \" legitimate \" purpose could not withstand a claim that it infringed on a fundamental right .In 1972 , the Court reaffirmed that a generally applicable law , \" neutral on its face \" may nonetheless violate the First Amendment if such law \" unduly burdens the practice of religion . \"In Wisconsin v. Yoder , the Court held that the state 's interest in requiring a child 's compulsory attendance at school through age 16 , though important , could not withstand a free - exercise claim by members of the Amish religious sect .An Amish family claimed that requiring their children to attend public schools after age 14 would expose them to \" worldly influences \" against their traditionalist beliefs and undermine the insular Amish community .The Court in Yoder noted that the purpose of mandatory education was to develop a productive , self - reliant citizenry , but that the state 's purpose must be examined in light of the particular circumstances of the case .Since the Amish had a 200-year tradition of training their adolescents to be productive members of their \" separated agrarian \" community , the government 's interests could still be achieved by requiring education only through age 14 .This would obviate the burden to the Amish community 's right to freely exercise its religion , while the state 's overriding interest would still be served .In a clear statement of its doctrine , the Court in Yoder held that \" [ o]nly those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion .After Sherbert and Yoder , the Court applied the religious - exemption doctrine by examining two questions : Has the government significantly burdened a sincerely motivated religious practice ?If so , is the burden justified by a compelling state interest ?Increasingly , however , the Court narrowed the concept of a \" significant burden \" to religion and in a series of decisions throughout the 1980s , the Court rejected many free- exercise claims on this basis .The Court also became more willing to label state interests as \" compelling \" in cases where religious practice was significantly burdened by a general law .The Smith revolution It was clear that the Supreme Court was struggling with the issue of requiring accommodations based on the compelling - interest standard .In its 1990 decision Employment Division v. Smith , still a highly controversial opinion , the Court ruled that it would no longer give heightened scrutiny to the government 's refusal to grant exemptions to generally applicable laws that unintentionally burden religious beliefs or practices .In Smith , two counselors were fired from their jobs with a private drug rehabilitation organization because they ingested peyote at a ceremony of the Native American Church .The two men , members of the Native American Church , were determined to be ineligible for unemployment benefits because they had been fired for work - related \" misconduct .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.31879"}

United States Jaycees in 1984 .The problem is that we simply do n't know .The opinions in Roberts lack any contextual analysis .The justices simply assumed that the state 's interest in eradicating gender discrimination warranted trumping the autonomy of the Jaycees .Nobody offered any explanation of why this remedy helped to eradicate gender discrimination in these circumstances sufficient to trump the autonomy of this group .Having mentioned these examples , let me be quick to note that I find aspects of my own proposed drawing of lines incomplete and imprecise .For example , I am unsure how a theory of assembly would address highly regulated groups like political parties , labor unions , and professional associations .As Steven Calabresi notes , these kinds of groups present a particular challenge to questions of group autonomy : \" Some so - called mediating institutions may truly mediate between the private individual and the state .Synagogues , churches , temples , families , and voluntary community and civic associations and groups often fall readily into this category .Other groups , however , such as political parties , labor unions , bar associations , and other modern - day corporate ' guilds ' may not .It may often be the case that these kinds of groups do not so much ' mediate ' between the individual and the state , as that they try actually to enlist the state on their side of some otherwise - private competitive struggle .\" On the other hand , some highly regulated groups embody the very values and purposes that I defend throughout this book .In fact , in recent decades , the Court appears to have developed a distinct right of \" political association \" applicable to political parties .It may be that the principles of assembly that I have sketched here are capacious enough to encompass some highly regulated groups .It may be that the \" highly regulated \" distinction is itself problematic - after all , the state could simply start to regulate more groups more extensively .More pointedly , this kind of ambiguity is inherent in all line - drawing and to some extent plagues the distinction that I have proposed between commercial and noncommercial groups .I believe that the contextual analysis that I recommend - which accounts for some of the realities of the changing dynamics of power- addresses some of these concerns .But I hope that critics who disagree with my reasoning on this point will nonetheless take seriously the critiques in the rest of the book and either sharpen my proposed alternative or strengthen the explanations for the neolibertarian and message - based proposals .We need to find a better way forward in this area of the law .The aspiration of this book is to get us thinking in that direction , not to insist that I have arrived at the best possible solution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.32009"}

{"text": "Purpose of the Bill of Rights .The American Bill of Rights was introduced because of arguments that arose against the newly proposed US Constitution when it was first introduced .The Bill of Rights served two primary purposes , to define a list of specific individual rights that the government could not encroach upon and to alleviate the fears of the Constitution 's detractors so they would support it .After the Constitutional Convention produced the Constitution , it was sent to the states for their review .Each state formed its own Constitutional Convention to accept or reject the Constitution .They were known as \" ratification \" conventions , because to \" ratify \" means to accept .A lengthy debate began in each colony about the merits of the Constitution .The Constitution 's supporters were known as Federalists , because they supported a strong central government .The Federalists were led by such men as James Madison , Alexander Hamilton and John Jay .The Constitution 's detractors were known as anti - Federalists .They believed the Constitution gave too much power to the central government at the expense of the states and individuals and were led by such men as Patrick Henry , George Mason and Elbridge Gerry .Most people agreed that a stronger government was needed .The colonists had purposely created a weak central government because of their fear that the government could grow too powerful - the very reason for the Revolutionary War in the first place .After a while though , they realized the government they had created could barely function and as such , would not be able to protect them from foreign enemies or do anything else that a governments ought to do .This was the reason for the creation of the Constitution , to create a new , stronger government to replace the weak one under the Articles of Confederation .Once it was decided to make a stronger government , however , the citizens still had to decide how strong they wanted this government to be .Once the ratification debates began , it soon became apparent that the Constitution would not be accepted in several of the states because of this very concern - that the central government would be too powerful .Anti - federalists condemned the fact that the Constitution did not have a Bill of Rights , which is a list of specific rights of the people that are not to be violated by the government .To alleviate the fears of the anti - Federalists , the pro - Constitution forces promised that the First Congress would add a Bill of Rights to the Constitution if they would go ahead and accept it .This promise persuaded enough anti - Federalists to support the Constitution that it finally passed .Passage of the Bill of Rights .The First Congress began its session in March of 1789 .On June 8 , James Madison , the chief author of the Constitution , gave a speech to Congress in which he submitted 20 of the most requested amendments for consideration .You can read James Madison 's June 8 , 1789 speech here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.25222"}
{"text": "The Excessive Fines Clause .The Courts will not allow fines that are grossly disproportional to the seriousness of the offense .Even so , higher courts rarely overturn the decision of a lower court where fines are concerned .This is one of the least used provisions of the Bill of Rights .In fact , the Supreme Court never overturned a case for violating the Excessive Fines Clause until 1998 .The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause .Great Britain had a long and terrible history of cruel and unusual punishments inflicted on convicted criminals , things such as burning at the stake , chopping off body parts , crucifixion , castration , breaking on the wheel and so on .America 's Founding Fathers wanted to make sure no such punishments were inflicted in the United States .In general , a punishment is considered to be cruel and unusual if the majority of the public would deem it to be so , but if the majority of the public approves of a certain type of punishment , it is usually allowed .The Supreme Court has stated , based on this clause , that punishments must be in proportionality to the crime committed .Over time , the Court 's definition of \" cruel and unusual \" has changed .For example , the death penalty was allowed in all of the original 13 states for crimes other than murder , but today , it is not allowed for crimes other than murder or treason .It is also not allowed if the guilty was younger than the age of 18 or mentally incompetent at the time of the crime .Death by lethal injection , hanging , the firing squad and by the electric chair are still allowed today .9th Amendment .The 9th Amendment is one of the least referred to amendments in the Bill of Rights .It is also probably one of the most important and controversial .The 9th Amendment says , \" The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people .In plain language , it means that although the Constitution lists certain rights of the people that may not be violated by the government , there are also other rights of the people that are not listed , that the government may not violate either .The Founding Fathers believed that man inherently has natural rights by virtue of his being human and that the government should not violate those rights .They also thought it was impossible for them to list all such rights .Instead , they addressed some of the most important in the Constitution , but left the States to determine the rest , as is spelled out in the 10th Amendment .The problem is that the modern Supreme Court has taken it upon itself to determine what those extra , unlisted rights are and the States and the people have not challenged the Court in this endeavor .Today , a small handful of unelected judges often throws out the laws passed by the people through their legislatures in the name of \" protecting civil rights . \" In reality , the Courts often violate the will of the people by throwing out their laws and forcing their own will upon the people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.34009"}
{"text": "For that reason , to any objective outside observer , the cheerleaders and the banners they display bear the imprimatur of the school .In a case ( Hazelwood ) permitting public high school officials to censor high school newspaper articles - even though the articles bore the bylines of individual student authors - the Supreme Court reasoned that school - sponsored activities implicate government promotion of speech , rather than just the toleration of speech .As a result , even if the school disclaims any approval of a student 's message , the overall public imprimatur remains .Putting a disclaimer on the school newspaper does n't change its status as a school - sponsored activity any more than a one - paragraph disclaimer can transform high school football games from school - sponsored activities into private events .Although the high school newspaper could be considered to be part of the school 's curriculum , which creates an even greater imprimatur of school support- and football games are less easily characterized as part of the school curriculum - we think the analogy has some force .What about the fact that the school does not pay for the banners ?We think that under existing case law , the private nature of the funding of religious displays does not necessarily control the Establishment Clause analysis .The key point is that the religious message is displayed on public property during a school - sponsored event , a football game .Cases involving the prominent display on public property of privately created nativity scenes ( such as the Allegheny County case ) demonstrate that private religious displays , standing alone on public property , can violate the Establishment Clause .Another key factor to be considered under the Supreme Court 's cases is the extent to which other students might be made to feel unwelcome because religious banners are displayed as part of the organized , pre - game activities .Santa Fe Ind.

{"text": "He argued that , once the Constitution had secured the freedom of speech , a separate provision for freedom of assembly would be redundant .And its subject matter was religious rather than political and therefore beyond the proposed protection for assemblies gathered to discuss the common good .Page also seemed to realize that governments even in the new American republic might be prone to restrict the freedom on various pretexts\"which is why a separate enumeration would be valuable .The sole limitation was that the assemblies be peaceable .The right of the people peaceably to assemble in public spaces escaped being merged into a more general freedom of speech .What difference did this make ?First , freedom of assembly by its nature involves public spaces , like the public street in which the founder of Pennsylvania preached .If crowds of people are to assemble , they must assemble somewhere .In early America that somewhere was ordinarily the village green , the commons , the streets , the wharves , or the parks , not just private spaces like taverns , coffeehouses , churches , and courthouses .A right of assembly without a right of access to public spaces would be an empty right .But this is not a natural proposition .The government may prevent speakers from occupying public parks , streets , or commons to protect alternative uses of the land .Freedom of speech is ordinarily a negative freedom , not a positive claim on public property .In fact , the Court was wrong .In Britain , the people were not free to assemble in the streets and parks without official permission .Unauthorized groups of twelve or more could be charged and prosecuted , like Penn , for unlawful assembly .Colonial governors tried to suppress the Sons of Liberty on similar legal bases .The creation of the freedom of assembly embodied this legal change in the right of access .Second , freedom of assembly was understood to protect not only the assembly itself but also the right to organize assemblies through more or less continual associations and for those associations to select their own members by their own criteria .In this respect , the freedom of assembly is preparatory to the freedom of speech .The freedom of speech presumably suffices to protect what is said at an assembly .Freedom of assembly or association is necessary to protect the seedbed of free speech : the group that plans and guides the speech .This aspect of freedom of assembly was tested in the first decade of the republic .Typically they held public meetings every month and more frequently near elections or at times of political controversy , and in between the public meetings met among themselves to discuss ideas , principles , and strategies .Especially in the wake of the Whiskey Rebellion , President Washington and his Federalist allies came to view the Democratic - Republican societies as instigators of sedition , incipient American versions of the Jacobin clubs of revolutionary France .Washington called for legislative action against them .By the 1830s , French observer Alexis de Tocqueville regarded this freedom of association as the most distinctive feature of American public life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.17796"}

United States Jaycees .Justice Brennan 's opinion for the Court identified two separate constitutional sources for the right of association in earlier cases .One line of decisions protected \" intimate association \" as \" a fundamental element of personal liberty . \"Another set of decisions guarded \" expressive association , \" which was \" a right to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment - speech , assembly , petition for the redress of grievances , and the exercise of religion .\" Sixteen years later , the Court reaffirmed this fundamental distinction in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale .This book suggests that the loss of assembly and the uncritical embrace of the constitutional right of association have weakened group autonomy by suppressing dissent , depoliticizing action , and constraining expression .These changes are related to each other : they are all methods of control .They deny that \" the activity of rendering the world a meaningful place . by generating narratives and norms requires space for groups of people gathered apart from the state and bound to come into conflict with it . \"In other words , they open the door for the state to impose meaning , purpose , and value on groups and their activities .The thin protections of the right of association are underwritten by a political theory of consensus liberalism , which purports to be \" procedural \" or \" neutral \" but whose espoused tolerance extends only to groups that endorse the fundamental assumptions of liberal democratic theory .Consensus liberalism paves the way for the state to demand what Nancy Rosenblum has called a \" logic of congruence \" requiring \" that the internal life and organization of associations mirror liberal democratic principles and practices .\" It leaves us without all - male fraternities , all- male Jaycees , and all - Christian student groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.454735"}

{"text": "Based on these hearings , Congress determined that many state and local governments , in regulating land use and prisoners , were not sufficiently sensitive to religious freedom and tended to discriminate against unpopular or unknown faiths .Cutter v. Wilkinson ( 2005 ) .After several lower courts entertained challenges to RLUIPA 's constitutionality , with some upholding and others invalidating the statute , the Supreme Court agreed to hear one of these cases , Cutter v. Wilkinson ( 2005 ) .The case arose after Ohio prison officials claimed that the statute 's institutionalized persons provision could not constitutionally apply to how the state treats people incarcerated for committing a crime .In the lower court , the prison officials made a federalism argument that had prevailed in Boerne - that Congress had violated the constitutionally required division of power between the state governments and the federal government .Instead , the Ohio prison officials drew from Justice Stevens ' concurrence in Boerne and argued that RLUIPA 's institutionalized persons provision violated the Establishment Clause by favoring religion over nonreligion .In its decision in Cutter , the high court unanimously rejected this Establishment Clause challenge on the ground that RLUIPA 's institutionalized persons provision removed \" exceptional government - created burdens on private religious exercise . \" Mindful of potential constitutional problems , however , the court 's opinion in Cutter emphasized two existing Establishment Clause limitations on how courts may apply the institutionalized persons provision .First , the high court noted , the Establishment Clause prohibits discrimination based on religious affiliation and thus requires courts to apply RLUIPA in a way that \" does not differentiate among bona fide faiths .\"Second , the justices pointed out , the Establishment Clause prohibits religion - specific accommodations from imposing unreasonable costs on third parties , and courts therefore may not grant exemptions under RLUIPA in a way that endangers prison authorities or other prisoners .Lower courts have generally applied RLUIPA according to these two Establishment Clause limitations .For example , prisoners have been much more successful in pursuing RLUIPA claims when their requests have not raised security concerns than when their claims have raised such concerns .While Cutter upheld RLUIPA 's institutionalized persons provision , the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the land use provision , which applies to laws governing how religious individuals and entities may use land .The reasoning in Cutter , however , would appear to apply with equal force to the land use provision .This would suggest that this provision also complies with the Establishment Clause as long as there is sufficient evidence that land use laws place special burdens on religious entities .Although the Supreme Court has not yet taken a case dealing with the land use provision , many lower courts have decided such cases , and some of these lower court decisions have interpreted the language broadly to protect religious freedom .For example , in Sts .About Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues , attitudes and trends shaping America and the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.65784"}

{"text": "The Establishment Clause .The Establishment Clause states that Congress shall make no law \" respecting an establishment of religion .\" This clause is generally interpreted to mean three things . 1 )That the Congress may not establish an official religion or denomination and require people to support it or believe in it . 2 )The Congress may not favor in its laws one religion or denomination over another , and 3 ) Congress may not favor or disfavor believers or unbelievers in any religion or denomination over any other .History of the Establishment Clause .The historical reasons for this amendment are evident from English and colonial history , where at times , one religion was favored over others .For example , at alternating times , the official religion of England was Catholicism or Protestantism .People who dissented from the prevailing religion were often punished , taxed , imprisoned , tortured and killed for not conforming .In early America , most colonial governments had state supported religions .Tax dollars were used to support the state church .Some colonies had laws requiring church attendance .Punishments were meted out to those who did not agree with the tenets and practices of the state church .Generally , Puritanism prevailed in northern colonies and Anglicanism prevailed in the South .Baptists were persecuted in some places , Catholics in others and Quakers in still others .By the time the Constitution was created , many Americans had had enough of the state telling them what they had to believe or how they could or could not express their faith .Many called for an amendment to the Constitution that would specifically say that all Americans were guaranteed freedom in their religious choices .This meant they could believe how they chose and express their belief in the way they chose , even if they chose not to believe in a God at all .This is such a widely held belief today that few would challenge this idea .Establishment Clause Establishment of Religion - What does it mean ?Problems have arisen though in the process of determining exactly what the restriction of the government from \" establishing a religion \" means .For example , does it mean that students can not pray at school because the school is a state run institution ?Does it mean that cities can not display Nativity scenes at Christmas because it would appear that the state is endorsing Christianity ?Is government money earmarked to go toward education \" establishing a religion \" if the student receiving its benefit wants to go to a religious school ?All of these issues and many others have been discussed and argued about throughout American history , but especially in the last 60 or so years , when challenging religious expression of any kind became more in vogue .Most of the court cases involving the \" establishment of religion \" in recent years have had to do with religious expression in the public schools .There are two general camps on this Establishment Clause issue .One camp is the accommodationist camp .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.59906"}

Doe ( 2000 ) in support of her claim that the banners were unconstitutional .In Santa Fe , student - led prayers , organized by school officials , were conducted over the school 's public - address system at the beginning of sporting events .As should be apparent , this case differs from Matthews v. Kountze ISD ( 2012 ) in two important ways .One glaring difference is that it was a prayer , which encouraged participation from the audience .Despite the banners being on school property at a school - sponsored football game in Kountze , they should be considered private speech since the school had no direct involvement in their creation or display , or allow the cheerleaders to amplify their message via a school - owned public - address system .The question then becomes can a school prohibit private speech on its grounds ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.46199"}

Smith ( 1990 ) , which made it much more difficult for religious people to gain exemptions from laws that interfered with or burdened their religious liberty .The Smith decision upheld the denial of unemployment compensation to two Native American drug rehabilitation counselors who had been fired for ingesting the hallucinogen peyote as part of a religious ritual .( A more detailed analysis of the Smith case is available in the Pew Forum 's A Delicate Balance : The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme Court . )Viewing Smith as a dangerous limitation on religious freedom , Congress passed RFRA to restore the situation as it existed before Smith .Prior to Smith , courts applied the \" compelling interest \" standard when considering free exercise claims .For example , the Supreme Court applied the compelling interest standard in Wisconsin v. Yoder ( 1972 ) to exempt Amish children from a Wisconsin law requiring school attendance until age 16 .Furthermore , the court found , Wisconsin did not have a compelling interest in requiring Amish children to attend high school since the Amish community provides \" vocational education for [ its ] children in the adolescent years . \"( A more detailed analysis of the Yoder case is available in A Delicate Balance : The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme Court . )In Smith , however , the Supreme Court nearly eliminated the compelling interest standard by holding that the standard applies only to laws that specifically discriminate against a religious group or activity .All other laws , the court ruled , should be upheld against challenges based on the Free Exercise Clause if they merely further a \" legitimate government interest , \" which includes almost any government function , such as regulating for the public welfare .The upshot of Smith is that the government may substantially burden religious exercise as long as in doing so it treats religious practices just as it treats nonreligious ones .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.931656"}

{"text": "But it was Everson v. Board of Education , fifteen years earlier in 1947 , in which that expansive definition was first articulated .Everson v. Board of Education was the case that originally misconstrued and misapplied Jefferson 's wall metaphor .Everson concerned a New Jersey law that reimbursed from public money the cost of transporting children to \" schools other than public schools . \"Since most of the nonpublic schools in New Jersey in the 1940s were operated by the Roman Catholic Church , Arch Everson 's lawsuit raised the issue of whether a state government 's payment of transportation costs for students attending a religious school represented an establishment of religion .The Supreme Court decided it did not and so upheld the New Jersey law .In ruling against Everson , the Court found that state payment of transportation for children in religious schools was a public service similar to providing police and fire protection or sidewalks at public expense .It did not represent an endorsement of a particular religion by the state of New Jersey ; therefore , it was not an establishment of religion .In reaching this decision in Everson , however , the Court vigorously embraced the idea of separation of church and state and retailed a gross misunderstanding of the purpose of the First Amendment 's Establishment Clause .Crucial particulars of the Court 's opinion , written for the majority by Justice Hugo Black , were illogical and factually incorrect .Justice Black described an establishment of religion and separation of church and state in these terms : .The \" establishment of religion \" clause in the First Amendment means at least this : Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church .Neither can pass laws which aid one religion , aid all religions , or prefer one religion over another . . . .In the words of Jefferson , the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect \" a wall of separation between church and State . \" Black was historically in error in declaring that the First Amendment prohibited states from having an establishment of religion : in fact , the First Amendment was ratified by states that had religious establishments .He was also factually incorrect and made a monumental blunder of reasoning in stating that an establishment of religion encompassed aid to \" all religions .\" If that were true , the very point of having religious establishments would be contradicted .Furthermore , in claiming that the definition of an establishment of religion included aid to all religions , Black contradicted the Court 's own ruling in Everson !For aid to all religions was precisely what the New Jersey law was providing in paying for the cost of transporting students to religious schools , regardless of the religion they professed .And that was why the Court had decided in Everson that the law did not represent a religious establishment .By defining an establishment of religion as aid to all religions , Justice Black was contradicting both history and the very ruling for which he was writing the majority opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.521774"}
{"text": "Our Founding Fathers operated under this same sacred principle , as do many of the people in the so - called religious right today .Conclusion .The United States Constitution actually says \" in the year of our Lord , \" a direct reference to Jesus Christ as God .This phrase was not a \" mere convention \" as some people claim ; it was an expression of honor to the one true God .We can know this to be true because we know that many atheists today hate to make any such reference to Christianity .If references to Christianity in 1787 were mere convention , then lack of reference to Christianity today would also have to be mere convention .Just ask atheists why they want to remove \" In God we trust \" from our coins if such a removal represents \" mere convention .The Constitution also requires elected officials to take an oath of office .According to Bradford in Original Intentions , at the time the Constitution was written , to take an oath of office was to swear publicly by Almighty God .That is one reason the framers and ratifiers of the Constitution felt it unnecessary to require elected officials to also take a religious test in order to run for office .Why take a religious test when you have already sworn by God to uphold a document that expresses an explicit belief in the Christian Trinity ?Although the Constitution forbids the federal government from mandating a religious test , it does not prohibit state or local governments or American voters from applying a religious test .Therefore , it is fully constitutional for a state or local government or any Christian political group to require candidates to believe in the Trinity or any other Christian doctrine from the Bible .If other people do n't like the test , then they can fight it in the political arena , through the ballot box .David Barton shows in Original Intent : The Courts , the Constitution , & Religion that the idea of having no religious test meant only that the federal government could not force political candidates to become members of one Protestant denomination .Thus , when the Constitution forbids making a religious test , it did not mean that candidates must be non - Christians .It meant they could be Anglican , Baptist , Presbyterian , or a member of any other orthodox Christian denomination .The United States Constitution and the American political system were based on Christian principles .Included in those Christian principles are the following theological and moral imperatives : .Government power and sovereignty should be limited to the specific theological and moral commands of the Christian God .There should be a balance and separation of powers within the government so that a small group of evil people will be unable to tyrannize others .All citizens should have the right to own property and to buy and sell freely , according to the moral law of the Christian God .The right to life and property can not be abridged without due process .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.62442"}

Verner , greatly limiting the scope of that precedent .\" It would , Scalia claimed , make a citizen 's obligation to obey the law contingent on his religious beliefs .Scalia found that the Court had never in fact invalidated any government action on the basis of the Sherbert compelling - interest test except the denial of unemployment compensation ( that Smith was itself an unemployment compensation case is not addressed in the decision ) .The Smith case , the Court said , did not involve such a \" hybrid situation .Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , although concurring in the outcome , vigorously disagreed with the Court 's abandonment of the \" compelling interest \" standard , as did Justice Harry Blackmun in the dissent .Post-Smith implications In the three years following Smith , more than 50 reported free - exercise cases were decided against religious groups and individuals .The act , which was signed by President Clinton on Nov. 17 , 1993 , restored the compelling - interest test and ensured its application in all cases where religious exercise is substantially burdened .Also in 1993 , the Supreme Court re - visited the religious exemption issue in City of Hialeah .After a Santeria church announced plans to establish a house of worship in Hialeah , the city enacted an ordinance prohibiting the ritual slaughter or sacrifice of animals , which is one of the religion 's principal forms of devotion .The Supreme Court found that the history of the ordinance showed that it specifically targeted the Santeria practice of animal sacrifice while providing numerous exemptions for other instances of animal slaughter , including Kosher slaughter .Since the ordinance both burdened religious practice and was neither neutral nor generally applicable , the Court would apply \" strict scrutiny \" and the \" compelling interest \" standard to the city 's actions .The ordinances could not withstand such scrutiny , the Court stated , holding them invalid under the free - exercise clause .After City of Hialeah , the inquiry into whether a law is in fact \" neutral \" and \" generally applicable \" has provided claimants with ammunition in free - exercise clause claims ( see Fraternal Order of Police v. City of Newark , and Keeler v.

{"text": "The Supreme Court 's decision in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah ( 1993 ) is the relevant precedent on what counts as impermissible discrimination under the Free Exercise Clause and RLUIPA .In the Lukumi case , the high court invalidated an ordinance that prohibited animal sacrifice but permitted other types of animal killings .The court explained that the city , by focusing only on animal sacrifice in its ordinance , did not aim to protect animals in general but rather to prohibit the Santerian practice of animal sacrifice .Such targeted legislation , the court held , violates the Free Exercise Clause .Now compare the Hialeah ordinance with the district 's designation of the Christian Science church as a historic landmark .In one respect , the review board 's designation might appear to target a religious group because it singled out the Christian Science church in making this designation .But this is only a superficial similarity because all historic landmark decisions single out particular buildings as being worthy or unworthy as historic landmarks .To decide whether the district actually targeted the Christian Science church , we have to consider the criteria that the review board considers in determining whether a building is a historic landmark , and how the board applied the criteria to this particular building .The D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board 's report explaining its decision is relevant here .The report applies the same criteria to the church that the board applies to other buildings , religious and secular .Nothing in the report suggests that the board landmarked this building due to hostility toward religion in general or the Christian Science church in particular .So I doubt a court would find that the district violated RLUIPA or the Free Exercise Clause by targeting the Christian Science church .As I mentioned earlier , the real question is whether , under either RLUIPA or RFRA , the landmark designation has imposed a substantial burden on the church .Some Supreme Court decisions have interpreted the Establishment Clause to prohibit the government from favoring religion over nonreligion .RLUIPA appears to favor religion over nonreligion because it gives only religious groups a legal weapon against burdensome laws .Is there an argument that RLUIPA violates the Establishment Clause ?And have courts considered this argument ?There is certainly an argument that RLUIPA violates the Establishment Clause , but I think there is almost zero possibility of the argument persuading the Supreme Court or a lower court to invalidate RLUIPA as unconstitutional .In Cutter v. Wilkinson ( 2005 ) , the Supreme Court unanimously rejected this Establishment Clause argument as it applied to RLUIPA 's institutionalized persons provision .In that decision , the court explained that there is an area of church - state law known as the doctrine of accommodation , which permits the government to grant religious groups special protection from burdensome laws .Some examples of religious accommodations are military draft exemptions for conscientious objectors , tax exemptions for houses of worship or exemptions for religious employers from employment discrimination laws .The Supreme Court has considered constitutional challenges to such religious accommodations for over 50 years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.109024"}
{"text": "Here , Paine makes a statement affirming the divinity of the Bible , which he would later apparently condemn in his other , certainly more radical writings !Thus , Paine 's private belief in deism did not really affect the American Revolution or the U.S. Constitution .Paine was not a signer of the Declaration of Independence nor was he a signer of the U.S. Constitution .It is therefore not even accurate to call him a true Founding Father .Sometimes people say that John Adams , one of the leaders of the American War for Independence , was not a Christian .Such statements are based on a series of private letters Adams wrote to Jefferson between 1812 and 1814 , where Adams attacks the Christian doctrine of the Trinity .These letters , however , although they probably represent Adams ' personal view throughout most of his life , are a private correspondence .Publicly , Adams behaved differently .For instance , he was one of the main negotiators and signers of the 1783 Treaty of Paris , which opens with a statement supporting the doctrine of the Christian Trinity .Here again , we have an example of a Founding Father who keeps private any hint that he has unorthodox views about God , Jesus Christ , or Christianity .Thus , it is completely inappropriate to use these private writings as evidence because they contradict Adams ' public actions .Admittedly , the Founding Fathers were not solely influenced by Christian doctrine .They also had a great knowledge of history and political science , from the Ancient Roman Republic to their own century .Not only Russell Kirk but also Bernard Bailyn in The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution and Gordon Wood in The Creation of the American Republic , 1776 - 1787 point this out .Bailyn writes that the leaders of the American Revolution not only had great fears of a national body of bishops like that of the Church of England , they also had a great fear of parliamentary power and of using taxes to support national churches .This does n't mean , however , that they had a problem with using public funds to support Christianity because they did indeed occasionally use public money for that purpose .Bailyn also says the revolutionary leaders sometimes showed a superficial knowledge of Locke , Montesqieu , and Voltaire .Wood writes in his book that they found no problem combining the ideas of such writers with all sorts of facts from history and all sorts of quotes from the Bible to support their politics .Just because they used unorthodox writers to support their politics , therefore , does not mean that they were not founding a Christian nation .Significantly , Bailyn adds that the leaders of the Revolution believed \" that America had a special place , as yet not fully revealed , in the architecture of God 's intent ( Bailyn , 33 ) . \"In no way can such a belief be called deist .A deistic god does not have an architecture or design for a nation 's history .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.11382"}

O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal ( 2006 ) .The case arose after the federal government suppressed the importation of hoasca tea , which contains a hallucinogen that is used by a small religious group as a sacrament .Moreover , the government argued , permitting the group to import the tea would harm society in general , as it would undermine the government 's efforts to keep hallucinogens off the illicit drug market .Although the court found in favor of the religious group in O Centro Espirita , not many other religious organizations have prevailed under RFRA .Indeed , federal agencies have largely ignored the statute , and federal courts have often weakened RFRA by narrowly interpreting what constitutes a \" substantial burden on religious exercise , \" which is required to trigger the compelling interest inquiry .Indeed , courts have tended to find a substantial burden only when religious requirements directly conflict with legal requirements .For example , courts regularly reject prisoners ' RFRA claims if the challenged restriction interferes with optional religious practices , such as wearing a cross on a jewelry chain .At the state level , a dozen states across a broad political spectrum responded to the Smith decision by enacting their own RFRAs .These state RFRAs apply the pre-Smith compelling interest standard to all government action taken within that state .But state courts have often limited state RFRAs by narrowly interpreting what constitutes a substantial burden on religious exercise .Given the Boerne decision and the limited impact of the state RFRAs , Congress found that there was still a need for federal legislation applying the pre-Smith compelling interest standard , at least in some instances , to state and local governments .Congress hoped that if it created a law that applied this standard only in those circumstances in which religious liberty was most vulnerable , the Supreme Court would uphold the law as a permissible exercise of federal power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.706665"}
{"text": "Joshua Brooks .Nice to see someone post an opinion without getting personal or hostile .nekelund2 .People attending a high school football game , as well as the coaches , the players , the cheerleaders and the officials , are not mere passersby .You are turning the standard on its head by suggesting that the standard to be met is that non - passersby who are fully informed of the school 's internal policies and the history of the banners must feel that it is a violation of the Establishment Clause .To do so would effectively allow for promotion of sectarian religious values as long as the underlying policies are unknown to most and those that know them attest that it does n't violate the Establishment Clause .The passersby reference is to suggest that the determination must not be based on purely subjective or fleeting perception , but that of an objective , reasonable individual .The USSC would have no problem with the players / cheerleaders being sanctioned by the school if the sign said \" Bong Hits 4 Jesus \" .Were this an isolated incident , perhaps the school could argue plausible deniability , but the post suggests that such messages occurred prior to all or most games , such that the school either knew of it or was willfully blind to it .If the cheerleaders were not cheerleaders but merely fans in the stand chanting about Jesus or Allah or Buddha , there might be an argument that the speech was not explicitly or implicitly endorsed by the school .But allowing school - sanctioned cheerleaders to display religious banners at school - sanctioned games through which the school - sanctioned team runs before every game has a strong whiff of Establishment Clause violation , even to someone who might be familiar with the school 's policies .A school would not be allowed to have a priest or rabbi or imam come in to the school every week and then act surprised and claim freedom of speech if it just happened that the guest spoke about religion every time .NPR4U .There is no concern that schools might skirt the Establishment Clause by proxy or ignorance because if the School has a purpose of advancing religion the court will make that determination , e.g. Santa Fe .And yes , the standard does consider non - passersby , but they need only be reasonably informed .Moreover , the state has explicitly opened the forum for private speech , such as this .Any person aware of those simple facts would clearly see that the speech is private .The fact that the school permits it does not mean that it endorses it , but merely that it refuses to discriminate against private religious speech , particularly positive speech intended to encourage and build people up .The Supreme Court is like everybody else , it 's imperfect -- and so are we .Maybe they 're right and we 're wrong .But we are going to have these differences .So let me tell you what I think the law is today and what I have instructed the Department of Education and the Department of Justice to do about it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.53453"}

Meiners .8th Grade , Caledonia Middle School .If I had the chance to personally talk to America 's Founding Fathers , I would most likely start by thanking them .John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , George Washington , Thomas Payne , Richard Henry Lee , Thomas Jefferson , Roger Sherman , James Wilson and Alexander Hamilton were some of the amazing men that helped found our country .Because of them we have many freedoms we would not have had without their initiative .I , as a citizen of this wonderful country , am so happy I can voice my opinions , choose my religion and vote for who I want to represent my country without being punished .After showing my appreciation , I would start talking about technology and how much it has improved .Cell phones , iPods , iPads , laptops , computers and radios are some of these technological advances .Most of these are portable devices that are used for calling playing music and games and even searching the internet .Because they most likely wo n't know what the internet is I would describe it as many different forms of networks that are there to serve society .Other forms of improved technology are in the medical field and agriculture .In the medical field , doctors are now able to scan any part of the body and perform surgeries daily .As an example , open heart surgery has become much less life threatening because of technology .An example of agriculture is irrigation .With the flick of a switch , or sensors , fields can be watered .I do wonder what their response to this information would be .Next , I would tell my founding fathers about Earth and what America 's land now looks like .I would tell them how skyscrapers , tall buildings and large bridges are so common .I would tell them about how massive they are and how small we are compared to them .Another thing I would tell the Fathers about landscape is how we have set aside land in parks so no one can ruin the natural beauty .Finally , I would sum it all up by again telling them how much I personally appreciate what they did for our country .I could n't even imagine what life would be like if Britain controlled our country .Because I have the freedoms I have from the Founding Fathers I can live my life freely and thoroughly .So as I said before , thank you , men .Grand Jury Clause - 5th Amendment .The Grand Jury Clause is the first clause in the 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution .It guarantees that all people have the right to be indicted by a Grand Jury before they are charged with a federal crime that is considered to be \" infamous . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.738434"}

{"text": "The state in Sherbert could not demonstrate such compelling interest : the mere possibility that allowing exemptions to the unemployment compensation laws for Saturday worshipers might result in fraudulent or spurious claims was not sufficiently compelling , the Court reasoned .After Sherbert and Yoder , the Court applied the religious - exemption doctrine by examining two questions : Has the government significantly burdened a sincerely motivated religious practice ?If so , is the burden justified by a compelling state interest ?The Smith revolution .It was clear that the Supreme Court was struggling with the issue of requiring accommodations based on the compelling - interest standard .In Smith , two counselors were fired from their jobs with a private drug rehabilitation organization because they ingested peyote at a ceremony of the Native American Church .The U.S. Supreme Court held that the free - exercise clause permits the state to prohibit sacramental peyote use and the state can thus deny unemployment benefits to persons discharged for such use .Justice Antonin Scalia , writing for the majority , declined to apply the balancing test of Sherbert v. Verner , greatly limiting the scope of that precedent .Scalia found that the Court had never in fact invalidated any government action on the basis of the Sherbert compelling - interest test except the denial of unemployment compensation ( that Smith was itself an unemployment compensation case is not addressed in the decision ) .Post-Smith implications .In the three years following Smith , more than 50 reported free - exercise cases were decided against religious groups and individuals .The act , which was signed by President Clinton on Nov. 17 , 1993 , restored the compelling - interest test and ensured its application in all cases where religious exercise is substantially burdened .Also in 1993 , the Supreme Court re - visited the religious exemption issue in City of Hialeah .The Supreme Court found that the history of the ordinance showed that it specifically targeted the Santeria practice of animal sacrifice while providing numerous exemptions for other instances of animal slaughter , including Kosher slaughter .The ordinances could not withstand such scrutiny , the Court stated , holding them invalid under the free - exercise clause .Similarly , a claimant may prevail if he can prove that a law of general applicability that burdens religion is unevenly enforced ( see Rader v. Johnston ) .However , some lower courts have interpreted City of Hialeah to mean that religious claimants must demonstrate an anti - religious motive when challenging a law that on its face is generally applicable , a difficult standard to prove .While widely supported , RFRA was short - lived .On June 25 , 1997 , the Supreme Court , by a vote of 6 - 3 , struck down the act as applied to state and local governments .The Court in City of Boerne v. Flores held that Congress overstepped its bounds by forcing states to provide more protection for religious liberty than the First Amendment , as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Employment Division v.

{"text": "The colonists had gone through a period of being denied the right to trial by jury under the British Crown .Due to high taxation and trade laws , colonists were heavily engaged in smuggling .Officials began to try and convict more and more colonists for their smuggling operations , but colonial juries frequently acquitted the accused smugglers , even if they blatantly violated the law .This caused the King to set up new courts without juries , so they could not undermine the convictions .This gave an enormous amount of power to judges who often had personal motives to convict the accused , such as earning a percentage of the judgement against them , or to earn favor and promotion in the eyes of the crown .The Founding Fathers saw trial by jury as a defense against just such corrupt government officials .In a trial by jury , a group of the accused 's own peers would make the determination of guilt or innocence , rather than one individual in the employment of the government .The accused 's neighbors and peers are likely to have similar interests and beliefs as the accused person .The possibility for corruption is much less likely with a jury trial than if the decision lies in the hands of a single judge , who may have personal motives against the accused or an agenda he wishes to promote .Learn more about the history , meaning and purpose of the 7th Amendment here .8th Amendment .The 8th Amendment to the Constitution protects three rights for all Americans .It requires that : .Excessive bail shall not be required .Excessive fines shall not be imposed .Cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted .The Excessive Bail Clause .Bail is paid by an accused defendant in order to get out of jail before the date of his trial .If the defendant shows up for his trial , the bail money is returned to him , but if he fails to show up for his trial , he forfeits the money .Bail must be set sufficiently high that the accused person has an incentive to show up for trial so he does not lose his money , but it can not be set so high that it is an unreasonable amount .This was important to the Founding Fathers due to instances in British history when judges required such high bail that there was no way accused people could pay it .Judges often did this to punish people with different political beliefs than their own .The Excessive Fines Clause .The Courts will not allow fines that are grossly disproportional to the seriousness of the offense .Even so , higher courts rarely overturn the decision of a lower court where fines are concerned .This is one of the least used provisions of the Bill of Rights .In fact , the Supreme Court never overturned a case for violating the Excessive Fines Clause until 1998 .The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause .Great Britain had a long and terrible history of cruel and unusual punishments inflicted on convicted criminals , things such as burning at the stake , chopping off body parts , crucifixion , castration , breaking on the wheel and so on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.538445"}

{"text": "In other words , it leaves us without a meaningful pluralism .Consensus liberalism is objectionable from at least four distinct strands of political theory : contemporary liberalism , communitarianism , classical liberalism ( and its contemporary libertarian successors ) , and radical democracy .Contemporary liberalism ( or at least some versions ) objects to consensus liberalism 's privileging of certain liberal values over others .Since the work of Isaiah Berlin , contemporary liberalism has recognized the necessity of balancing a plurality of values - one value can not uniformly trump others .Communitarianism , which emerged during the 1980s and 1990s in response to some of the claims of Rawlsian liberalism , objects to the idea that the equality upon which consensus liberalism depends can be given a coherent meaning apart from the practices of a particular community . \"Liberal equality \" begs the question of \" whose equality , which liberalism . \"Classical liberalism objects to consensus liberalism 's push to eliminate the private sphere .Much of the theoretical work traces back to John Locke 's divide between public and private .Locke has become the patron saint of one of the modern heirs to classical liberalism , libertarianism .For example , Robert Nozick 's Anarchy , State , and Utopia employs Lockean arguments against Rawls 's theory of justice .Similar libertarian arguments have also been raised in the specific context of the boundaries of group autonomy .An absolute libertarianism is implausible today .Employment discrimination , public accommodation , and other laws that emerged out of the civil rights era routinely curtail the autonomy of commercial enterprises , and few people object to these restrictions .For this reason , most recent libertarian arguments defend the autonomy of \" noncommercial \" groups rather than private groups more generally .Andrew Koppelman has called these arguments neolibertarian .According to Koppelman , neolibertarian arguments are \" only slightly modified versions of old , discredited libertarian objections .\" Koppelman links neolibertarian arguments not only to segregrationist objections to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but also to rampant racism following the Civil War that led private businesses to refuse to serve African Americans .His objection to the neolibertarian position is politically salient and intellectually rigorous .It ties some arguments for greater group autonomy to a virulent racism that most people - including most of those who fall under Koppelman 's neolibertarian label - condemn as reprehensible .But Koppelman 's historical and normative argument falls short in one important respect : it leaves unaddressed the competing narrative of the protections our country has long granted to groups that dissent from majoritarian control .Like \" the idea of a legal prohibition against discrimination , \" the legal recognition of the importance of group autonomy \" is as old as the United States . \"The latter , in fact , long precedes the founding , having taken root in the political practices of William Penn and Roger Williams , who between them founded four of the original thirteen colonies .As Richard Hofstadter has noted : .Madisonian pluralism owes a great deal to the example of religious toleration and religious liberty that had already been established in eighteenth - century America .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.70683"}

{"text": "However the term \" press \" has a wider meaning , it encompasses the printing press and also applies to any form of publishing establishment .A free press is required for the printing of religious texts .Restriction of the press has been used to restrict the freedom of religion , and the framers of the Bill of Rights would certainly have been aware of this .For example : .In 16th century England the Tyndale Bible , the first mass produced English translation of the Bible , was banned .Tyndale was arrested by church authorities , tried for heresy , strangled and burnt at the stake .In 1668 , after writing The Sandy Foundation Shaken ( a text espousing his Quaker views )William Penn was charged for publication without a license and imprisoned in the Tower of London .Congress shall make no law abridging the right of the people peaceably to assemble .Nowadays , when we think about the right to assemble , we normally think of political assembly and in particular the right to protest .But we should n't forget that the practice of most religions involves peaceful assembly .Religious persecution has often been carried out by breaking up religious meetings , prosecuting those involved in said meeting , or banning such meetings .For example : .In 1662 John Browne was arrested was arrested on orders of Peter Stuyvesant , Director - General of the colony of New Netherland ( now New York ) for allowing a Quaker meeting in his house .In England the Conventicle Act of 1664 forbade religious assemblies of more than five people outside the Church of England .In 1670 William Penn was arrested , accused of preaching before a gathering in the street .Penn had deliberately provoked the authorities in this way to test the validity of the then new law against assembly .Congress shall make no law abridging the right to petition the Government for a redress of grievances .What 's this about then ?It seems almost unrelated to the other clauses .In December 1657 by a group of citizens from the town of Flushing ( now part of Queens , New York ) petitioned Peter Stuyvesant , protesting against his persecution of Quakers .None of the 30 signatories of the petition were Quakers themselves .This petition became known as the Flushing Remonstrance .Stuyvesant arrested those who presented the document to him , and forced the signatories to recant .Edward Hart , the town clerk , and Tobias Feake , sheriff of Flushing , refused to recant , and spent over a month in prison .Nowadays we tend to think about the right to petition as a means of achieving political aims and as a means of protecting public participation in government , however petitions have historically been used to protest against religious persecution .In summary .Every single clause of the First Amendment protects religious liberty .Removal of any of these clauses would open the door to a form of religious persecution .Do n't forget our evolving Constitution .Share : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.198265"}
