'Wenner , who now owns homes in New York and the Hamptons , as well as a private jet , is one of the last independent publishers .Wenner Media owns not only Rolling Stone but also Men 's Journal and Us Weekly , a popular , celebrity - led tabloid that makes more money than his original creation .The value of Wenner Media as a whole is thought to be somewhere between $ 600 m and $ 900 m .Eleven years ago , he left his wife and business partner - the person from whom he 'd borrowed that seminal $ 7,500 - and their three sons for Matt Nye , a male fashion designer in his twenties .The tabloids devoured him ; last month , syndicated gossip columnist Liz Smith announced that Wenner and Nye were expecting a baby - without adding any further explanatory detail .Wenner has become been the victim as well as the victor in his own star - making system .In an introduction to a collection of Rolling Stone interviews published in 1971 , Wenner offered something like a mission statement . 'Rolling Stone , ' he wrote , ' was founded and continues to operate in the belief that rock'n'roll music is the energy centre for all sorts of changes evolving rapidly around us : social , political , cultural , however you want to describe them .a real America : funky , violent , deeply divided , despairing , exultant , rooted in rich historical tradition and ethnic variety . 'He thought , in other words , that rock'n'roll was politics , and everything else besides , and he even asserted that the great minds of his generation were writing rock music , not novels or operas .Yet this focus on music led Wenner to miss all kinds of other things that were emblematic of that generation too .Women 's lib , for instance , passed him by - he would n't let women attend editorial meetings until staff members staged a sit - in .And he felt no compunction about declaring after the assassination of Martin Luther King that King 's death ' meant little or nothing to the majority of the American people ' .These two things , which seemed so entwined at the time , forked drastically afterwards .Sixties politics collapsed even as Sixties culture triumphed .It was preserving the life of that culture , not its politics , that , as Wilentz has it , ' the magazine in fact helped change America ' .When I ask what he means , he goes on : ' It 's astonishing to me that I can walk across campus now and hear the Grateful Dead coming through the windows .When I was a kid we did n't listen to Frank Sinatra .The music of my generation has become a national music , along with country and western , and the magazine had a huge part in that .

'No matter how liberal the magazine has been traditionally , it 's probable that the Bush administration has allowed Rolling Stone to take up a cultural position far more similar to that of its origins than it has had in decades .Weir pointed out that politics began to fall by the wayside at the magazine early , as the Vietnam War came to a close .If that 's the case , then the war in Iraq may well have galvanised its comeback .Rolling Stone 's circulation is up to 1.5 million now ; before the war , it was 250,000 less than that .In an interview with the New York Times last December , Wenner , who was then about to turn 60 , explained that covering culture was what kept the magazine young . 'We have evolved and transitioned well with a lot of cultural changes , ' he said .Indeed , while the magazine 's post - Summer of Love origins are now the stuff of myth , its survival up to the present day has been built on a series of chameleonlike changes with the times .Set up in San Francisco in 1967 with $ 7,500 borrowed from Wenner 's wife 's family , Rolling Stone fostered some of the greatest journalistic minds of the 20th century .The magazine covered Nixon 's election campaign in 1972 , the Manson murders , the kidnapping of Patty Hearst , the whistle blown by Karen Silkwood .Articles of 20,000 words were routine .Then something happened .The magazine 's staff became more famous than its subjects .Hunter Thompson could n't cover stories for fear of being mobbed by autograph hunters .Wenner moved headquarters to New York and began escorting Jackie O around town .He appeared in a movie with John Travolta .It was a novel about the Eighties , and about money , written by a man who is still vociferously Republican .Of course , it was a great publishing coup , but it was also emblematic of a new political stance .In 1990 , the magazine was dubbed ' The Wall Street Journal of rock'n'roll ' .For music fans , Rolling Stone made its reputation in the late Sixties and early Seventies supporting classic rock acts such as John Lennon and Bob Dylan , but it was slow to champion new movements .In the mid - Seventies , Wenner was reluctant to cover punk , preferring middle - of - the - road acts such as The Eagles and Fleetwood Mac at the expense of the magazine 's credibility .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.57185"}

'Jann Wenner is an infamously eternal wunderkind - a cross between Hugh Hefner , Jack Black and Peter Pan .Stories of his excesses - of generosity , cruelty and wit - are legion .He would pay huge hospital bills , unprompted , yet fire long - standing staff members without batting an eyelid .In the old days , if a writer was having trouble meeting a deadline , he would breeze past with the words , ' time for your medication ! ' and administer a dose of speed .Everybody , that is , except Jann himself .His petulant fits and rages actually seemed frozen at an age considerably south of 16 - think \" terrible two \" and you 'll get the idea . 'The son of a man Newsweek once described as ' a dark and stocky Walter Mitty ' who became a baby food impresario , Wenner was sent to boarding school so that his parents could get divorced in his absence .What followed , he liked to half - joke , was a custody battle over him : neither parent wanted to keep him .Wenner 's ensuing insecurities ( he could never speak to you , one colleague reported , without covering half his face ) provided both his flair and his downfall .As part of a generation that felt betrayed by its parents , Wenner the editor could , as Weir put it , ' really trust his wounded instincts as he proceeded to capture the Zeitgeist of the age ' .Yet as soon as one of his writers became too strong , he let them fall away .
