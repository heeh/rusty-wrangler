'A Manchester Airport spokesman said : ' Two female passengers who were booked to fly out of Terminal Two refused to be scanned for medical and religious reasons .In accordance with the government directive on scanners , they were not permitted to fly .Body scanning is a big change for customers and we are aware that privacy concerns are on our customers 's minds , which is why we have put strict procedures in place to reassure them that their privacy will be protected .

'In the U.S. , there are now 40 scanners in 19 airports and could be as many as 450 by the end of the year .The powerful council of ten scholars that issued the fatwa is affiliated with the Islamic Society of North America .Social Question .A Muslim woman refuse body scan , should they get a pass or be denied boarding the flight ?A Muslim woman was barred from boarding a flight after she refused to undergo a full body scan for religious reasons and her companion another Muslim woman cited medical reasons .They both forfeited their tickets .Should there be exceptions of body scans for these religious or medical reasons and given a pass ?Does their Muslim background make this any more of an issue ?Being Muslim should n't have anything to do with it .Anyone who refuses a scan should be prevented from boarding if those are the rules .I assume that there is an alternative option for those with medical exceptions - were they offered that as an alternative ?While I am usually in favor of the freedom to practice one 's religion , I think the only effective way to uitilize full body scans as a security measure is if anyone requested to has to do it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.978226"}

{"text": "For instance while Muslims in Islamic countries favored Sharia , they differed in its interpretations they want it applicable in select areas , Property Rights , Divorce , . 'The percentage of Muslims who say they want sharia to be \" the official law of the land \" varies widely around the world , from fewer than one - in - ten in Azerbaijan ( 8 % ) to near unanimity in Afghanistan ( 99 % ) .Jihad No , . 'Around the world , most Muslims also reject suicide bombing and other attacks against civilians .However , substantial minorities in several countries say such acts of violence are at least sometimes justified , including 26 % of Muslims in Bangladesh , 29 % in Egypt , 39 % in Afghanistan and 40 % in the Palestinian territories . 'At the same time , the survey finds that even in many countries where there is strong backing for sharia , most Muslims favor religious freedom for people of other faiths .In Pakistan , for example , three - quarters of Muslims say that non - Muslims are very free to practice their religion , and fully 96 % of those who share this assessment say it is \" a good thing .\" Yet 84 % of Pakistani Muslims favor enshrining sharia as official law .These seemingly divergent views are possible partly because most supporters of sharia in Pakistan - as in many other countries - think Islamic law should apply only to Muslims .Moreover , Muslims around the globe have differing understandings of what sharia means in practice . '\" In most countries surveyed , majorities of Muslim women as well as men agree that a wife is always obliged to obey her husband .Indeed , more than nine - in - ten Muslims in Iraq ( 92 % ) , Morocco ( 92 % ) , Tunisia ( 93 % ) , Indonesia ( 93 % ) , Afghanistan ( 94 % ) and Malaysia ( 96 % ) express this view .At the same time , majorities in many countries surveyed say a woman should be able to decide for herself whether to wear a veil . \"Conflict between Science , Religion and Modern Society . \"Overall , the survey finds that most Muslims see no inherent tension between being religiously devout and living in a modern society .Nor do they see any conflict between religion and science .Many favor democracy over authoritarian rule , believe that humans and other living things have evolved over time and say they personally enjoy Western movies , music and television - even though most think Western popular culture undermines public morality ' . 'The new survey also allows some comparisons with prior Pew Research Center surveys of Muslims in the United States .Like most Muslims worldwide , U.S. Muslims generally express strong commitment to their faith and tend not to see an inherent conflict between being devout and living in a modern society .But American Muslims are much more likely than Muslims in other countries to have close friends who do not share their faith , and they are much more open to the idea that many religions - not only Islam - can lead to eternal life in heaven .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.40279"}
