I find it hard to believe that he made no profit from what was auctioned , even if he only uses it as a tax write off , he s still benefiting from it .NOT ONCE did the owner of the company EVER mention to us about the auction company retrieving our items .It was nt until WE investigated and had found out what happened through other parties again other parties meaning NOT the owner of the company that was actually responsible for our belongings .And NOT ONCE did this owner apologize or recognize any wrongdoing , this is the same person who is saying that I am adding more lies and falsehoods .If you notice , in the beginning the owner denies knowing anything about what happened to our belongings and now all of a sudden he s finally admitting the truth but still accusing us of making false statements .So who is the liar ? ?When you go back and read this entire report through this website and several others , you ll notice that our facts have remained the same , his story keeps changing .He s stated that in 20 + years of business , he s never had any reports filed against him until now .The BBB shows something different .The owner keeps stating that he has nothing to hide and was cooperative with the police and the insurance agencies only he failed to inform them that our belongings were sold at auction .So if he had nothing to hide then why has it taken almost a year for him to mention the fact that the auction company took our belongings ?I can only imagine that Terry would be sticking to his I do nt know what happened story if WE had nt brought out the truth .Unfortunately , I was nt able to bring charges against him , but Ill be damned if I sit by and do nothing after what he did .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.08914"}

{"text": "If you were raised in an argumentative household , it may feel natural to argue a lot .Maybe you get a buzz from the excitement that arguing brings .But whatever the cause , chronic arguing brings problems - and not just for the neighbours .Sure , most of us argue sometimes and it would be a boring world if we all saw things in exactly the same way .But destructive arguing can destroy valuable relationships .The opposite of arguing is n't agreement in all things , it 's knowing how to disagree and still maintain mutual respect and liking .Here are seven tips to help you stop arguing . 1 ) You stop arguing !Take responsibility .It takes two to argue .Instead of thinking : \" Well , they started it ! \" , look to yourself : \" Okay , they are trying to argue but I am not going to .\" If you deny fire oxygen , it wo n't burn .Instead , recognize areas where you can agree and focus on those .People will feel more connected to you and willing to cooperate when you can make at least some ' agreement statements ' such as : .\" I can see why you would think that ... \" or : .\" I realize what you are saying ... \" .Ask questions and listen to the answers . 2 ) Stop arguing by binning the insults .The famous psychologist John Gottman ( 1 ) discovered that the way a couple argue is a big predictor of whether they 'll break up .If their tiffs contain criticism ( rather than complaint ) then the relationship is headed toward meltdown .Character assassination is a huge no - no when it comes to keeping friends and lovers .When you criticize , you over - generalize negatively about their whole identity .So if someone forgets to pick up some milk , \" You are such a lazy slob ! \" would be a criticism because it attacks their whole character .\" I 'm upset you forget the milk ! \" is a reasonable complaint because it 's specific .Avoid criticizing rather than complaining and remember to let people know when they make you happy , too .3 ) Stop trying to convince people by arguing .You might be right , but arguing is n't a great way to convince people .Why ?Because if they 're defensive and angry , they 'll be unable to hear you .People are like radio transmitters when it comes to communication .They are either set to ' receive ' or ' transmit ' .Arguing is akin to all participants being stuck on ' transmit ' .This is known technically as ' a waste of time ' .Logic only penetrates when someone is calm enough to let it .Plus , people often care more about being seen to be right when they argue rather than actually being right .So just state your case once and forget it .Strong emotion swamps the thinking part of the brain ( 2 ) ; trying to convince someone whilst you or they are angry or feeling insulted wo n't work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.52515"}

{"text": "I hope something here helps you .Okay , so much for why I 've written this and how it came to be .Introduction .Three Observations .Before I mention my background I want to include three observations of SL that have helped guide me .FIRST OBSERVATION .I 've been in SL for 27 months .Yes , we can decorate ourselves beautifully , but if we never say or do anything with others , then we are simply nothing but a pretty cartoon .The moment we begin involvement with others , our reputation begins .Again , I 've been here long enough to know that your reputation is the most important thing you have .SECOND OBSERVATION .SL is nothing more than a reflection of RL .I 've listened to people argue about whether or not SL is a game .To me , it does n't matter .In every game , real or virtual , it 's a person playing or doing it .You may be able to become somebody else here as far as how you look , but given enough time and interaction with others , who you really are - your personality & character - will become evident to those around you .The real you will surface in the virtual you .Thus , your reputation will grow positive or negative .THIRD OBSERVATION .It is as hard or harder to build anything of value in SL as it is in RL .Those who are not prepared to sacrifice in every way will never be successful here ... or in RL .MY BACKGROUND .I 'll mention a bit from my SL and RL to try to explain to you what Sweet Lilly has asked of me : my experience , beliefs , and values .My beliefs and values are really what I have come to learn to be true and what I think works best ( at least for me ) in Second Life and Real Life .Some of this will also come out as what I hope for the future , as it applies to those who want to excel toward higher goals , rather than just showing up to dance or dress .I will also mention , to a great degree , my thoughts on models , modeling , and fashion , since that is really what I know best .REAL LIFE Please , please , do n't think I 'm telling you my RL background , because I think I have it all going on or to brag .I 'm telling you this , because it has everything to do with how my beliefs and values have been shaped .Actually , I run a risk by mentioning my background .I risk the possibility of people guessing my identity and that 's a problem for me .It 's a problem , because I have very little private life in RL , and I love SL , because I can come here and hide .I can play .I can have friends based on nothing other than we like one another , and you have no idea how much I enjoy and need that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.64517"}
{"text": "In fact , you may be willing to pay a little more to hire quality movers who can ensure the safety of your belongings .Do n't be afraid to call these companies and ask questions .Questions to Ask Movers Before Hiring Them .During the hiring process , you want to make sure of three things : First , that the moving company is reputable and has the proper licensing and insurance .Second , that the movers are dependable , professional and committed to doing the job correctly .Finally , that the estimate provided is binding and that you 're aware of any potential excess costs .With these factors in mind , here are some of the most important questions to ask a moving company : .How long have you been in business ?Are you licensed and insured ?Can you provide letters of recommendation ?How do your movers safely transport furniture without damaging it ?What are the next steps in the event that something is lost or damaged in transit ?Is the quote binding or nonbinding ?Can you offer a binding estimate ?Are there any extra costs , fees or fines I should be aware of ?Do you require a deposit ?How to Avoid Scams .As with any service profession , there are certain moving companies - though they are few and far between - that are n't reputable or that will try to take advantage of you .It 's important to be able to recognize a scam if you come across one .Call the FMCSA For long - distance or interstate moves , you can easily check that companies have the proper licensing and insurance , which is a clear indication that they 're legitimate .All interstate moving companies must be registered with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration , so call 888 - 368 - 7238 to confirm the licenses , insurance and credentials of the movers you 're considering .The FMCSA can also tell you if any complaints have been filed against a particular moving company .Check with the American Moving and Storage Association For both local and long - distance moving companies , AMSA is another good place to check out a company 's legitimacy .Moving companies are n't required to be an AMSA member , but the ones that are have committed to the association 's rules and regulations , which protect both the companies and the consumers hiring them .If a company is n't an AMSA member , that does n't mean it is n't reputable , but an AMSA membership is a clear indication of legitimacy .Damage Prevention Tips .One of the most common fears people face when moving to a new home is that something they own will be lost or damaged in the process .While no company will be able to guarantee everything arrives safely , there are steps you can take to make damage less likely .Pack and Transport Your Valuables If you have items that are emotionally or financially valuable to you , do your best to pack and move them yourself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.699875"}

{"text": "Choose a Moving Company That Plans Ahead Moving companies can better keep your belongings safe when the movers plan ahead .What does this mean ?Many companies take extra time to measure doorways , halls and stairways to find the safest route in and out of your home .They should also provide furniture blankets , covers and moving pads to keep both your home and your belongings free of scratches or other damage .Keep the Moving Area Safe There are some things you can control on moving day and some things you simply ca n't , such as the weather .If you 're moving on a snowy , icy or rainy day , keeping all of your paths , stairways and walkways clear and dry is crucial .This can help protect both the movers and the large items they 're carrying to and from the truck .Should You Tip Movers ?The subject of tipping is relatively unclear when it comes to movers .However , there is a general rule of thumb that most people in the industry agree on : Tip your movers if they 've done a good job and you think a tip is warranted .Generally , a 5 percent tip is considered appropriate , though some people recommend paying $ 20 per day , per mover for basic , local moves .However , almost everyone agrees you should first do a quick walk - through of your home to check for any damage to your furniture or belongings and to make sure everything is where you 'd like it to be .If you do decide to give a tip , divide it evenly and give money to each individual , rather than giving the entire sum to the head mover and expecting it to be doled out equally .One type of tip to avoid : alcohol .It 's usually illegal for movers to have bottles of alcohol in the truck or van , so tipping a bottle of wine or liquor could get them into trouble .Los Angeles Senior Moving .James the foreman and his mover helpers from Hercules Moving Systems were the best movers we ever had .My mother had recently passed away in Hemet California and we needed to get Dad and all the 50 years of stuff moved to Georgia .My parents were into their eighties and they ... more were children of the depression .Over the years they had accumulated furniture and whatever else and did not get rid of anything .So on top of finding a mover we had to go threw 50 + years of accumulated stuff never hardly used and never thrown away .As we were preparing for an Estate sale this threw Dad for a loop this was hard on him .We happened to contact a mover out of Los Angeles by the name of Hercules .Mom and Dad had lived in a 55 + community for 10 years and Hercules came reccomended from the Seniors Center manager .He told me that Hercules had been moving in and out of the community for quite some time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.60306"}

Komen for the Cure .After the event was over , I contacted Bryan on Twitter and we met to discuss a partnership between our two organizations .It seemed natural to have a Catwalk event ( since that is in Bryan 's wheelhouse of expertise ) to benefit BMC 's Cancer Care Center , which is located in the Moakley building at BMC .Me : Has BMC done an event like this before ?If not , what prompted you to do the Catwalk event ?On average we execute 7 - 9 events large and small designed to benefit BMC programs .Up to this point , we have never had a cancer - specific fundraising event and given the number of cancer patients we serve and the level of complexity of the cases , we really needed to create something unique to raise awareness and funds .Me : Tell me about your goals for the event and how Open HeARTS plays into meeting those goals .Holt : BMC has a very specific role in the community and our cancer care services are no exception .We provide superb cancer care to the residents of Boston who are most at risk and least likely to receive the care that all cancer patients deserve .Because of who we serve , I would argue that no other hospital so routinely goes the extra mile to ensure that patients are getting the care they need .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.64026"}
{"text": "That feeling of being part of a design community has benefits .\" It 's really great because you can actually sit down and talk with somebody who has a sympathetic ear and understands all the little daily things we have to go through , \" Reynolds said .Aside from a few exceptions , being an Omaha fashion designer means working solo rather than with a team of assistants .It means doing everything by hand one 's self .It means working a day job to support this passion and then pulling all - nighters to get lines ready for showing .Most designers have little time to actually market their brand .Nomad 's Nick Hudson confirmed that OFW is trying to provide more structure for designers .\" We 're helping them with just simple things like business cards and Web sites - trying to help designers with some of the business basics .\" Top of the World .According to Omaha fashion professionals and observers taking the scene to the next level requires putting in place a support system that operates year - round , not just around Fashion Week .Said Nomad owner Nick Hudson , \" One of the things the designers asked us to help them with is getting in more stores .I 'd love there to be a store that stocked all the designers all the time , so that 's something we 're working on , trying to encourage more stores to stock the clothes . \"A more economically sustainable scene is the goal and that means finding ways to link more designers with buyers or investors .Designer and shop owner Buf Reynolds said Omaha lacks an infrastructure for designers .\" You do n't have somebody who can take a one - of - a - kind garment and turn it into a pattern , then send it to somebody who can do a small scale production of it .If that happened in Omaha I think that would change everything pretty drastically . \"Lindsey Baker sees a need for Fashion Week to facilitate more interaction between designers and those interested in fashion , whether consumers , store buyers , or journalists like herself .\" I 'd love for there to be a greater opportunity to mingle with the designers and say , ' I really love that dress - how can I get it ?

{"text": "Or are you on a tight budget and looking to hire a mover who can keep costs low ?Either way , it 's important to understand how exactly moving companies charge their customers .The Move As mentioned above , for local moves , companies will charge based on the number of movers they provide and the amount of time they 'll need to spend on the project .Generally , the more rooms in your apartment or house , the more movers and time you can expect to be charged for .The price of long - distance or interstate moves , on the other hand , will be based on the amount of belongings you have - and more specifically the weight of those belongings .The heavier the boxes or items you 're shipping across state or country lines , the more expensive your move will be .Moving costs will vary greatly , depending on where you are .Local moves in a small town in the Midwest will be much less expensive than comparable moves in New York City .For that reason , it 's best to do some research about the going rates in your area .The Estimate No matter what type of move you 're making , you can reach out to prospective moving companies for estimates - this is the best way to determine how expensive your move will be based on where you live and what services you 're looking for .Typically , the moving company will send someone to your home who will do a walk through of each room , making note of the furniture , valuables and other belongings in each one .Then , he or she will provide an estimate .The exact amount you pay may , however , be different from the amount declared in the estimate .That 's where the type of contract comes in .Nonbinding vs. Binding Contracts For any move , a company will ask you to sign a contract .It 's crucial to know exactly what type of contract you 're signing , though , to understand how much you can expect to pay .In basic terms , there are two types of moving contracts : binding and nonbinding .Binding , as well as binding not - to - exceed , contracts are the most preferable for people hiring movers .These list an estimated price the moving company can not charge more than .So , even if your local move takes an hour longer or your belongings are heavier than expected for an interstate move , you 're still only responsible for paying a fixed amount .Nonbinding contracts , on the other hand , have no fixed final number .Instead , they list a rate - by the hour or by the pound / kilo - and you 're responsible for paying exactly how much your move costs in those terms .Extra Costs Keep in mind that movers provide a variety of services , many of which you may not require .These can affect how expensive your move will be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.87311"}
