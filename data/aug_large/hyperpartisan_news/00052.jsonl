{"text": "I will be fined by the league , \" Briggs wrote . \" Reebok great job on these gloves and shoes . . .looks like I 'm getting fined this week .Lol !By far the best fine I will ever have to pay .Thanks \" .Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union - Tribune reports that several San Diego Chargers received the apparel , which one unnamed Charger plans to wear against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday and expects to be fined $ 5,000 for doing so .Earlier Thursday afternoon , Tennessee Titans quarterback Matt Hasselbeck tweeted a couple of pictures of the cleats he plans to wear on Sunday .If you thought that something as innocuous as putting up 3,000 American flags on school grounds to pay tribute to those murdered on September 11 could n't be controversial , you have n't been to Marietta College .Administrators at this liberal arts college in southeast Ohio are threatening to cancel a 9/11 memorial planned by their students if flags from other countries are not observed in the activities as well .\" I was taken aback by this decision , \" said Sarah Snow , an Alabama native and junior at Marietta .\" Our school should help students put on events , not set up obstacles , especially when we 're trying to honor those fallen .It all started when Snow , the president of the Marietta College Republicans , approached her Student Life department to get approval to participate in the 9/11 Never Forget Project .In addition to organizing a candlelight vigil , Snow sought to plant 3,000 American flags around campus starting this Sunday morning .She received approval from the Office of Student Life on June 23 , more than two months ago .But when she returned to campus for the fall semester , days before the memorial was to begin , the vice president of Student Life , Robert Pastoor , vowed to terminate the tribute unless foreign flags were mixed together with American ones .He [ Robert Pastoor ] insisted we add the international flags for the reason that it was a ' global perspective ' school , \" Snow told HUMAN EVENTS in explaining Pastoor 's basis for interfering with the College Republicans ' memorial .He continued , she noted , by saying , \" Other nationalities were killed in the twin towers as well \" and that Marietta must \" consider how the Muslim and Chinese students will feel about the [ American flag ] display .The Bears - Packers NFC Championship was supposed to be this city 's \" biggest game ever .\" For three quarters , it was looking more like \" biggest loser .\" Then , third - string quarterback Caleb Hanie replaced Todd Collins , who replaced the injured Jay Cutler , and ignited the Bears in a riveting fourth quarter .After a slip on the turf on the opening kickoff , the Packers found their traction quickly .Quarterback Aaron Rodgers hit Greg Jennings on consecutive plays for 21- and 26-yard gains .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.992195"}

{"text": "Religious beliefs ( Jehova 's Witnesses ) , not being a US Citizen ( contrary to what many think , it is possible to be a legal immigrant without being a U.S. Citizen ) , and many others .That said , the law is very clear .Students shall not be required to recite the pledge .Students shall not be punished for exercising this right .Students shall not be embarrassed by the teacher or harassed by others for exercising this right .That includes quietly sitting down while other people stand , as she was not being disruptive .What part of that is so hard to understand ?It is a RIGHT of the student to choose to participate or not participate .It is a right that no teacher , parent , principal , or police officer can take away , as it is guaranteed by the United States Constitution .I would never skip the pledge or refuse to stand for the National Anthem .But I choose to say the pledge , and it has a lot more meaning when I choose to do it as opposed to being forced to do it .I 'm not naive enough to believe that other people may feel differently , and I firmly believe that they have a right to opt - out .This girl clearly did , this girl was more aware of her rights than the teacher , and this girl exercised those rights .If you do n't like it , than change the rules .But in order to do that , you will likely have to get a Constitutional Amendment passed .Best of luck with that .I currently teach in a Maryland middle school after 10 years in high school .This issue has come up in my room several times in the past .In middle school , I explain to the students at the beginning of the year that they DO have the right to not say the PLEDGE .We discuss the topic openly from both sides and I have yet to find a student who feels the desire to refuse .In high school , I did the same and in only a few situations did a student refuse .I would honor their request if they wrote a short essay explaining their reasons for not saying the Pledge .You see , most of the students who \" refuse \" the Pledge are doing so not for political or religious beliefs , but rather to bring attention to themselves - to rebell .After asking a simple request for an honest essay to explain to me their reasons almost always ended up with the student standing for the Pledge the next day .This issue can become a very in depth , teachable moment , and I am pretty certain has become a topic in many Social Studies classes throughout the states .Our students need to understand WHAT their rights are as well as WHY they have these rights and HOW these rights are protected .This should not be made into a circus .People have to prove they 're patriotic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.008286"}

{"text": "I 'm quite sure that every nation which provides publicly funded schools has the pupils participate in ( or be respectful of ) a national anthem or pledge .Here in America it 's tthe Star Spangled Banner and the Pledge of Alligiance .I 'm sure you stand at the ballgames and maybe even cheer at the conclusion .Two weeks ago a family I 've mentored for the past eight years became citizens of the USA .You can bet they and their children , all public school students , are THRILLED to actually RECITE the Pledge of Alligiance , as well as be tremendously respectful !@PJ : I 'm calling shenanigans on the class - baiting .This culture war crap can become an issue in any community , in large part because it goes to deeply - held values on both sides of the issue .And I fail to see why opposition to the Pledge should require one to leave public schools - or , in Chris @20 's case , the country ( and yes , Chris - that was ' love it or leave it ' despite your denials ) .Neither you nor Chris have been able to rationally explain why this should be so .Actually I spent my entire school and university career in publicly - funded institutions in the UK and have taught in publicly funded schools in France and never once had to sing the national anthem or recite a pledge ( neither country even has a pledge of allegiance ) .That sort of forced patriotism is very uncommon outside of the US in my experience .Though it would have been amusing to see the children of American expats ( of which there are many in London ) being obliged to pledge allegiance to the British Crown .As I said earlier , I would rather that my child not have to say the pledge .However , got to point at to lubilu that while pledging to the British crown may not have been commonplace in the UK , my husband is British and he had to say the Lord 's Prayer every day even though he attended public funding schools .@Wallyhood - So you teach your kids to only follow which laws they deem proper ?What if I were a professional driver and had a flawless record , can I drive 45 in a 30 mph zone ?Laws are made by the people for the people .I teach my children to follow the law and encourage them to instead debate and try to change the ones they feel are unjust .It 's funny how with all the debate , we all know this LAW will not be changed .Righteous people can take to the web yet ca n't make it to vote .Maybe if there was a mini game in FarmVille that let you cast a ballot we 'd get more participation in the process .Go 99 % !And where did I ever say that I agreed that religion should be taught in schools ?@Neighbor : \" Righteous people can take to the web yet ca n't make it to vote \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.82674"}

{"text": "Increasingly it seems that parents are failing to instill values of work ethics , respect and responsibility in their own children and expect schools to take up the slack .But they 're mighty quick to send their kids to fight adult battles , even enlisting lawyers and the ACLU if they disagree with the lessons . ...But what really bothers me is the belief so many hold that it 's OK for a 13 year old child to openly defy a teacher and snub her nose at the Pledge while attending free public school in the United States of America .Oddly , the belief came not from the parents but from the schools written policies articulated in the student handbook , from state law , and from the Supreme Court of the United States .As noted in the story referenced in the OP : . \"The Montgomery school system 's student handbook contains a section about \" Patriotic Exercises \" that reads : \" You can not be required to say a pledge , sing an anthem , or take part in patriotic exercises .No one will be permitted to intentionally embarrass you if you choose not to participate .\" The incident began on a Wednesday in late January , when the girl did not stand for the pledge .Her teacher yelled at her , demanded that she stand and then sent her to the office for her defiance , Quereshi said .The school system confirmed the sequence of events .The next morning , the girl again refused to stand for the pledge .This time , the teacher called two school police officers to the classroom to escort the girl to the office .\" How can you interpret the teacher 's action as anything except a direct violation of this policy ?What I do not understand is why the teacher was not formally warned following the incident on the first day with a reminder that the girl was acting appropriately and that he was not .If he was warned , but called security the following day anyway , he should have been suspended immediately .If he was not warned after the first incident , then the administrators in the school failed in their responsibilities .The issue has nothing to do with whether we agree with the girl 's choice ; the law and the policy make it her choice , not ours .Given that , the teacher 's behavior was a gross , repeated violation of school policy and the law .maybe i 'm missing part of the story but i do n't see where he made her follow in the pledge and no where did he intentionally embarrass her ?Making her leave the classroom because she did n't want to participate in something does n't embarrass her if anything it makes accommodations for her that I BELIEVE she should n't have in the first place .you are in this country in a government run school .The LEAST you can do is say the pledge of allegiance .maybe i 'm missing part of the story but i do n't see where he made her follow in the pledge and no where did he intentionally embarrass her ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.86293"}

{"text": "Appearing on Friday 's PFT Live on NBC Sports Radio and NBCSN , Greene suggested that , because he spent the bulk of his career with the Los Angeles Rams , he may have gotten lost in the cracks .Greene , one of the first players to change teams via true free agency , spent three seasons with the Steelers after eight in L.A. Then came a year in Carolina , a year with the 49ers , and two more with the Panthers .( Greene called his time in San Francisco a \" fart in the wind , \" which also accurately describes Jim Tomsula 's lone year as head coach - in multiple ways . )Ultimately , it was PFT 's Darin Gantt ( who holds the Carolina vote for the Hall of Fame ) task to make the case for Greene , and this year Greene got in .So as many wring hands ( rightfully so ) for the omission of Terrell Owens , it 's time for a deep exhale on Greene - and not simply because of an effort to avoid inhaling the odors of a fart in the wind .Panthers defensive end Kony Ealy is having more problems with dogs in Charlotte than he was Broncos in Santa Clara last week .According to Michael Gordon of the Charlotte Observer , Ealy was named in a lawsuit which claims he bilked sports bar owner Kris Johnson out of $ 3,000 when a dog - breeding plan fell through .The lawsuit says Ealy and his brother Danny \" Dogman \" Jones lured him into a plan to breed African Boerboel puppies .The dogs can grow to more than 200 pounds , and the lawsuit said Ealy and his brother told Johnson they needed $ 6,000 for a breeding female , promising they could make $ 35,000 a litter and $ 1 million a year .( It sounds like they might have neglected the sheer amount of chow it takes to feed a bunch of 200-pound dogs when formulating this business plan . )( Proceed . )Johnson wrote a check for $ 3,000 , but then the operation never came together for whatever reason , so he 's suing to get his money back .Ealy could not be reached for comment , but attorney Kenneth Raynor said Ealy and his brother : \" dispute the allegations , . . .and I plan on vigorously defending the lawsuit .\" The second - year defensive end had three sacks and an interception in the Super Bowl , raising his profile a bit , and making him a more visible target .The United States is n't the only country where the Super Bowl is a huge television draw .According to John Kryk of the Toronto Sun , 18 million Canadians watched at least part of Super Bowl 50 .That represents 52 percent of the Canadian population - the same percentage of Americans who watched at least part of Super Bowl 50 .Last year , Super Bowl XIL was actually watched by a slightly higher percentage of the Canadian population than of the American population .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.246994"}

{"text": "Pledge .The Seattle Times ran a story earlier this week about a good old fashioned hullaballoo at the John Stanford School : incoming principal Jesely Alvarez announced that students would be asked to recite the Pledge of Allegiance at the beginning of each school day .While it is technically state law ( and has been for decades ) that the pledge be recited , the school district has historically left it up to individual principals whether to enforce it .JSIS 's previous principle , Kelly Aramaki , declined to enforce the rule , but according to the Times article , Alvarez is changing that : .In a pair of letters sent to parents this week , Alvarez acknowledged some opposition from teachers but said that after a month of internal debate it was time \" to move forward \" in \" following state law . \"\" As adults in this school community , I believe it is important that we follow rules , \" wrote Alvarez , who declined to comment for this story .The pledge will be read over the PA system every Monday and recited in individual classrooms the other days of the week .Students who do n't want to participate will be allowed to sit or stand respectfully .In case you 've forgotten it from your childhood , the pledge reads : .I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America , and to the republic for which it stands , one nation under God , indivisible , with liberty , and justice for all .No doubt there will be some angry disagreement , but to us , the move seems weird and anachronistic , and Alvarez 's decision to begin enforcement oddly tone deaf .What good does this kind of blind recitation serve ?In our opinion , that 's a crappy position to put a child or their parent in .There are better ways to teach civics .What do you think ?I say let the kids write their own pledge of allegiance .Gets them thinking about what they really believe in .By the way , do we all know that \" under god \" was an anti - communist addition in 1954 ?Seriously , no one should take any pledge without knowing what they 're pledging and why .There 's a fine line between following rules appropriately and following them mindlessly and without discussion .I think it 's a teaching opportuniity regarding civil disobedience , the meaning of liberty and justice , the doctrine of separation of church and state , and empty platitudes .N For all of us , not just the students .I also think this principal is a wanker .Maybe I am biased because I spent nine years serving this country ( ok ...I am biased ) but I think this is a good idea because it teaches kids two things .It gives them an inkling that someone had to stand up and show their loyalty at some point by putting their life on the line for this country to give them what they have now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.35346"}

Gibran .In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks .John Muir . \" Climb the mountains and get their good tidings .Nature 's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees .The winds will blow their own freshness into you , and the storms their energy , while cares will drop off like autumn leaves . \"John Muir .To us the pledge is a form of patriotism and a means of teaching same to our children .Various minorities and radical left groups have tried to have it struck down to no avail .With what has happened over the last year or so in this country I do not expect that to happen any time soon either !I remember having to recite it in kindergarden but I do n't remember it past that .When we were in high school we got stuck listening to a bad recording of the Star Spangled banner every morning .We always plotted to switch it witht he Jimi Hendrix version but that never did come about .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.76245"}
{"text": "I encourage my daughter not to just for the sake of proving to herself and others that she does n't have to ; it 's frankly an insulting ritual unbecoming a great nation .Taking this state 's policies aside , I am not aware of many , if any , middle school students who like to stand for , OR say , the Pledge of Allegiance .Even many better - behaved students would continue to chatter over the recitation , and not stand , unless asked to do so .Plain and simple .Some middle school students are quite defiant when asked to do something they do not want to do .I do n't know an educator out there who would not respond favorably to a student 's legitimate objection , whether religious or otherwise , for not wanting to stand for the pledge .I have to wonder if this was a valid objection voiced to the teacher , or rather simple student insubordination that turned into a constitutional crisis once the child went home .However , if a teacher allows one student to remain insubordinate , he / she will have lost all management authority over a very difficult age group , so calling the resource officer was perhaps a way to wrest control back of a deteriorating classroom situation .I think the whole notion of reciting the pledge needs to be re - thought if teaching careers are on the line over it .Why are we bothering to waste classroom time with this when it is clearly not wanted ? \" Only in a liberal bastion of Maryland would people stoop so low as to have the school or teacher apologize for what this country stands for . \"Several posters on this issue have expressed this or similar sentiments .What they do n't realize is that the pledge actually is very much antithetical to what this country really does stand for .This is apparent just from PAYING ATTENTION to what the pledge actually SAYS .Most of the points in the pledge either are clearly and demonstrably not true , or are highly debatable .The \" under God \" part , for example .When I look at many of the things this country does , especially in terms of its foreign policy , and its flimsy justifications of thos policies , it 's clear to me that God has NOTHING to do with that .And there 's the \" indivisible \" part .Is the U.S.A. REALLY \" indivisible \" ?Some might think the Civil War settled that issue , but it did n't , not really .All that happened then is that the Union forced the Confederate states back into the Union literally at gun point .The issue of whether the separatist states had the legal and moral -- i.e. , constitutional -- right to secede from the Union has NEVER been settled in the courts .Lincoln even threatened to arrest the Supreme Court justices to prevent them from ruling on the issue .I identify seven points in the pledge of allegiance , and I have serious issues with every one of them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.436646"}

Knuckles Elementary School , says it 's been a year since she spanked a student .It 's been four years for Juanita Clark , principal at West Lumberton Elementary .You wo n't find many people paddling much these days , \" said Verdia Deese , principal at Union Elementary .That decline in spankings reflects a national trend .The use of paddling as punishment has dropped to less than one - third of what it was in 1980 , according to the National Coalition to Abolish Corporal Punishment in Schools .Henry Byrd , assistant superintendent of administrative services , said he has seen a tremendous cutback in the use of corporal punishment over the last five years .Litigious times .While 28 states have banned corporal punishment , it is still practiced in 22 states , including North Carolina , where state law allows school boards and principals to set their own policies .But school systems that allow corporal punishment operate under the constant shadow of civil litigation .Earlier this month , a Clay County principal made his first court appearance after a parent charged him with misdemeanor child abuse .The parent said Mickey Noe went too far when he spanked his 10-year - old son and left bruises on the boy 's leg .Researchers with the University of North Carolina could find only one similar charge against a principal , which was later dismissed .North Carolina educators have immunity from criminal conviction unless the punishment caused or is likely to cause permanent injury , or the punishment was given out of malice .State law forbids educators from being sued for damages for corporal punishment - related injuries unless they could have foreseen that the punishment might cause permanent injury .Robeson County 's policy says a teacher , principal or assistant principal can administer corporal punishment , but only after lesser punishments have been tried .The student must have been warned that a spanking might result if further misbehavior is observed .Spankings must be given in the presence of a principal , assistant principal or teacher , and parents must give school officials permission beforehand .Spare the rod .The parent in the Clay County incident gave the principal permission to spank his child .And for that reason , East Robeson Elementary Principal James Coleman says the state should ban corporal punishment administered by school officials .Coleman , like many Robeson County principals , said he prefers allowing parents to come to school and spank their child .West Lumberton 's principal agreed .I 've worked too long and hard to jeopardize my career , \" said Clark .\" We live in a day and age where educators have to walk a fine line when administering corporal punishment .Too many people are looking at every avenue to sue to get a little extra money .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.729645"}
