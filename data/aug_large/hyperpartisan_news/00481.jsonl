{"text": "For years it struggled to gain attention .Mr Farage 's tactical genius was to turn it into a populist anti - Establishment party , articulating deep - seated public anxieties about the two great taboos of modern political debate : Europe and immigration .In many corners of the media , as well as in Westminster itself , both of these issues are regarded as toxic .Yet by ignoring them , the politicians have simply handed them to Mr Farage .In the few days before Thursday 's elections , most of the coverage hinged on immigration .When an exhausted Mr Farage said he would not want Romanians to move in next door to him , many commentators declared that he had committed an unforgivable gaffe which would poison his national reputation and destroy his support overnight .I was reminded , however , of an interview Margaret Thatcher gave during a by - election campaign in Ilford in 1978 , when she remarked that people were frightened of being ' swamped ' by immigrants .Like Mr Farage , she was seen as having committed a dreadful error .However , the supposed gaffe struck a chord , and the Tories promptly romped to victory .The truth is that the immigration issue has been simmering unhealthily away for at least 40 years .As early as the late-1960s , polls showed that among young and old alike , mass immigration was by far the most unpopular development of the decade .Among Britain 's politicians , however , immigration has always been the ultimate taboo .When Enoch Powell spoke out in 1968 , he was roundly condemned and thrown off the Tory front bench .Then as now , in other words , there was a wide gulf between what people thought at Westminster and what people thought in the rest of the country .Writing a few days after the speech , the Guardian 's star columnist Peter Jenkins dismissed arguments that Powell and his admirers were merely racist .What motivated them , Jenkins wrote , was the feeling that ' the politicians are conspiring against the people , that the country is led by men who have no idea about what interests or frightens the ordinary people in the back streets of Wolverhampton ' .That sounds pretty familiar to me .Some of Mr Farage 's supporters may , indeed , be racially prejudiced , and certainly one or two of his councillors have some jaw - dropping medieval opinions .But I think there is much more to it than the prejudices of a minority .For decades , surveys have shown that millions of ordinary people dislike the European Union and are alarmed by the influx of so many newcomers , especially in working - class towns struggling to cope with the decline of industry and the rise of unemployment .Contrary to what the sneering metropolitan commentators like to think , the vast majority of these people are not racists .What worries them is the evaporation of jobs which are going overseas , the stagnation of real wages , the shortage of decent housing , the overcrowding of primary schools and the rising pressure on hospital wards and A&E departments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.45123"}

'That is putting it mildly - not least since the results in the European elections , which will not be counted until tomorrow , are expected to be even better for Ukip .To get a sense of how far Mr Farage 's party has come , consider this .In the 2010 General Election , Ukip won just 3 per cent of the vote .It does not have a single MP , its last election manifesto was wildly incoherent and , with the exception of the ebullient Mr Farage , its representatives are utterly obscure .Yet for the second consecutive year , Ukip has won around a fifth of the national vote .Defying all the predictions , it has gained more than 100 council seats .In Essex , it denied the Tories victory in Basildon , Castle Point and Southend .And in Rotherham , supposedly a working - class Labour bastion , its candidates averaged a whopping 47 per cent of the vote .By any standards this represents a political earthquake .Since the 1930s , British politics has essentially been a two - and - a - half - party system , with the Tories and Labour monopolising the dance floor and the Lib Dems , in their various forms , lurking half - heartedly on the fringes .What is now clear is that those days are finished .Neither David Cameron nor Ed Miliband has the slightest hope of winning as much as 40 per cent of the vote at the next General Election .And given Ukip 's performance over the past few years , it would be a brave man who would bet against them picking up at least 10 per cent of the vote - and maybe more - in May 2015 .The really extraordinary thing is that this has been the achievement of one man .Who would have believed that the outspoken Nigel Farage , a privately - educated former City trader who has never won a Westminster seat , would inspire such enthusiasm among ordinary voters from the housing estates of Essex to the post - industrial towns of South Yorkshire ?

{"text": "That is not a \" United States of Europe \" .The EU Commission , which Reding carelessly refers to as the \" government \" of her envisioned USE , is already the executive branch , and would continue to be so .But it is not an elected body : by the U.S. Constitution , in case Commissioner Reding had missed it , the chief of the executive branch - the President of the United States - is elected every four years .( He is also banned from serving more than two terms , a restriction I doubt any EY Commissioner would ever accept ... ) .There are two ways to copy this into the EU : by having direct elections in each country for one Commissioner , or by replacing the Commission with one person , i.e. , a president .As for the two chambers - the legislature - the \" Senate of Member States \" could actually be modeled after the erstwhile U.S. Senate , where members were appointed by the states .But even if that is what she has in mind , the two - chamber legislative body would only resemble U.S. Congress if it held the exclusive legislative power for the EU government .The only exception to the executive - legislative dichotomy in the U.S. Constitution is the power of executive orders that Congress granted the presidency a long time ago .It has been abused from time to time , and it is likely that there will be revisions to that power once the Obama era is finally over .Nevertheless , even with the executive order exception the U.S. Constitution is comparatively firm in its emphasis on separation of powers .This is not going to happen in Europe .On the contrary , what Commissioner Reding seems to have in mind - and you can be a nice steak dinner that the rest of the Commission is behind her \" vision \" - is something entirely different than a constitutional republic .The Telegraph again : .Mrs Reding 's vision , which is shared by many in the European institutions , would transform the EU into superstate relegating national governments and parliaments to a minor political role equivalent to that played by local councils in Britain .That alone is a violation of the U.S. Constitution .The federal government 's powers are enumerated , and even though Congress and the President sometimes behave as though there was no enumeration , court battles and state legislation constantly keep the enumeration principle alive .Two recent examples : states have started rolling back or exiting Obamacare , and a growing number of states say completely no to the new , idiotic federal attempt at creating a national school curriculum ( known as \" Common Core \" ) .But wait - there 's more : .Under [ Commissioner Reding 's ] plan , the commission would have supremacy over governments and MEPs in the European Parliament would supersede the sovereignty of MPs in the House of Commons .National leaders , meeting as the European Council , would be reduced to consultative , second chamber role similar to the House of Lords .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.33891"}

{"text": "However , the supposed gaffe struck a chord , and the Tories promptly romped to victory .The truth is that the immigration issue has been simmering unhealthily away for at least 40 years .As early as the late-1960s , polls showed that among young and old alike , mass immigration was by far the most unpopular development of the decade .Among Britain 's politicians , however , immigration has always been the ultimate taboo .When Enoch Powell spoke out in 1968 , he was roundly condemned and thrown off the Tory front bench .Then as now , in other words , there was a wide gulf between what people thought at Westminster and what people thought in the rest of the country .Writing a few days after the speech , the Guardian 's star columnist Peter Jenkins dismissed arguments that Powell and his admirers were merely racist .What motivated them , Jenkins wrote , was the feeling that ' the politicians are conspiring against the people , that the country is led by men who have no idea about what interests or frightens the ordinary people in the back streets of Wolverhampton ' .That sounds pretty familiar to me .Some of Mr Farage 's supporters may , indeed , be racially prejudiced , and certainly one or two of his councillors have some jaw - dropping medieval opinions .But I think there is much more to it than the prejudices of a minority .For decades , surveys have shown that millions of ordinary people dislike the European Union and are alarmed by the influx of so many newcomers , especially in working - class towns struggling to cope with the decline of industry and the rise of unemployment .Contrary to what the sneering metropolitan commentators like to think , the vast majority of these people are not racists .What worries them is the evaporation of jobs which are going overseas , the stagnation of real wages , the shortage of decent housing , the overcrowding of primary schools and the rising pressure on hospital wards and A&E departments .Britain 's political and media classes , however , have shown themselves almost entirely uninterested - and for depressingly obvious reasons .Most British politicians inhabit a gilded bubble .They are often born into comfortable households , go to private schools ( or elite comprehensives ) and then spend three years at Oxford or Cambridge before becoming political researchers , special advisers and MPs .Well - heeled politicians such as David Cameron , Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg , like their friends and allies in the liberal media , see only the benefits of European membership and the unfettered movement of labour .To them , immigration means cheaper au pairs , cleaners and builders .Because they rarely see the world outside Westminster , except on flying visits to their constituencies , they have no sense of the anxiety in working - class communities and are quick to condemn anybody who violates their shared taboo .One example tells a wider story .Last year , the former editor of Prospect magazine , David Goodhart , published a book ( serialised in the Mail ) , arguing that immigration was undermining national solidarity and the welfare state , and should , therefore , be curtailed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.856285"}

'The Ukip fox , ' Mr Farage said delightedly yesterday , ' is in the Westminster hen house . 'That is putting it mildly - not least since the results in the European elections , which will not be counted until tomorrow , are expected to be even better for Ukip .To get a sense of how far Mr Farage 's party has come , consider this .In the 2010 General Election , Ukip won just 3 per cent of the vote .It does not have a single MP , its last election manifesto was wildly incoherent and , with the exception of the ebullient Mr Farage , its representatives are utterly obscure .Yet for the second consecutive year , Ukip has won around a fifth of the national vote .Defying all the predictions , it has gained more than 100 council seats .In Essex , it denied the Tories victory in Basildon , Castle Point and Southend .And in Rotherham , supposedly a working - class Labour bastion , its candidates averaged a whopping 47 per cent of the vote .By any standards this represents a political earthquake .Since the 1930s , British politics has essentially been a two - and - a - half - party system , with the Tories and Labour monopolising the dance floor and the Lib Dems , in their various forms , lurking half - heartedly on the fringes .What is now clear is that those days are finished .Neither David Cameron nor Ed Miliband has the slightest hope of winning as much as 40 per cent of the vote at the next General Election .And given Ukip 's performance over the past few years , it would be a brave man who would bet against them picking up at least 10 per cent of the vote - and maybe more - in May 2015 .The really extraordinary thing is that this has been the achievement of one man .Who would have believed that the outspoken Nigel Farage , a privately - educated former City trader who has never won a Westminster seat , would inspire such enthusiasm among ordinary voters from the housing estates of Essex to the post - industrial towns of South Yorkshire ? 'When he walked on to the stage in Portsmouth , ' wrote one reporter in last week 's Spectator magazine , ' the crowd rose for him with a fervour I 've never witnessed at a mainstream party conference .

{"text": "To get a sense of how far Mr Farage 's party has come , consider this .In the 2010 General Election , Ukip won just 3 per cent of the vote .It does not have a single MP , its last election manifesto was wildly incoherent and , with the exception of the ebullient Mr Farage , its representatives are utterly obscure .Yet for the second consecutive year , Ukip has won around a fifth of the national vote .Defying all the predictions , it has gained more than 100 council seats .In Essex , it denied the Tories victory in Basildon , Castle Point and Southend .And in Rotherham , supposedly a working - class Labour bastion , its candidates averaged a whopping 47 per cent of the vote .By any standards this represents a political earthquake .Since the 1930s , British politics has essentially been a two - and - a - half - party system , with the Tories and Labour monopolising the dance floor and the Lib Dems , in their various forms , lurking half - heartedly on the fringes .What is now clear is that those days are finished .Neither David Cameron nor Ed Miliband has the slightest hope of winning as much as 40 per cent of the vote at the next General Election .And given Ukip 's performance over the past few years , it would be a brave man who would bet against them picking up at least 10 per cent of the vote - and maybe more - in May 2015 .The really extraordinary thing is that this has been the achievement of one man .Who would have believed that the outspoken Nigel Farage , a privately - educated former City trader who has never won a Westminster seat , would inspire such enthusiasm among ordinary voters from the housing estates of Essex to the post - industrial towns of South Yorkshire ? 'When he walked on to the stage in Portsmouth , ' wrote one reporter in last week 's Spectator magazine , ' the crowd rose for him with a fervour I 've never witnessed at a mainstream party conference . 'There is , of course , an obvious explanation .What Mr Farage has tapped into is a widespread national discontent that can not merely be dismissed - as some metropolitan commentators have tried to do - as racism or xenophobia .Ukip was founded in 1993 as an obscure anti - federalist pressure group .For years it struggled to gain attention .Mr Farage 's tactical genius was to turn it into a populist anti - Establishment party , articulating deep - seated public anxieties about the two great taboos of modern political debate : Europe and immigration .In many corners of the media , as well as in Westminster itself , both of these issues are regarded as toxic .Yet by ignoring them , the politicians have simply handed them to Mr Farage .In the few days before Thursday 's elections , most of the coverage hinged on immigration .When an exhausted Mr Farage said he would not want Romanians to move in next door to him , many commentators declared that he had committed an unforgivable gaffe which would poison his national reputation and destroy his support overnight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.64743"}

{"text": "That translated into the continued electoral dominance of Ch\u00e1vez 's political heirs , who are still unbeatable today at the ballot box in the parts of Venezuelan society he organized .Not only that , but it 's also the reason why these same people proved to be so loyal to Ch\u00e1vez , and willing to work and fight for the movement he led whenever their support was needed .So for example in 2002 , when Venezuela 's elite ousted Ch\u00e1vez in a coup , his massive base took to the streets and made it impossible for the ruling junta to govern .Most importantly , the military rank and file could not be counted on to follow junta orders to suppress those massive street demonstrations .That meant checkmate for the coup leaders : In just 48 hours , Ch\u00e1vez was back in the presidential palace and the coup leaders were under arrest or in hiding .That 's what real organized power looks like .Paraguay 's would - be equivalent to Chavez , Fernando Lugo , was also an outsider .Lugo broke the Colorado Party 's 60-year one - party reign in Paraguay after winning the presidency in 2008 .That alone is a very weak foundation for political power , especially if you are running on a platform that plans to challenge entrenched elites .Lugo offered the Liberal Party the vice presidency plus several cabinet seats .In exchange , the Liberals lent Lugo their party structure .Until they decided to take it back , that is .The Liberal Party quickly grew tired of Lugo 's populist politics and started negotiating with their supposed enemies , the Colorados , to oust him .Which they finally did last year , orchestrating a sham , record - speed impeachment ( it took all of one day to oust Lugo ) based on very dubious charges .A lot of Paraguayans denounced the impeachment of Fernando Lugo as a coup , but almost no one was ready to take the streets or go on strike to defend the ousted president .Unlike Ch\u00e1vez , Lugo had no real power base to counter the old Paraguayan elite .So he took it , went home with his head down , leaving office with what at the time sounded like an oddly acquiescent and not at all combative farewell speech .In hindsight , it 's clear now that Lugo knew his situation better than those of us watching that speech on TV - that he had no one to fight for him , and that he 'd have to start from scratch .Responding to coups is just one of the most obvious , visible examples of what I 'm talking about , but there 's much more to territorial politics than this .Having an organized network of people that the leadership trusts enables them to understand what 's going on at the grassroots level , like political intelligence that 's reliable .What are ordinary people unhappy about ?Is the government ( whether you 're part of it or not ) doing things that have unexpected negative consequences in their everyday lives ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.77841"}
{"text": "That is putting it mildly - not least since the results in the European elections , which will not be counted until tomorrow , are expected to be even better for Ukip .To get a sense of how far Mr Farage 's party has come , consider this .In the 2010 General Election , Ukip won just 3 per cent of the vote .It does not have a single MP , its last election manifesto was wildly incoherent and , with the exception of the ebullient Mr Farage , its representatives are utterly obscure .Yet for the second consecutive year , Ukip has won around a fifth of the national vote .Defying all the predictions , it has gained more than 100 council seats .In Essex , it denied the Tories victory in Basildon , Castle Point and Southend .And in Rotherham , supposedly a working - class Labour bastion , its candidates averaged a whopping 47 per cent of the vote .By any standards this represents a political earthquake .Since the 1930s , British politics has essentially been a two - and - a - half - party system , with the Tories and Labour monopolising the dance floor and the Lib Dems , in their various forms , lurking half - heartedly on the fringes .What is now clear is that those days are finished .Neither David Cameron nor Ed Miliband has the slightest hope of winning as much as 40 per cent of the vote at the next General Election .And given Ukip 's performance over the past few years , it would be a brave man who would bet against them picking up at least 10 per cent of the vote - and maybe more - in May 2015 .The really extraordinary thing is that this has been the achievement of one man .Who would have believed that the outspoken Nigel Farage , a privately - educated former City trader who has never won a Westminster seat , would inspire such enthusiasm among ordinary voters from the housing estates of Essex to the post - industrial towns of South Yorkshire ? 'When he walked on to the stage in Portsmouth , ' wrote one reporter in last week 's Spectator magazine , ' the crowd rose for him with a fervour I 've never witnessed at a mainstream party conference . 'There is , of course , an obvious explanation .What Mr Farage has tapped into is a widespread national discontent that can not merely be dismissed - as some metropolitan commentators have tried to do - as racism or xenophobia .Ukip was founded in 1993 as an obscure anti - federalist pressure group .For years it struggled to gain attention .Mr Farage 's tactical genius was to turn it into a populist anti - Establishment party , articulating deep - seated public anxieties about the two great taboos of modern political debate : Europe and immigration .In many corners of the media , as well as in Westminster itself , both of these issues are regarded as toxic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.793915"}

{"text": "Ukip may have been forced to disown its 2010 general election manifesto ( which Farage now refers to as ' drivel ' ) , but it gives you a taste of the carnage that it would unleash if given half a chance .Not content with the slash and burn approach of the Tories , it pledged to go even further , reducing public spending to 1997 's levels and slashing two million public sector jobs .Ukip may want to win voters struggling under the cruelty of benefit cuts in Wythenshawe now , but in 2010 , it pledged to abolish incapacity benefit completely .What 's more , only months ago Farage was decrying the Tories ' failure to ' deal with the deficit ' and claiming only Ukip would be bold enough to ' properly ' cut the NHS and pensions , pledging an additional \u00a3 77 billion of cuts .Now , when he 's asked about policies on welfare , education and public spending , Farage refuses to talk about domestic policies until after 22 May.However , in the few places Ukip has councillors they have often voted for cuts - even while in opposition .In Suffolk one Ukip councillor even went to the lengths of using the voting card of his absent colleague to ' vote twice ' for a Conservative cuts budget ( now the subject of an investigation ) .Farage 's popular image is itself a carefully constructed lie : A straight - talking ' everyman ' , complete with a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other , he apparently relishes the chance to stick it to the political and social elites .Commenting on Ukip 's mission , Farage recently claimed : \" My priority is a new political party and movement in this country that wants to stand up for the interests of ordinary people \" .Ordinarily posh .But ' ordinary ' would be an inappropriate adjective to apply to Nigel .This privately educated ( Dulwich College ) millionaire is a former stockbroker , and is himself very much a member of the privileged elite .He was a Tory throughout Margaret Thatcher 's war on the working class , only leaving in protest at the John Major government 's signing of the Treaty on European Union at Maastricht .While Farage is keen to decry ' Eurocrats ' he neglects to mention that he has been stuffing his pockets with over \u00a3 60,000 worth of expenses .Unabashed by Leveson and revelations about phone hacking , Nigel Farage recently accepted an invitation to a fancy dinner with Rupert Murdoch .Perhaps that partly explains the mountains of favourable coverage Ukip has been receiving in the Sun !The Ukip National Executive also includes disgraced ex - Tory MP Neil Hamilton , of ' cash for questions ' fame .So any profession by Ukip to represent a clean break from corrupt politicians is laughable .Moreover , despite the party 's deputy leader Paul Nuttall harking back to the days when \" Labour MPs came from the mills and the mines \" , his party has no interest in giving the working class any say in the policies of his party .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.289764"}
