{"text": "Among his ideas for his Florida project was his proposed EPCOT , the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow , which was to be a futuristic planned city ( and which was also known as Progress City ) .He envisioned a real working city with both commercial and residential areas , but one that also continued to showcase and test new ideas and concepts for urban living .Therefore , the Disney Company petitioned the Florida State Legislature for the creation of the Reedy Creek Improvement District , which would have almost total autonomy within its borders .The planned EPCOT city was also emphasized in this lobbying effort .Chapter 67 - 764 of the Laws of Florida was eventually signed into law by Governor Claude R. Kirk , Jr. on May 12 , 1967 , creating the District .On the same day , Governor Kirk also signed the incorporation acts for two cities inside the District : Bay Lake ( Chapter 67 - 1104 ) and Reedy Creek ( Chapter 67 - 1965 ) .( The City of Reedy Creek was renamed to the City of Lake Buena Vista around 1970 . )The original city boundaries did not cover the whole Improvement District ; they may have been intended as the areas where communities would be built for people to live .Naming .Reedy Creek is a natural waterway , the course of which runs mostly through undeveloped territory east of Haines City .Objections .The Improvement District has far - reaching powers .Through the District , Disney could construct almost anything within its borders , including a nuclear power plant ( which it never built , opting instead for a more traditional plant that supplements power from outside of the District ) .The District , as with any municipal corporation , can issue tax - free bonds for internal improvements .This became a point of contention when a 1985 law limited the amount of tax - free bonds in Florida .The eligible bonds were chosen randomly , causing the District to beat out Orange County , which had planned to build low - income housing , in 1989 .In addition to the power of eminent domain outside the District , the one other power that the District was given ( that it would not have had if it were simply the two cities ) was an exemption to state zoning and land use laws .When the state later established the Development of Regional Impact study process , Disney , through the District , was able to avoid the paperwork and streamline the process to build theme parks and other attractions .On the other hand , county taxes , including property and sales taxes , still apply within the District .After Walt Disney died in 1966 before his vision was realized , the Disney Company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city , and eventually abandoned many of his ideas for Progress City .The planned residential areas were thus never built , causing some to cry foul .Most notably , Richard Foglesong argues in his book , Married to the Mouse : Walt Disney World and Orlando , that Disney has abused its powers by remaining in complete control of the District .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.70046"}
