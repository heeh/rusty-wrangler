{"text": "The Criminal Alien Program ( CAP ) : Immigration Enforcement in Prisons and Jails .The Criminal Alien Program ( CAP ) is an expansive immigration enforcement program that leads to the initiation of removal proceedings in many cases .While CAP has existed in one form or another for decades , there is still much to be learned about the program , how it is organized , and how it works .What is known is that CAP extends to every area of the country and intersects with most state and local law enforcement agencies .For years , the CAP program has operated with little public attention and many of its elements have only recently come to light following FOIA litigation against Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) .The information obtained through the lawsuit regarding CAP 's current organization and staffing suggests CAP is not a single program , but a loose - knit group of several different programs operating within ICE .Other than a small number of staff responsible for the administration of CAP at ICE headquarters , there is no dedicated CAP staff .Rather , ICE pulls personnel and resources from across the agency to perform CAP - related functions .The ICE declarations and deposition also explain how CAP functions within prisons and jails .There appears to be little consistency in , and little or no policy governing , how CAP cooperates with state and local law enforcement agencies in different regions and in how CAP interacts with detainees in different facilities .Instead , CAP appears to function as an ad hoc set of activities that operate differently across the country and across penal institutions , raising questions about the adequacy of oversight , training , and accountability of the personnel implementing CAP .This information confirms that there is still much about CAP that remains unknown or unclear .Given the breadth of CAP , the centrality of its role in immigration enforcement , and its large impact on the immigrant community , it is critical that ICE clarify how CAP operates .What is the Criminal Alien Program ( CAP ) ?The core goal of CAP is the identification of allegedly removable noncitizens who are incarcerated in jails and prisons , and the initiation of removal proceedings against them .CAP is currently active in all state and federal prisons , as well as more than 300 local jails throughout the country .It is one of several so - called \" jail status check \" programs intended to screen individuals in federal , state , or local prisons and jails for removability .While other such jail status check programs , like Secure Communities , have garnered much more attention , CAP is by far the oldest and largest such interface between the criminal justice system and federal immigration authorities .CAP also encompasses other activities , including the investigation and arrest of nondetained noncitizens .CAP and its predecessors were created in response to the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act ( IRCA ) .IRCA required the Attorney General , \" in the case of an alien who is convicted of an offense which makes the alien subject to deportation ...
