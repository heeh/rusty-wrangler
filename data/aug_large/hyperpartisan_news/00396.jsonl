'I can risk my safety , but ca n't put my kids at risk , ' she said , asking if she should withdraw her complaint .She had not been to work for 2 whole days , scared of leaving her kids home and fearing an acid attack - when she could ill afford absences from work and pay cuts .I called up the Usmanpur police station , and spoke to the Duty Officer there .After some back and forth calls , he informed me there was no record of the woman 's complaint . 'She has n't given it in writing , ' he said , asking me to send her again to the police station .I told him she would not visit the police station again , and that he must send someone to her home immediately .After a while , the woman called to say the cops visiting her home wanted to speak to me .One of them took the phone to tell me they were trying in vain to trace the bike , which probably had a wrong number plate .I asked him why no FIR had been registered and why the PS had no record of her complaint , if attempts were being made to trace the stalker ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.40689"}
