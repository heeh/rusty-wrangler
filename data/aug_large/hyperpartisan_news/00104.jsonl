Maggie Hassan , Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Rep. Annie Kuster , according to The Hill .One of the undecided superdelegates is Ray Buckley , chairman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party , who was barred by state party rules from selecting a candidate prior to the primary in an effort to maintain neutrality .Days after two of Hillary Clinton 's most prominent female surrogates , Madeleine K. Albright and Gloria Steinem , drew fire for their comments about young women supporting Senator Bernie Sanders , another Clinton surrogate proposed that the two women be pulled from campaigning for Mrs. Clinton .The dust - up began on Saturday when Ms. Albright , 78 , the first female secretary of state , criticized Mr. Sanders 's \" revolution \" and said electing the first woman as president would be the real revolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.460014"}

Bush anyway .Still it would make sense to chose a candidate who is trusted by the voters going into a general election campaign .Of the $ 47.5 million that Mrs. Clinton has raised , less than one - fifth has come from donations of $ 200 or less .That is a far smaller proportion than that of her Democratic and Republican rivals who have excited grass - roots donors on the left and right , such as Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ted Cruz of Texas .While Mr. Sanders raised far less than Mrs. Clinton over all - about $ 15 million , including money transferred from his Senate account - about four - fifths of that amount came from smaller donors .Total contributions is probably the more important factor with regards to winning elections , but this gap might also indicate that those who support Clinton in the polls are also less enthusiastic about turning out to vote in primaries and caucuses .Despite the idea that corporations are people , it takes real voters and not corporate donors turning out to win primary elections .Clinton also got the first major union endorsement , but there has also been grass roots opposition to the recent decision by the American Federation of Teachers to endorse Clinton .While Clinton has a tremendous lead for the Democratic nomination at this time , she also has significant weaknesses which could still influence the outcome .The contrasting campaign styles of Clinton compared to Sanders and O'Malley , along with other potential candidates entering the race , could impact the opinions of those who now state they support Clinton , largely based upon a combination of name recognition , nostalgia , and gender .The increased disqualification we are seeing with the status quo could lead to unanticipated results .As I have discussed previously , polls at this stage have very limited predictive value with regards to the ultimate election results .Patrick Egan looked at various polling data and found only one which appears meaningful in predicting election results - presidential approval .While this is based upon a limited number of elections , and other factors certainly could impact the final election results , Obama 's improving popularity in some ( but not all ) polls should be encouraging for Democrats going into the general election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.25805"}

Ted Cruz of Texas delivered a hard - fought upset win over businessman Donald Trump in the Iowa Republican caucuses Monday night , making good on his bet that a methodical campaign organization would eclipse the New Yorker 's media dominance in the first test of GOP voters .With 99 percent of the precincts reporting , Cruz was besting Trump by more than 5,100 votes , with fellow senator Marco Rubio of Florida a close third .Cruz appeared to capitalize on deep support from religious and social conservatives and showed that old - fashioned retail politicking could overcome Trump 's massive political rallies in the Hawkeye state .The final Des Moines Register poll is in ahead of today 's Iowa Caucus , and it shows that Donald Trump has the support of 28 % of likely caucus goers , with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 23 % and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 15 % .The poll was taken beginning the day after Trump announced he would skip last week 's GOP debate .Who knows whether that decision will come back to haunt him or not .We shall also see where the polls back up caucus goers .On the Democratic side , the survey finds former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with 45 % support to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ' 42 % .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.682335"}
{"text": "Candidates should be judged by the same standards , regardless of party .The generational gap , with the young supporting Sanders over Clinton regardless of gender , is reminiscent of the generational gap between those who supported Obama over Clinton eight years ago : .The generational gap haunted Mrs. Clinton in the 2008 primary : In Iowa , Mr. Obama took 51 percent , John Edwards 19 percent and Mrs. Clinton just 11 percent of the caucus vote among women younger than 24 .The only demographic cohort that Mrs. Clinton won , exit polls showed , was women older than 65 ... .Mrs. Clinton 's standing among white women has declined in some recent polls , but women remain the backbone of her support .More than half of all women said they had a favorable opinion of Mrs. Clinton , compared with 36 percent of men , according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this month .But just 38 percent of women aged 18 to 29 said they supported Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary , compared with 40 percent for Mr. Sanders , according to a poll of 2,011 young people released Thursday by Harvard 's Institute of Politics .A major question in this campaign will be how young voters , former Obama voters , and voters who have not typically participated in the nominating system turn out in Iowa and New Hampshire .Polling does not give a reliable indicator of such caucus and primary states , as I have discussed many times before , as most voters do not decide until the last minute , and pollsters can not reliably determine who will turn out to vote .It is always dangerous to count on young voters , who vote in smaller percentages than older voters .I am hopeful that having the Iowa caucus take place this year after students are back at school , as opposed to over the holiday break eight years ago , will lead to an improvement in their participation .Sanders ' views are far more in tune with those of the young , and hopefully his support will increase as more people become aware of the vast differences in his views compared to Clinton 's .Those who are concerned about the state of the economy and getting good jobs , are likely to join Sanders ' coalition as opposed to supporting the policies from Clinton to benefit her Wall Street cronies .While fear of terrorism is once again affecting the electorate , overall Sanders ' views should be preferable to the militaristic , neoconservative views of Hillary Clinton .Younger voters who tend to be more secular and socially liberal should prefer Sanders over Clinton 's socially conservative and more theocratic views .Younger voters who tend to be more libertarian on civil liberties issues should prefer Sanders over Clinton .The important thing is that voters look at the actual candidates , and not vote simply based upon gender .It is a hopeful sign that young women are not making the same mistake which many older women are with their knee jerk support of Hillary Clinton .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.14424"}

Putnam 's Sons in 2009 .It was very well reviewed and sold well enough that Putnam contracted me for two more books toward building a regular series .The safe ( and possibly sane ) course of action would have been to stick with Putnam and all the benefits of publishing with a big house .My experience with Putnam was largely positive , and I 'd beaten the odds by landing with them in the first place .But ... .But I was n't satisfied with the book Putnam put out or their support of it .Additionally , I was simply more ambitious about the Wildes than Putnam was , and had wanted the books to be fully illustrated .With this in mind , before I 'd even finished writing the book I 'd sought and found the perfect artist for it , a hellaciously talented Aussie named Gary Chaloner .Gary read what I 'd written to that point and fell in love with the characters and agreed to join the Wilde team .While I finished the book , he put a lot of time and work into getting the characters just right , and I loved his take on my heros .A fellow pulp - fan , Gary understood the Wildes in his bones , and his images were dynamic and clever and made my story look good .The picture atop this post is one of his .When they bought Frogs of Doom , Putnam disregarded all the work Gary had already done and my aspiration for nicely illustrated volumes .Now , that 's not unusual , not many authors actually have much say in the covers that get stuck on their books .But since I 'd been through months of collaborative effort with my artist of choice , who had labored meticulously to honor my vision , I was naturally even more dissatisfied by the outcome .So , inspired by the independent publishing revolution , I decided to take matters into my own hands .I managed to work some loophole sorcery and not only wriggled out of the contract for the next two books but regained full rights to Doc Wilde and The Frogs of Doom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.853485"}
