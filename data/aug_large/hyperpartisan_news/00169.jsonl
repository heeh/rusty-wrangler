William Leonard , a former director of the government 's Information Security Oversight Office , said that in Mrs. Clinton 's case , criminal charges like those against Mr. Drake are highly unlikely .But as a former security official , he said , he was dismayed by her exclusive use of private email .The State Department has an obligation to monitor unclassified email for exactly this kind of classified spillage , he said , as well as to protect computer systems and provide emails to Congress or the public when required by law .\" The agency ca n't fulfill those legal responsibilities if it does n't have control over the server , \" Mr. Leonard said .Besides these cases , there have been two high profile prosecutions regarding improper handling of classified information , David Petraeus and , as I discussed last week , former Clinton national security adviser Sandy Berger .If the reports of classified information on Clinton 's private server are true , and if Clinton is treated like the others , she will be indicted .Possibly the \" Clinton Rules \" will apply here with others receiving the blame , and she will escape such a fate , but this would still seriously harm her in an election campaign .The Republicans might very well also destroy themselves and Clinton could still win , but nominating Clinton now looks like too great a risk for any political party to take .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.65471"}

{"text": "Today on my KPFK /Pacifica Radio show --- after breaking the news about the newly elected Pope --- I interviewed Eugene Iredale , attorney of the former San Diego ACORN worker Juan Carlos Vera who received a $ 100,000 settlement from Rightwing con - artist James O'Keefe last week .( Vera also received $ 50,000 from O'Keefe 's former partner Hannah Giles in a separate settlement last summer . )Vera 's California Invasion of Privacy Act lawsuit , filed in 2010 , stemmed from O'Keefe and Giles ' surreptitious wiretapping of a \" confidential \" conversation with Vera .P.S. I invited O'Keefe to join today 's show to offer his side of the story ( live and not deceptively edited ) , but last night he seems to have decided he did n't \" have the guts \" to show up .--- with a donation to help us keep going ( Snail mail , more options here ) .If you like , we 'll send you some great , award - winning election integrity documentary films in return !Details right here ... .We will not be joined as well by O'Keefe himself , unfortunately , despite my invitations to him after his ' I 'm the victim here ! 'tweets last week when news of the settlement broke .He had described media coverage of the settlement agreement as \" lies and lies and more lies from journafascists \" and attempted to taunt the media to \" have the guts \" to allow him to tell his side of the story .We took him up on that offer and invited him to appear on The BradCast today , live !Which is impossible to deceptively edit !( You 're welcome , Jimmy ! )But until late last night he did n't \" have the guts \" to even respond to my generous invitation .After a second invite last night , however , I finally heard back from him ... .O'Keefe and Giles ' illicit taping of Vera was carried out as part of the deceptively edited series of hit videos released by the pair in 2009 .The tapes were published , and paid for , by the late con - man Andrew Breitbart .Vera had been portrayed in the misleading video as having been willing to help the pair smuggle underage prostitutes into the United States across the Mexican border .In fact , Vera had played along with the duo 's ridiculous proposed scheme only long enough to collect information from O'Keefe and Giles ( and take their photographs ) , before contacting law enforcement immediately after the secretly video - taped meeting .During the course of Vera 's lawsuit , it was revealed that Breitbart , who died in March of 2012 , had agreed to pay the pair some $ 120,000 for their hoax tapes in $ 5,000 monthly installments to each .O'Keefe ended up collecting $ 65,000 before he was terminated around the time of his CNN \" Sex Boat \" scandal in September of 2010 .Giles ' payments , on the other hand , were reduced from $ 5,000 month to $ 3,000 at some point , before being terminated for what she described , according to Vera 's attorney , as \" a conflict of visions \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.126724"}
{"text": "It all looks like just another weak attempt by conservatives to portray themselves as victims , and one more unfounded conservative conspiracy theory .Last week the political news led to the inevitable , even if premature , discussion of the 2016 presidential race .A scandal involving Chris Christie was reported based upon its potential repercussions for the Republican nomination , even though it is far from certain that the media declaring Christie the front - runner means anything .There are far too many pictures of him with Obama to haunt him in the GOP primaries .Still , he could not be ruled out as 2012 showed how hard it is to find a true conservative Republican who does n't become a laughing stock once they actually have to discuss their views on a national stage .Hillary Clinton is a far stronger front - runner for the Democratic nomination .The 2008 race showed both that there are Democrats who do not want her and that she could be beaten , but it is hard to see someone duplicating what Obama accomplished .Clinton is certainly not going to ignore the caucus states , assuming she runs for the 2016 nomination .Therefore last week was seen as very good for Hillary Clinton .Assuming she runs , Christie polls the best against her of potential Republican candidates ( again , assuming he could win the nomination ) .Looking like the least bat - shit crazy Republican did help Christie in national polls .So far there is little public interest in Christie 's scandal , but I think it is still too early to tell .While the similarities to Watergate are too slim to justify calling this Bridgegate , it did take a while before Watergate became commonly known and harmful to Richard Nixon .The reports of Christie 's staff closing down the George Washington Bridge as an act of political retaliation have led to many other stories of similar bullying by Christie .Making matters worse , there is now an investigation as to whether Christie misused Sandy relief funds : .Just days after dismissing two top advisers for their roles in the George Washington Bridge scandal , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie faced questions over the use of Superstorm Sandy relief funds .CNN has learned that federal officials are investigating whether Christie improperly used some of that money to produce tourism ads that starred him and his family .The news could n't come at a worse time for the embattled Republican , who is facing two probes in New Jersey of whether his staff orchestrated traffic gridlock near the country 's busiest bridge to punish a Democratic mayor who refused to endorse his re - election .If the Sandy inquiry by a watchdog finds any wrongdoing , it could prove even more damaging to Christie 's national ambitions .He 's considered a possible presidential candidate in 2016 .One would think that this should be another good week for Hillary Clinton , but maybe not .Politico ( which is not above fabricating drama ) cites a book claiming Hillary Clinton maintained a hit list of those who crossed her in 2008 : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.36888"}
