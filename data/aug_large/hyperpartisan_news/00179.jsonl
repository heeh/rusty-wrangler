Edgar Hoover himself - and undoubtedly the most influential since .Later that year , his mandatory ten - year term poised to force him from office , Mueller was considered so vital to national security that Congress at President Obama 's request passed unprecedented special legislation allowing him to extend his term an additional two years .In almost any meeting now , he 's the senior and most experienced voice .\"He 's the grownup around the table , \" says one senior Justice Department official .\"He 's like EF Hutton - when he talks , people listen .He can redirect a whole conversation , because he 's been doing this the longest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.38829"}

's power is passive .They usually do n't fight you , they just wait you out .They know you will be gone in a few years , but they will not . \"In addition to this indirect exercise of power , Tuerkheimer said , the F.B.I. sometimes simply refuses to work on certain kinds of cases .To get around the problem , I had to shop around for help , finally recruiting some I.R.S. agents . \"SACs frequently are the de facto bosses of all federal enforcement in their fiefdoms .\" The theory is that the U.S. attorney in New York or Chicago or wherever is the top dog in the area when it comes to federal enforcement , \" said one senior investigator .\" But in many districts the SACs have more experience and political connections in Washington than the U.S. attorney . \" VI .A Matter of Accountability .The F.B.I. is not performing in a manner compatible with the principles or practices of representative democracy .It is an improperly political , badly managed and ineffective law - enforcement agency that is constantly seeking to grab more power .Stating the problem , however , is much easier than outlining a feasible remedy .On the one hand , to avoid the dangers of improper political influence , the F.B.I. must be isolated from the direct control of elected officials .On the other hand , to avoid the threat of a freewheeling national police force that is allowed to set its own agenda , the F.B.I. must be responsive to appropriate political review and direction .One beginning point might be to compel the attorney general actually to manage the Justice Department and its investigative agencies in accordance with laws and executive orders going back to shortly after the Civil War .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.74447"}

Mueller III , who took over a sometimes plodding bureau caught flat - footed by the Sept. 11 attacks and turned it into a fast - moving counter - terrorism agency .\" In his 10 years at the FBI , Bob Mueller has set the gold standard for leading the bureau , \" Obama said in a statement Thursday .\" I believe continuity and stability at the FBI is critical at this time , \" he added .Mueller , 66 , told the president he was willing to stay for two more years .Robert Mueller has his marching order from President Bush , who has nominated the veteran prosecutor to be the next director of the FBI .He also faces the implicit commands of congressional critics to a bureau that has become better known in recent years for its scandals and blunders than for its successes .Mueller will be expected to impose a new management style to replace what even many of the FBI 's longtime admirers now denounce as a culture of arrogance .Sen.

's targets were hardly models of representative democracy .But giving the F.B.I. and the frequently political Justice Department the authority to launch sweeping investigations of an entire municipal court , a state legislature or a large group of House and Senate members may have altered the basic relationship among the three branches of government .III .Civil Rights :Looking Away .In late 1992 a 15-year - old girl being held in a juvenile jail in Jackson , Mississippi , told the police she had been raped by one of her guards .The girl added that three other young female prisoners had also been raped .Partly because of an ongoing dispute between the city 's police chief and the county 's district attorney , the local authorities did nothing .A job for the F.B.I. , one might think .Under several Civil War - era statutes , the F.B.I. has long been the lead agency in the investigation of charges that government officials have used their powers to abuse the rights of any person , even someone in prison .But for at least nine months after the young woman 's allegations came to the attention of Joseph Jackson , Special Agent in Charge of F.B.I. enforcement activities in the state , he took no action .When finally ordered by Washington to allow a bureau investigation to go forward , Jackson retired .The F.B.I. 's nine - month delay in investigating the Mississippi prison guards was not an isolated event .In fact , the reluctance of the F.B.I. to investigate local law - enforcement agencies has been a matter of concern throughout its history .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.53592"}

' \" Specific behavior , such as who the customers are calling .The Amdocs memo says the system should be used to prevent phone fraud .But U.S. counterintelligence analysts say it could also be used to spy through the phone system .Fox News has learned that the N.S.A has held numerous classified conferences to warn the F.B.I. and C.I.A. how Amdocs records could be used .At one NSA briefing , a diagram by the Argon national lab was used to show that if the phone records are not secure , major security breaches are possible .Another briefing document said , \" It has become increasingly apparent that systems and networks are vulnerable ....Such crimes always involve unauthorized persons , or persons who exceed their authorization ... citing on exploitable vulnerabilities .\" Those vulnerabilities are growing , because according to another briefing , the U.S. relies too much on foreign companies like Amdocs for high - tech equipment and software .\" Many factors have led to increased dependence on code developed overseas ....We buy rather than train or develop solutions . \" U.S. intelligence does not believe the Israeli government is involved in a misuse of information , and Amdocs insists that its data is secure .What U.S. government officials are worried about , however , is the possibility that Amdocs data could get into the wrong hands , particularly organized crime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.35191"}

Bush , who was excoriated by hawks for pursuing supposedly \" realist \" objectives in foreign affairs .Attorneys Cheryl Mills , David Kendall and Robert Barnett are working with the Obama transition team to review information about the Clintons ' background and finances , including Bill Clinton 's post - presidential business deals and relationships with foreign governments .All three represented the Clintons on legal matters in the White House , including President Clinton 's dalliance with intern Monica Lewinsky that led to his impeachment in 1998 .Officials knowledgeable about the vetting said it has gone smoothly and that both Clintons were cooperating fully .Bill Clinton already has appeared to take an important step toward smoothing his wife 's path to the job .Democrats familiar with the negotiations said the former president has suggested he would step away from day - to - day responsibility for his charitable foundation while his wife served and would alert the State Department to his speaking schedule and any new sources of income .A top aide involved in the vetting said there was nothing obvious in the former president 's dealings that would torpedo his wife 's prospects for the job .The aide was not authorized to discuss the matter , and would speak only on background .The aide pointed out that former President George H.W. Bush has given paid speeches and participated in international business ventures since his son , George W. Bush , has been president without stirring public complaints about a conflict of interest .But another Democrat who advised Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign warned that Bill Clinton 's business arrangements were more complicated than many people realized .During the campaign , few of her senior strategists knew anything about the former president 's business deals and whether they would hold up under scrutiny if she won the nomination , this person said .The adviser spoke on background , not authorized to speak publicly for Hillary Clinton 's political operation .It was unclear whether Bill Clinton has agreed to submit financial information to the transition team that has not been made public through Hillary Clinton 's Senate disclosure requirements or during her campaign , when the couple released several years of joint tax returns .For example , still unknown are the names of donors to Bill Clinton 's foundation and presidential library or what he earns as a partner with Yucaipa Global Opportunities Fund , a private investment venture run by billionaire Ron Burkle , a close friend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.46274"}

' ' First , Gingrich is n't just saying that getting a paycheck is better than getting food stamps .No , he is specifically saying that he needs to go tell black people that fact .The positioning here is clear : that arguably the largest and most well - known organization focusing on issues of significance to African - Americans needs Newt Gingrich to bring the message to tell persons of color that they need to get off food stamps .Because , of course , otherwise , who has the courage to point this out ?Second , this forwards a stereotype of minorities as being nothing but leeches on the system .In other words , Gingrich is not saying , as a generic notion , that citizens of the US should expect policies that produce jobs rather than simply relying on social policies to help them out .No , he wants to evangelize blacks on this subject .Indeed , he says as much when he says \" the African American community should demand paychecks and not be satisfied with food stamps\"-because , apparently , they , as a community , are currently satisfied with just getting handouts .As I noted above , this may have just been a case of Gingrich being a bit tired and mixing two standard stump speech points together in an unfortunate fashion .But it 's easy to see how a comment like that opens him up to broadsides from critics .Newt may want to rethink that one before he trots it out again .Blowback .Note from Hot Air management : This section is for comments from Hot Air 's community of registered readers .Please do n't assume that Hot Air management agrees with or otherwise endorses any particular comment just because we let it stand .A reminder : Anyone who fails to comply with our terms of use may lose their posting privilege .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.82169"}

{"text": "Most of the D.E.A. 's clients have a considerably lower social position than those of the F.B.I. 's .Even when the F.B.I. and the D.E.A. are going after the same targets , however , the bureau 's record looks somewhat worse than the D.E.A. 's .Between 1992 and 1996 , in cases where the principal charges were based on the government 's two most frequently used drug laws , the D.E.A. got the green light from the prosecutors 81 percent of the time , compared with 75 percent for the F.B.I. The D.E.A. 's investigations led to prison sentences 54 percent of the time , the F.B.I. 's 49 percent .Its median was 198 days , the F.B.I. 's 264 .Everything else being equal , a high - quality investigation should require less time to prosecute than a flawed one .Patchwork Performance An essential element in the fair and effective enforcement of the law is consistency .When Congress passes a law mandating comprehensive national programs to discourage larcenous bankers , environmental outlaws or drug dealers , carefully coordinated national programs of enforcement are crucial .Equally important to achieving success is public support , a goal that requires investigators and prosecutors to live up to the constitutional ideal that the government always tries to treat similarly situated citizens in similar ways .There is considerable evidence that the F.B.I. is delivering a widely varying level of service in different parts of the country .Some district variation is of course appropriate .After all , the crime problems in Baton Rouge or Louisville may well be quite different from those in Los Angeles or Miami .But limit your consideration to the 1996 sentences imposed on F.B.I. defendants in a selected group of districts that include the nation 's biggest cities .In 1996 the median prison sentence imposed on all 11,855 people convicted on the basis of F.B.I. referrals was twenty - four months .But in the Maryland ( Baltimore ) district the median sentence was forty - eight months .How can it be that the median sentence for people convicted on the basis of F.B.I. investigations in Maryland is eight times that in California North ?Part of the explanation , of course , lies in the fact that F.B.I. agents in various parts of the country pursue very different kinds of criminals .In California North , bank robbery convictions made up only 19 percent of the F.B.I. total .Drugs was another area of considerable contrast : 22 percent in Maryland and only 1 percent in California North .On the other hand , with regard to F.B.I. convictions in which theft or embezzlement by a bank officer was the lead charge , California North was more active than Maryland .While such convictions made up 29 percent of the total in the San Francisco area , they represented only 5 percent in Maryland .But differences in the kinds of crimes that various F.B.I. offices choose to investigate offer only a partial explanation for the wide disparities in prison sentences .Another factor seems to be the competence and diligence of F.B.I. agents and prosecutors working in an individual district .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.20953"}

's constant drive to gain access to more and more information involves two programs .Under one , the nation 's telephone companies are required to install a new generation of F.B.I.-approved equipment that will make it much easier for the bureau to tap telephones and track individual suspects as they move around the country .With comparatively little public discussion , this far - reaching program was mandated by a law signed by President Clinton in October 1994 .Although the F.B.I. contends that the number of its taps will not dramatically increase when the new equipment is in place , it is hard to believe that this major boost in the capacity to tap will not result in a substantial increase .The F.B.I. campaign to force telephone companies to install new \" eavesdropping friendly \" equipment is not limited to the United States .In 1995 , after a series of meetings between the F.B.I. and representatives of a number of countries , the European Union agreed to launch a global surveillance system to combat \" serious crime \" and protect \" national security . \"The proposed system is based on standards set by the F.B.I. A second technical development that almost certainly is whetting the F.B.I. 's current appetite for wiretapping is the expected decline in the cost of transcribing recorded conversations .Wiretaps today cost the government a great deal of money because each conversation must be reviewed by an F.B.I. employee for incriminating evidence .This expense has served as an indirect brake on electronic surveillance .With rapid advances in computerized voice recognition systems able to search for key words , sentences and even broad subject matters , however , some of this reviewing effort can probably be handled by machines , so the cost of wiretapping will plummet .The F.B.I. 's continuous effort to expand its access to information involves yet another complex campaign , this one to limit the spread of powerful , low- or no - cost computer programs that allow users to protect their electronic messages from snooping .The F.B.I. , actively supported by the National Security Agency and the White House , has been a leader in a broad government effort to limit the sale of advanced encryption programs overseas and in the development of specially coded programs to allow the bureau to read secret messages .In Congressional testimony and speeches , F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh has said he is considering asking Congress to pass a law prohibiting the sale or use of encryption programs that do not include a \" trap door \" for the government .Another development that has worked to expand the F.B.I.

Edgar Hoover the power to monitor all telecommunications traffic in and out of the United States .Three weeks after 9/11 , President Bush handed Robert Mueller an authority almost as strong .For twenty - nine months following Bush 's order , the FBI had tracked thousands of telephones and Internet addresses in the United States under the aegis of the National Security Agency .\" Every day , \" as Mueller said , the Bureau investigated \" e - mail threats from all around the world saying that this particular terrorist activity is going to occur in the United States .\" Now the director faced a task as daunting .He had to defy the president and the vice president of the United States , confront them in a showdown over secrecy and democracy , and challenge them in the name of the law .At least three separate global eavesdropping programs had been mining and assaying the electronic ether under the rubric of Stellar Wind .At least two of them violated the Constitution 's protections against warrantless searches and seizures .Mueller saw no evidence that the surveillances had saved a life , stopped an imminent attack , or discovered an al - Qaeda member in the United States .The number of people who knew the facts was exceedingly small , but it was growing .A handful of Justice Department lawyers and intelligence court judges thought the programs were unconstitutional and their power had to be controlled .They convinced James Comey , the newly appointed number- two man at the Justice Department .And Comey soon won a convert in Robert Mueller .On March 4 , Mueller and Comey agreed that the FBI could not continue to go along with the surveillance programs .The scope of the searches had to be altered to protect the rights of Americans .They thought Attorney General Ashcroft could not re- endorse Stellar Wind as it stood .Comey made his case to his boss in an hour- long argument at the Justice Department that day , and Ashcroft concurred .Comey was a persuasive advocate .One of the FBI 's favorite prosecutors , the grandson of an Irish police commissioner , he had worked with skill and intensity on terrorism cases as the United States attorney in Manhattan for two years after the al - Qaeda attacks .The trust vested in him that day showed that the awe- inspiring force of American national security rested on personal relationships as well as statutory powers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.87535"}
