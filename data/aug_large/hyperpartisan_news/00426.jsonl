McDonald , Raymond Chandler , and Robert B. Parker told morality tales .Most of the crimes in their novels arise from decent people 's moral failings rather than from the intrusion of an outside evil .Whiplash River is a comedy , cheerfully amoral and with a cast of lunatics , not sinners or monsters .Issues of right and wrong , good and evil are left out of the mix or pushed into the background by characters ' more immediate concerns , like \" How did I get myself into this mess and how am I going to get out of it . \" Characters are n't motivated by their vices so much as by their obsessions and manias .Troubles do n't come because of moral lapses but because human beings just have a natural tendency to goof up .Elmore Leonard is Berney 's obvious influence , but there 's more than a nod towards Carl Hiaasen here too .Berney 's humor , though , is n't as mordant or borderline sadistic as Leonard 's can be or as blackly farcical as Hiaasen 's .Actually , in its more screwball comedy , Whiplash River reminded me of Donald Westlake 's comic crime novels , particularly the Dortmunder series .Berney 's protagonist , Shake Bouchon , is not as smart as Dortmunder and he lacks Dortmunder 's instinct for self - preservation , but like Dortmunder he is , to paraphrase Westlake himself , a man upon whom the sun shines only when he needs complete darkness .Shake --- and as I hinted up top , Berney spends too much time in his first scene explaining how Shake came to be called Shake , and it turns out not to be an interesting or important story --- is having a bad week .His beachside restaurant in Belize is n't doing a landmark business .The boss of the local drug cartel who loaned Shake the money to open the place is not happy that Shake has fallen behind in his payments .An FBI agent has flown down from the States intent on coercing Shake into testifying against some Armenian mobsters Shake did a few jobs for back in California .And to top off his troubles , a ski - masked thug shows up during what passes for the dinner rush and tries to kill one of Shake 's few customers , shooting up the dining room in the process .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.12698"}
