{"text": "So the volume you see on ETFs will not have the proper volume levels for that specific commodity or index .More times than not it almost the opposite ... .My last reason for trading long term intraday futures charts is because the price of the underlying commodity or index moves true while the ETFs which try to shadow these commodities generate false breakouts and breakdowns on a regular basis .Gold finally broke down from the bearish rising wedge which it had been forming through late September until mid October .I know the majority of traders , investors , and financial newsletters have already positioned themselves either long or short the metal as they anticipate the next major move .I will agree that a large move either up or down is just around the corner but what sets me apart from others is the fact that I do n't bet my hard earned money when the odds are 50/50 .I do n't pick tops or bottoms ; rather I wait for a clean break out or low risk entry point .Only then will I take action .Until the blue box on the chart has been broken with some type of retest I will continue to observe and analyze the chart of gold .The past month crude oil trading has been very profitable for subscribers and me .We shorted crude oil using an inverse etf in September which moved over 20 % in our favour within a few trading sessions .And just last week we shorted it again for a 7.5 % move in less than 24 hours .Overall I am still bearish on oil but have moved to cash until I see another high probability setup unfolding .The recent price action in crude oil makes the odds about a 50/50 bet as to which way it will break next .This is why I have moved back to cash and pocketed the quick gain .This chart is not the SP500 futures contract .This is just the SPY ETF but what I wanted to show was how the market was showing mixed signals .The past couple weeks price has been broadening and this can be taken two different way ....... .More times than not it is seen as a bearish pattern and price generally falls afterwards .But in rare situations which I think we could be experiencing now this broadening price action can be very bullish , meaning much higher prices ahead .So I continue to observe and prepare for a possible trade setup .August until now ( October 24 ) the SP500 is down -3.7 % and Gold is up 1.1 % , Silver is down 20 % and oil is down -7.2 .Subscribers of my newsletter have pocketed over 38.5 % in total gains using my simple low risk ETF trading alerts .If Greece defaults and the European situation begins to spin out of control where will money flow ?It would not make sense for market participants to buy Euro 's during a default regardless of whether the default it structured or not .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "27.794052"}

{"text": "We are of a view that the precious metals sector is forming a bottom .Such pullbacks are healthy as they indicate gold has much , much farther to go .Corrections in a bull market are inevitable as death and taxes .Markets never go up in a straight line .By the time gold put in its most recent high on August 22 after its parabolic rise during August , it had logged a stunning 44 % appreciation in calendar year 2011 .And even after its recent fall , gold is still 22 % higher than it was on its 2011 low , which took place on January 27 .Does that mean that gold has further to fall , and that the tumble could be steep ?To see whether gold and mining stocks are a good investment in the short - term as well as in the long run , let 's move to the technical section of this essay .In the very long - term chart XAU moved sharply lower early in the week to a level below the long - term rising trend channel .The 38.2 % Fibonacci retracement level based on the 2008 - 2010 rally has been reached and this coincides with the 50-week moving average as well .With these two support lines in play , it seems that gold , silver and gold and silver mining stocks will likely rally .The XAU Index is now slightly above its rising support line and the recent breakout could be confirmed or invalidated in the days ahead .The bullish confirmation of the recent breakout appears more likely .In the long - term HUI Index chart , gold stocks are seen to have reached the lower target level we mentioned several weeks ago close to the 500 level .A quick reversal has seen the index move sharply higher and the upside target level appears to be around 580 .The previous bottom was also confirmed by RSI levels .The outlook appears bullish from here .The short - term GDX ETF chart shows similar price action this week .A few resistance lines are being approached at this time and the closest is around $ 57 .It appears that this initial resistance will probably be broken and a likely upside target level of $ 60.70 seems reasonable .Before summarizing , let 's take a look how miners performed relative to the yellow metal .In the GDX : GLD ratio chart ( if you 're reading this essay on our website , you can click this chart to enlarge it ) this week , we can see how the miners performed against gold .This week , the ratio touched and moved to the previous lows and quickly bounced back .In fact , we mentioned the 0.31 - 0.32 as the possible target for this ratio on Sep 16 , 2011 .It was not likely to be reached recently , however a decline to this particular level followed by a rebound is still not something overly surprising .The mining stocks have been on an extremely scary and volatile ride of late but their recent price action has not been a complete surprise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "29.43131"}

{"text": "Minyanville management and staff as well as contributing writers will not respond to emails or other communications requesting investment advice .Gold and Silver Trading Alert : Confirmation of a Breakdown .Briefly : In our opinion short speculative positions in silver ( half ) and mining stocks ( full ) are justified from the risk / reward perspective .Friday was generally a calm day in the precious metals market and for the currency indices .The initial moves higher ( in the early part of the session ) were mostly invalidated later on and overall not much changed at the first sight .On second look , the lack of rally confirmed the breakdown in mining stocks .Interestingly , we can summarize the above chart in the same way that we did previously , because the daily move that we saw on Friday did n't change anything overall : .Gold moved lower once again [ on Thursday , but basically it did n't do anything on Friday ] but still not low enough to break below the rising support line .Gold is still outperforming silver and mining stocks ( taking this month into account ) , but now the extent of the outperformance is much smaller .Still , with the situation in Ukraine still being tense , gold might hold up relatively well even if the rest of the precious metals sector declines .At this time we see that gold 's reaction to the events in Ukraine has been very limited .When markets do n't react to factors that should make them move in a certain direction , they will likely move in the opposite direction relatively soon .In this case , it seems that gold will move lower .The move below the rising support line ( marked in red ) could symbolize the start of another big downleg regardless of the geopolitical tensions .For now , the price of gold is already close to this support , but not yet below it .Silver declined more than 5 % last week .It moved below the rising support lines and closed there on Friday , which is a bearish indication .The situation in silver is oversold , but only on a short - term basis .Consequently , we could still see a corrective upswing here before the decline continues .Miners confirmed their breakdown , but there was no short - term breakdown in gold , so it 's not that clear whether the precious metals sector - including silver - will move lower immediately .It could be the case that miners while decline while metals will pause for a few more days .The GDX ETF closed below the rising support line and the 50 % Fibonacci retracement level for the third consecutive trading day and the breakdown is now complete .If we had n't mentioned the extra short position in miners previouly , we would suggest it today .Please note that the small move up that we saw in the past 2 trading days materialized on low volume after a huge - volume decline .This suggests that the real move is down and that miners simply took a breather .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "34.52576"}
{"text": "On the above chart , we have a bullish sign - a move above the previous January high that happened on significant volume .Such action is quite likely to be followed by another daily upswing ( it does n't have to be significant ) .However , this seems to be the end of positive news .The move did n't take gold above the declining medium - term resistance line ( black line ) , and neither did it result in a breakout above the declining short - term resistance line ( red , dashed line ) .Taking the Dow ( INDEXDJX : .DJI ) -to - gold ratio into account , we see a post - breakout correction .It 's worth noting that the correction has begun sort of \" by itself \" - without reaching any significant resistance line .This makes it more likely that the move is just a correction and not a real decline in the ratio ( meaning a rally in gold ) .Moving on to the silver chart , we see something much less bullish .Click to enlarge .Silver moved significantly lower early last week and the situation did n't really improve over the rest of the week .Silver moved only slightly higher , and it was still down $ 0.31 for the week .The trend clearly remains down as there was no breakout above both rising long - term support / resistance lines .Gold miners moved higher recently , but not to the extent that would suggest the medium - term trend is already up .Yes , we saw a very small ( ! ) move above the declining resistance line , but just as it was the case with gold , we would need to see a confirmation of this move .This is particularly the case because we saw something similar right before the final part of the plunge in 2008 .History repeats itself to some degree , and the current decline is , in my opinion , most similar to the only other major decline that we saw since the beginning of this bull market .Back then there was one major correction within the decline ( we saw one in mid-2013 ) and then one small one .We have a small breakout right now .So , how bullish is it , really ?Mildly bullish is our best answer at this time .They corrected to the first of the classic Fibonacci retracement levels , the 38.2 % retracement , and declined afterwards ( there was an intra - day breakout last Thursday , but the move did n't hold and silver miners closed below the retracement ) .This means that the trend remains down and all that we saw was a correction .The declining resistance lines ( for silver stocks , and for their ratio to silver , which you can see in the lower part of the chart ) were not broken , and the trend remains down also from this perspective .There is no doubt that a significant , counter - trend daily slide in the USD Index was one of the factors contributing to higher precious metals prices last Thursday .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "34.635056"}

{"text": "After about three weeks of currency declines , last week brought the breakout and a start of a rally .The strengthening of the US dollar was a strong blow not only to the currencies , but also to commodity markets .After Ben Bernanke 's comments , pessimism transpired to the precious metals markets , and we saw some of the biggest swings in this sector .The sell - off in precious metals pushed gold and silver to lower levels ; last week they hit new 2013 lows , but it seems that they have n't found the bottom quite yet .On Friday , gold fell below its technical support around $ 1,285 - 1,308 per ounce .The decrease in the yellow metal triggered a plunge in silver .The white metal has been beaten in the recent months even worse than gold , and on Friday morning , its price accordingly went down to the lowest level since September 2010 .Could these events trigger a more profound correction in mining stocks ?It 's said that a picture is worth a thousand words .So let 's take a look at some charts below and try to come up with a thousand words to describe what we see .First , I think it would be interesting to revisit the silver - to - gold ratio to see how the two are valued relative to each other .Perhaps this will provide some clues .Click to enlarge When you take a look at this chart , you can ask a simple question : Is the bottom already in ?Several weeks ago , I mentioned the silver - gold ratio as one of the key things to look at when making the call : .I have previously discussed how the final bottom for the white metal is often preceded by a big underperformance of silver to gold .This is yet to be seen , so lower prices are likely still in the cards for the white metal , and the rest of the sector as well .There 's been no sharp drop so far , so the bottom is likely still ahead of us .If that 's the case and the entire precious metals sector is about to move lower , how low can mining stocks go ?Let 's take a look at two of the most followed commodity stock indices : the Philadelphia Gold / Silver XAU Index ( INDEXNASDAQ : XAU ) and the AMEX Gold Bugs HUI Index ( INDEXNYSEGIS : HUI ) .The XAU Index is above our initial target ( 84 ) for this decline ( or at least it was at the moment of creating the above chart ) .As you know this target level was created from the rising support line based on the late 2000 and 2008 lows .However , it seems that we could see a move even below that level and a local bottom will probably form slightly above 80 .This is the range that likely needs to be reached before the declines in the mining stocks and the precious metals sector come to a close .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "35.74618"}

{"text": "Finally , when calculating the number of shares , we always use the current market value of our portfolio .If we started with a $ 1,000,000 portfolio and lost $ 15,000 on our first trade , we would use the new market value of $ 985,000 to calculate the number of shares for our next trade .Since position sizes are calculated as a percentage of total capital , the dollar amount of our positions would increase if our capital grew .If we suffered a series of losses , the dollar amount of our future positions would decrease accordingly .Calculating Position Size for Futures .Traders often get confused when thinking about futures contracts - due to margin requirements , multipliers , and other factors .Futures contracts represent the agreement to transact a specific quantity of the underlying asset at a specific time in the future .When purchasing ( or selling ) a futures contract , you do not need to deposit the full value of the contract up front .Instead , the buyer and seller are both required to make a margin or good faith deposit , to guarantee that they can make good on their future obligations under the contract .Margin requirements are based on the volatility of the underlying contract , but are typically between 10 % and 15 % of the market value of the contract .Fortunately , the margin requirements do not affect the calculation of position size .Let 's look at a specific example of how to use our formula to calculate the maximum position size for the e - mini S&P 500 ( ES ) futures contract .Again , assume that our current portfolio value is $ 1.0 Million .However , instead of buying the SPY , we would like to buy the ES contract , which is trading at a current price of $ 1,391.50 .As mentioned earlier , each futures contract has a multiplier .The multiplier for the ES contract is 50 , which means that the market value of each contract equals 50 times the current price .In this case , the market value of a single ES contract would be $ 69,575 ( 50 x $ 1,391.50 ) .Now we can calculate the position size for our ES trade using formula # 2 above .The number of contracts equals the position size divided by the current market value of each contract ( $ 150,000 / $ 69,575 ) , which equals 2.15 ES contracts .We can only trade an integer number of contracts and we always round down to avoid exceeding the desired total capital at risk .In this case , we would purchase 2 e - mini S&P 500 ( ES ) contracts at a price of $ 1,391.50 .To find the stop level for the ES trade , we calculate the value 10 % below the purchase price ( $ 1,391.50 x 0.90 ) and round up to the nearest $ 0.25 ( the minimum price increment in the ES contract is $ 0.25 ) .The resulting stop level would be $ 1,252.50 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "37.563232"}
{"text": "We see that the broad market has yet to break out above its 2007 high .The Dow Jones Industrials did so , but the S&P 500 have not , so there is no confirmation of a breakout here .This creates a particularly interesting situation .It seems that the S&P 500 could rally further as their major resistance line has not yet been reached .The Dow Industrials could also rally further since they have already broken out above the resistance level of the 2007 highs .A pause , however , would be likely once the S&P 500 reached their 2007 high .Our best guess at this time is that the S&P 500 will likely consolidate below the 2007 top , and the Dow Industrials ' consolidation will probably take the form of a post - breakout breather .The RSI suggests an overbought situation , so some consolidation is expected at this time .We expect the rally to continue after a few weeks of consolidation .We will be more certain of a medium - term rally after the breakout is also seen in the S&P 500 .Such a development appears quite likely at the moment .Let 's now move on to intermarket correlations to see how the situation in currencies and stocks could influence gold and silver .The Correlation Matrix is a tool , which we have developed to analyze the impact of the currency markets and the general stock market upon the precious metals sector .We have two things , which we wish to comment on today .First , the link between the USD Index and gold is negative for the short and medium term .In daily price moves , however , it seems that what happens in the USD Index has been rather irrelevant .Gold and the precious metals have simply refused to move lower when the dollar moved higher .Our second point is the negative correlation between the precious metals and the general stock market .The link has not been as strong in the last few days , as gold and the precious metals have not declined , although stock prices were rising .When a correction is seen in the general stock market or a period of consolidation begins , the precious metals sector could respond with higher prices .At this time it seems that the precious metals are anti - assets , just as gold is a hedge against turmoil in the stock and currency markets .As investors become more optimistic about these markets , they sell their gold .It does not mean that in the long run gold can not rally along with stocks .For instance , both are fueled by low interest rates and quantitative easing .This tells us that a short - term consolidation in the stock market could easily have a positive impact on gold .Summing up , we could see additional short - term strengths in the USD Index along with weakness in the Euro Index .Neither will probably move very much , and there may be little to no negative impact to gold and the rest of the precious metals sector .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "37.69178"}

{"text": "\" Taking into account the current situation in the yellow metal , the above price targets remain valid .Let 's take a look at the chart featuring gold 's price from the non - USD perspective .From the non - USD perspective , gold simply moved back to the previously broken support line and verified it as resistance .There was only an intra - week move above it , but the price is already back below the line , and it seems that gold will close the week below it as well .Please note that in the final part of 2013 , we also saw one intra - week move back above this line , and that move was even more significant than what we saw this week .It too did n't invalidate the breakdown .In fact , it was followed by a significant downswing .We can expect the situation to be quite similar shortly , if gold does indeed rally .The move higher could be temporary , and unless we have a weekly close above the rising support line ( dashed line , currently close to 46 ) , we will not have any bullish implications whatsoever .Even if we see some strength , the ratio would have to move above $ 48 ( where the upper declining resistance line is currently located ) in order for the situation to become bullish .Consequently , some short - term strength is clearly possible , but my firm does n't think that the medium - term downtrend will be invalidated .Having discussed the current situation in gold , let 's take a look at the long - term chart for silver .Click to enlarge .It is often said that history repeats itself ( or that it rhymes ) , and it surely applies when we look at silver 's recent performance .At the end of December 2013 , silver moved temporarily back above the rising support / resistance line , but did n't manage to hold this level .The white metal gave up the gains and dropped below both long - term support / resistance lines , which triggered further deterioration .This week , the white metal made another attempt to move back above the resistance lines , but failed to move above the upper of them , and ultimately , the breakdown below these lines was not invalidated .The next downside target is the previous 2013 low , slightly above the $ 18 level .Once we see silver below it , the next ( and probably final ) stop will likely be close to $ 16 .Overall , the trend remains down .Summing up , looking at the current situation in gold and silver , we see that the medium - term trends remain down and the outlook for both remains bearish .However , on a short - term basis , we can expect to see a temporary move higher .In the case of gold , it does n't seem that the yellow metal will move above $ 1,250 , and even if that happened , it would not be likely to move above $ 1,285 and change the medium - term trend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "37.878357"}

{"text": "Feb Market Overview .The complexity and uniqueness of the gold market make people differ in their opinions about it .Some say that the precious metals are under the thumb of central bankers , while others blame big banks and their use of derivatives ( ' naked ' shorts ) and high - frequency trading for the declines in the price of gold .There are also worries about the discrepancy between paper gold and physical gold , the fairness of London trading , declining inventories at Comex and leasing of gold by central banks .We will try to examine these views so investors have a better understanding of the gold market and its true drivers .Stay Connected .Since the US shutdown began , gold has been trading in a tight range between $ 1,277 and $ 1,330 per ounce .Although investors have believed that worries over the debt ceiling would be only short - lived , it seems that each day that passed without an agreement tested their nerves .On Thursday , President Barack Obama agreed to consider a proposal from Republican lawmakers to avert a historic debt default .US House of Representatives Republicans plan to offer Obama a short - term increase in the federal debt limit if he agrees to negotiate with Republicans on certain matters , including funding to reopen the government .These circumstances present a potential breakthrough in the standoff that has led to a 10-day partial US government shutdown .From today 's point of view , it seems that -- thanks to this development -- the yellow metal lost an important support .Please note that gold is considered to be a hedge against political and economic uncertainty by some investors who purchase the metal when such fears run high ( and who then reduce their holdings in favor of riskier assets like equities when these concerns fade ) .Therefore , yesterday , gold fell and touched a one - and - a - half - week low of $ 1,282 as investors cut back holdings of the haven asset .This is gold 's lowest price since the first day of the partial government shutdown .Earlier today , we saw a small pullback to $ 1,294 , however , gold is still heading for a weekly decline .Please note that if the yellow metal closes today below $ 1,282 , it will be its sixth decline in seven weeks , which will extend the year 's losses to 23 % .In short , in our view , it 's highly likely that the debt ceiling will be increased and that the talks about it are really smoke and mirrors , aimed at convincing voters that the deal was n't coined already a long time ago .In our view , the debt ceiling will be increased because other options are too costly and much harder to put into place politically .Will an increase in the debt ceiling end the decline in the gold market ?Not likely ; gold has already declined since the possible increase was mentioned .Besides , we already researched this topic over two years ago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.671627"}

{"text": "Now , let 's have a look at the HUI Index .The chart below expresses a simplicity that betrays potential information on where this market may ultimately be heading .Click to enlarge Last week gold mining stocks continued their decline .Although investors have been selling their shares , fear remains in control .However , this may not last much longer .As mentioned above it seems that miners might move even below the initial target of 84 for the XAU Index .In this case , it is the HUI Index that enables us to create a better price target .There is a major support zone drawn on the chart which is a worst case scenario .The red ellipse on the above chart includes both important support levels - the 61.8 % Fibonacci retracement level and the 2008 low .There 's one more thing that was n't marked on the chart , and that is the price gap close to the 300 level ( the gap was formed in April ) .Such a price gap sometimes indicates that at the time when its formed , the market is halfway done rallying or ( in this case ) declining .Taking this analogy provides us with a target in the marked area as well .Our final chart today is the gold stocks - to - gold ratio , which is one of the more interesting ratios that exists in the precious metals market .The above chart provides a very bearish picture .We see that the decline continues and that the ratio is quite far from its target - the 2000 low .Please note that the trading channel and the next horizontal support intersect at a point much lower than where this ratio is today .As I wrote over a month ago on May 17 , 2013 : .The ratio has already broken below the previous late 2008 major low ....This is a major breakdown and it was confirmed .The implication is that the trend is still down .With the trend being down and accelerating and the recent breakdown being confirmed , there is a good possibility that the miners will decline significantly once again .The ratio might move to its target level -- the 2000 low -- close to the 0.135 level , which is a quite clear forecast as far as direction of the next move is concerned .Summing up , the outlook for mining stocks remains bearish , and the correction is likely still not over .There may be many obvious and not - so - obvious reasons for this recent underperformance of the precious metals sector , but the charts are quite clear .In my view it does not seem that the final bottom for mining stocks is in -- at least not based on last week 's closing prices .The information on this website solely reflects the analysis of or opinion about the performance of securities and financial markets by the writers whose articles appear on the site .The views expressed by the writers are not necessarily the views of Minyanville Media , Inc. or members of its management .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "44.509064"}

{"text": "The second half of the previous week brought interesting pieces of economic data and disturbing geopolitical news .On Wednesday , weekly inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) showed that crude oil inventories declined in line with forecasts .Traders had expected inventories to decline by 1.5 million barrels , while the actual decline came in slightly lower - at 1.428 million barrels .Taking into account another weekly inventory decline , current crude supplies are at their lowest level since Aug. 31 last year .At the end of the previous week , the combination of positive global economic data , which improved the outlook for oil consumption , and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East fueled oil prices .Light crude extended Thursday 's gains and climbed above $ 106 per barrel on an intraday basis .According to Reuters , manufacturing data for the two largest oil consumers , the U.S. and China , showed that both nations were regaining momentum .U.S. PMI data showed that the nation 's manufacturing activity rose at its fastest pace in five months .In China , a PMI reading of 50.1 for August was a four month high and a huge jump from last month 's disappointing 47.7 .As we all know , the markets have been speculating for months now that the Fed might trim its stimulus by September and it seems that recent positive economic data have raised such fears .Keep in mind that any reduction in quantitative easing will cut the flow of cheap central bank money that has boosted market liquidity and bolstered riskier markets like commodities .Taking this into account , investors are probably asking the same questions : what impact have these circumstances had on the light crude 's chart ?Have they changed the outlook for oil ?Where are the nearest support zones and resistance levels ?Can oil climb above $ 110 in the near term ?Or maybe the oil bears will return and trigger a deeper correction ?To have a more complete picture of the current situation in the oil market , we take a look at the charts from different time perspectives .On the above chart , we see that in June the price of light crude increased above the long - term declining resistance line based on the July 2008 and the May 2011 highs ( bold red line ) .In the following month light crude continued its rally and climbed above the next resistance line based on the September 2012 and March 2013 highs ( the upper black line ) .Since then , light crude remains above both previously - broken resistance lines and the breakout has n't been invalidated .When we take a closer look at this chart , we see that the black declining resistance line is also the upper line of a large triangle .If the oil bulls do not fail , the rally will likely be continued .From this perspective the picture is bullish .Now , let 's zoom in on our picture of the oil market and see the weekly chart .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.684242"}

{"text": "This essay is based on the Premium Update posted September 19th , 2009 .This week the price of gold hovered above the $ 1000 level and managed to close above this important level , a very significant and optimistic development for anyone interested in the precious metals sector .But before we launch into euphoria and speed away , now might be a good time to look back into our rearview mirror .While we 're looking back , here is some interesting research to put things into historical perspective .Back in November , a researcher by the name of James Bianco crunched the numbers adjusted them to inflation and discovered that the government bailout cost more than -are you ready for this ? - the Marshall Plan , the Louisiana Purchase , the race to the moon , the S&L crises , the Korean War , The New Deal , the invasion of Iraq , the Vietnam War and NASA combined .The only single American event in history that even comes close to matching the cost of the credit crisis ( $ 4.6 trillion ) is World War II : Original Cost : $ 288 billion , Inflation Adjusted Cost : $ 3.6 trillion .Keeping in mind that inflation is the increase in the prices of goods caused by the changes in the money supply , expecting high inflation in the coming months and years looks like a sure bet .Now let 's take a look at how gold - generally known as the best inflation hedge - has fared in this turbulent year .On September 19th , a year ago , the price of gold was $ 865 .Over the past year gold proved to be an excellent hedge at times of economic distress , and bounced with a vengeance after dropping , along with virtually every other asset , due to margin calls .Contrary to the general stock market , gold is now much higher ( and about to reach new highs ) than it was back then .This fact is encouraging by itself .Combining it with positive fundamentals provides us with an even more bullish outlook .The only thing the PMs need to move substantially higher is a very favorable technical juncture .Are we there ?From the long - term point of view , gold is in a favorable situation , as it closed above the $ 1000 level during the last 4 trading days , confirming the move above that barrier .It has n't yet pierced through the 2008 high , but I believe it 's just a question of time , and in the not too distant future , before we see the yellow metal break higher .The RSI Indicator was just at the overbought levels and is still near 70 , which in the past was an efficient tool in timing local tops , so the odds of a decline from here are rather high .Volume has been declining after price moved sharply higher , generally a sign that a rally 's end is near .In this case I think a consolidation is the most likely outcome .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.92756"}

{"text": "One of the biggest challenges many traders face is avoiding \" Slice - O - Matic \" markets .What is a \" Slice - O - Matic \" market ?Well , it 's a market that lacks any real direction .We can call these markets \" Slice - O - Matic \" markets as they cut trader 's equity into ever smaller pieces .For the past seven days , the S&P 500 has not closed in any one direction from more than one day .This is the choppy scenario that many traders would like to avoid .So how is that done ?One of the simplest ways that I know is to use our Trade Triangle technology .The major Trade Triangle to watch trading stocks is the monthly Trade Triangle , as this determines the trend .We use the weekly Trade Triangles for timing purposes .Let me give you an example , if the last monthly Trade Triangle is green , this indicates the major trend is up for that stock .You would then use the initial monthly Trade Triangle as an entry point and the weekly red Trade Triangle as an exit point .You would only reenter a long position if and when a green weekly Trade Triangle reappeared , providing the monthly green Triangle is still in place .You would again use the next weekly red Trade Triangle as an exit point .The reverse is true if a red monthly Trade Triangle shows that the trend is down .You would then use the weekly green Trade Triangles for covering short positions and the weekly red Trade Triangles for reentering short positions .When you have two opposing Trade Triangles , like the red monthly Triangle and green weekly Triangle in the S&P 500 , it indicates that you should be on the sidelines and in cash .You would be amazed at just how well this simple formula works in the stock market .So there you have it , a simple , easy way to protect your equity and avoid \" Slice - O - Matic \" markets .Let 's check the trend analysis for the S&P 500 INDEX .The market action in the S&P 500 index continues to be very choppy and we expect that to continue in the near term .The long term monthly Trade Triangle is negative on this market and yesterday 's action did not alter that .With a Chart Analysis Score of + 70 , we are stuck in a trading range waiting for some news to shake us out of the doldrums .Intermediate traders should be on the sidelines waiting for a new Trade Triangle signal .Long term traders should either be in cash or continue to hold short positions in this index .Back on October 3 rd I wrote a public article forecasting a major market bottom at around 1088 on the SP 500 index .I surmised we were about to complete a 5 wave move to the downside that commenced with the Bin Laden highs of 1370 in early May of this year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.338512"}

{"text": "It makes sense that big corrections would take longer to reach new highs than small ones , but I wanted to confirm that assumption with the data .I also wanted to determine if there were any patterns in past recoveries that would give us some clues that we can apply to today .Gold set a record on September 5 at $ 1,895 an ounce ( London PM Fix ) and to date has fallen as low as $ 1,531 ( December 29 ) , a decline of 19.2 % .In order to determine how long it might take to breach $ 1,895 again , I measured how long it took new highs to be mounted after big corrections in the past .The following chart details three large corrections since 2001 , and calculates how many weeks it took the gold price to a ) breach the old high , and b ) stay above that level .As you can see , it took a significant amount of time for gold to forge new highs after big selloffs .And yes , the bigger the correction , the longer it took .In 2006 , after a total fall of 22.6 % , it took a year and four months for gold to surpass its old high .After the 2008 meltdown , it was a year and six months later before gold hit a new record .Our recent correction more closely resembles the one in 2003 .After a 16.2 % drop , gold matched the old high seven months later .It took another two months to stay above it .So when do we reach a new high in the gold price ?Let 's apply the same ratio from the 2003 correction and recovery : If it took 29 weeks and four days to reach a new high after a 16.2 % correction , a 19.2 % pullback would take 35 weeks and 0 days .That works out to Monday , May 7 , 2012 .An exact date is pure conjecture , of course .On one hand , gold could drop below the $ 1,531 low if the need for cash and liquidity forces large investors to resume selling .On the other hand , Europe and/or the US could resume money printing on a large scale and send gold soaring overnight .The point of the data is that it signals we should n't be too surprised if we do n't hit $ 1,900 for another four months yet .And if it takes another two months or so to stay above it .Think that 's too long ?There are some important reasons to not let it discourage you ... .Once gold breaches its old high , you 'll probably never be able to buy it at current prices again .That 's a rather obvious statement , but let it sink in .Buying now at $ 1,600 and then watching the price fall to , say , $ 1,500 , would n't be fun - but it 'll probably hit $ 2,000 or higher before the year 's over , never to visit the $ 1,600s again this cycle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.63696"}

{"text": "Wikipedia lists the following definition for volatility term structure : . \" Volatility term structures list the relationship between implied volatilities and time to expiration .The term structures provide another method for traders to gauge cheap or expensive options .\" As can be seen above , the forward Volatility Term Structure indicates that volatility is expected to go higher in the future .This is not all that uncommon , but I think what is more important is the rate of change in the near term .When we look at this chart , the term structure indicates that Volatility levels roughly 4 months out ( March 2013 ) are nearly 13 % higher than they are today .By June of 2013 , volatility 's rate of change is well over 20 % higher than it is today .It is important to understand that volatility does not necessarily mean risk .Volatility typically increases when equity prices are falling , however volatility levels can rise for a variety of reasons .Uncertainty about the outcome of an event like hitting the debt ceiling could push volatility levels higher without sending equity prices sharply lower .The point is the term structure just provides clues as it is not the holy grail about looking in the future .What the Volatility term structure does tell us is that the marketplace expects a significant increase in overall volatility in the next 3 - 6 months .What I think the Volatility Term Structure is conveying presently is that decisions regarding the fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling will impact market prices , However the real impact may not be felt until later in the 1 st or 2 nd Quarters of 2013 .Most economists believe that if we do go over the fiscal cliff and taxes go up for everyone that the U.S. economy will be in recession within 6 - 9 months .Clearly as shown above , the Volatility Term Structure likely agrees with the economists assessments and the economic conditions in the next 6 to 7 months could possibly turn for the worse .All we can hope for is that the politicians can compromise on a plan that will remove uncertainty from the marketplace without compromising the economy .Something tells me that is not likely to happen , but here is to hoping that I 'm wrong !This material should not be considered investment advice .J.W.

{"text": "Diagonal Spread Strategy Details Our analysts create simulated covered calls by selling a short - term call that will expire in roughly two months while simultaneously buying a long - term call at a lower strike price that will expire in 6 - 18 months .The goal for these trades is to generate a 20%+ annualized return ( for comparison purposes ) .Each trade in this portfolio assumes 10 options contract on each side of the trade .The strike price of these sold calls for the diagonal trades is usually higher than the strike price for corresponding sold call in the covered call , which is one of the reasons this strategy has the slightly higher risk of the two .Covered Call Ideal Result In the best case - scenario , our calls expire in - the - money , then we are assigned and deliver the stock at expiration .There is no further action required to close the position and based on the way we set up the trades , there is no way we can lose .If the stock has a dividend , we will collect those as long as we hold the stock position .Diagonal Spread Ideal Result In the best case - scenario , our sold calls are in - the - money during the week before expiration .If that is true , then our analysts will often be able to exit the position for a larger profit than our original target .To do this , we will buy back our sold calls and sell our bought long - term call for a total credit .When we exit these trades early , the credit will almost always be larger than the difference between the two strike prices of our options .If there is no reasonable exit price , but the stock is still above our sold call 's strike price , then automatically we will be assigned on our sold call at expiration .If we then exercise the bought call , we are assured of a credit equal to the difference between strike prices .Covered Call Other Potential Results If the stock is below the strike price of our sold call at expiration , then the call will expire worthless and disappear , but we will keep the stock .At this point , our analysts have a few choices .Typically we will hold onto the stock , sell another call to lower our amount at risk ( a follow - on trade ) , and keep collecting any dividends .Potentially , a covered call position could go on forever if the calls never expire in - the - money .The other plan of action would be to sell the stock at market price and close the position fully .If the stock is above our break - even point , we can still make a profit this way .If the stock has had some material bad news and we do n't think it is likely to recover , then we will probably sell the stock and take our losses .Diagonal Spread Other Potential Results If the underlying stock is below our sold call 's strike price at expiration , then that call will expire worthless .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.24736"}

{"text": "Investing in Commodities Using ETFs .Commodity investing seems to be all the rage these days .Before adding commodities to your investment portfolio , you should answer two questions .First , why invest in commodities ?Second , what is the best way to invest in them ?What is a commodity ?A commodity is simply a good or service that is not readily distinguishable from another of its type .For example , gold is a commodity .One ounce of gold is pretty much like every other ounce of gold ; the same with a gallon of gasoline , a barrel of oil , a pound of copper or a pound of steak .Many of the things we buy , use , consume and wear in our daily lives are commodities or are derived from them .Cotton is used to make the clothes we wear .Gasoline fuels our cars .Coal and natural gas heat and cool our homes .Just as you can buy and own a share of stock or a bond , you can also buy a commodity .Commodities do not pay a dividend or pay interest , so the return on your investment is solely dependent on the change in the price of that commodity .Since they are commodities , their price is determined by the balance of supply and demand .If more people demand a commodity at a price than can , or will , supply it at that price , then the price of that commodity will rise , and vice versa .Why invest in commodities at all ?There are three broad reasons : . 1 ) Diversification - Commodities are a separate asset class .An asset class is simply an asset that moves in price differently than another asset .Though the price of commodities can be volatile and risky , they often perform differently from stocks and bonds .Because they perform differently , combining commodities into a portfolio of stocks and bonds will likely lower the volatility and risk of your overall portfolio and deliver better risk - adjusted returns over time .Someone called diversification the only free lunch in investing .Adding commodities to your portfolio will typically increase its diversification . 2 ) Hedging - Since your returns from owning commodities depend on the change in the price of that commodity , commodities make good inflation hedges .As inflation drives up prices , the prices of commodities also increase , which increases the value of your investment .It is important to note that not all commodities respond the same way to inflation , so this hedge is best done with a basket of various commodities .While commodities are good inflation hedges , they are also hedges against currency devaluation .If the US dollar weakens against other currencies , commodities from other countries will increase in price in terms of US dollars .For example , if the US dollar weakens against the Mexican peso by 10 % , then Mexicans will demand roughly 10 % more US dollars for a barrel of oil .In this way , owning commodities is a form of insurance for if the US dollar weakens against other currencies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.997993"}

{"text": "Due to the holiday season , many traders take vacations and leave their trading desks .Because traders are largely absent , volume levels start to decline as the holiday season approaches .Typically volume levels do not normalize until January of the new year .Low volume levels typically synch up with low volatility levels .When those two forces align together the bulls will almost always have the upper hand .Is it any wonder that this time of year the financial media begins discussing a \" Santa Claus rally \" ?Of course not , but Santa Claus is really just light volume levels and low volatility levels in this case .Recently volatility has been pretty choppy , but the Volatility Index is not showing considerable fear regarding the fiscal cliff in the near term .In fact , the VIX is trading in the middle of its recent range as shown below .At first glance , this chart does not appear to be warning us about fear at the moment .However , certain aspects of the Volatility Index ( VIX ) are largely unknown to the retail investor .The VIX is a guide for volatility in the present , but it does a poor job of projecting future volatility .Simply looking at the VIX 's current price is not the appropriate way to gauge market volatility expectations in the future .The Volatility Term Structure is a better way of understanding what the Volatility Index is saying about the future .Wikipedia lists the following definition for volatility term structure : . \" Volatility term structures list the relationship between implied volatilities and time to expiration .The term structures provide another method for traders to gauge cheap or expensive options .\" As can be seen above , the forward Volatility Term Structure indicates that volatility is expected to go higher in the future .This is not all that uncommon , but I think what is more important is the rate of change in the near term .When we look at this chart , the term structure indicates that Volatility levels roughly 4 months out ( March 2013 ) are nearly 13 % higher than they are today .By June of 2013 , volatility 's rate of change is well over 20 % higher than it is today .It is important to understand that volatility does not necessarily mean risk .Volatility typically increases when equity prices are falling , however volatility levels can rise for a variety of reasons .Uncertainty about the outcome of an event like hitting the debt ceiling could push volatility levels higher without sending equity prices sharply lower .The point is the term structure just provides clues as it is not the holy grail about looking in the future .What the Volatility term structure does tell us is that the marketplace expects a significant increase in overall volatility in the next 3 - 6 months .What I think the Volatility Term Structure is conveying presently is that decisions regarding the fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling will impact market prices , However the real impact may not be felt until later in the 1 st or 2 nd Quarters of 2013 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.204983"}

Does n't this seem like a bearish flag : Slow grind higher in miners on low volume after big declines .What should we be looking for if this is actually the bottom ?Should the move up be bigger and on higher volume ?I do n't know anything , just wondering .Every time there seems to be a break after a big decline , the decline returns with a vengeance .How is this different ?A : Generally yes , we would like to see a strong rally on strong volume to be more confident that the final bottom is behind us .The price pattern in mining stocks does look like a bearish flag pattern that would result in the continuation of the decline .However , we will not know until the miners break out either above the flag or below it .The key point here is that other markets - gold , silver , platinum - suggest higher prices in our view , and the SP gold indicators suggest higher prices as well .The situation in the USD Index is also favorable .As no market moves totally on its own , we take more of them into account , and in this case the results are bullish .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.850548"}

{"text": "Right now , I have to keep telling myself that a turn is coming and it will be strong .AND it has not started yet and I must be patient and wait .This is definitely one of the hardest things for me to do .\" Waiting \" is not my nature as I always feel like I will be missing something .As a teacher of mine once said : Trades are like busses .There 's another one coming around the corner .So do n't jump the gun and move back into the market when a turn is evident .I received a question about the differences between triangles and wedges , so I just wanted to write a quick post about it .Much like symmetrical triangles , wedges are generally larger chart patterns that are characterized by two converging lines .But unlike the lines of a symmetrical triangle , which slope in opposite directions , the two sides of a wedge will both slope in the SAME direction ( up or down ) at different angles .Therefore , a rising wedge will have two converging sides that both slope up , while a falling wedge will have two converging sides that both slope down .Falling wedges after uptrends are usually considered bullish continuation patterns , while rising wedges after downtrends are usually considered bearish continuation patterns .Other wedge scenarios are generally taken on a case - by - case basis .Trading signals , like with triangles , are triggered on the breakout or breakdown of the wedge .In the Forex market , wedges occur on a relatively frequent basis .James Chen 's description should suffice to alert the reader that we are facing a triangular formation which is however not classified as such .As additional identification guidelines we can add that the support and resistance lines shall always have an inclination and not be parallel to the time axis .Remember : if one of the lines is horizontal , then you are seeing a triangle .In case of a wedge the lines must eventually intersect but note that this pattern 's main characteristic is the elongated shape - more than any of the previous mentioned patterns .Another characteristic is the number of contact points which shall be also higher than two because of the relatively longer lifetime of the formation .Be skeptical if there are only few contact points at the support and resistance lines .Ideally , the wedge has to show a well distributed price action inside its borders .This , by the way , is something you want to check in all formations : too much \" white space \" , literally space where the price did not go through on the chart , is not a good sign .Usually prices break out of the wedge at about two - thirds of the length of the formation - from the start to the eventual apex , the apex being the point were both lines meet .They are quite common , not so easy to find , and can occur at any time during the trend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.458725"}

{"text": "The cognitive hallmark of depression is negativity .In an auto - immune disease , the body 's immune system turns against the body itself , treating the body as a foreign invader .Depression is a kind of emotional immune system , in which we expel goals that are not appropriate or attainable .Depression becomes an auto - immune problem when we turn against entirely proper values and lose our drive to engage in activities that would sustain us .Our negativity toward ourselves dampens our motivation and keeps us mired in problems .Brehm 's basic hypothesis is that emotions are motivationally regulating : they impel us toward valued ends and keep us from pursuing unavailable ideals .If we look at emotions that way , then we can see that boredom and loss of interest are mild forms of depressive emotion .These are adaptive , and they may be providing us with valuable information about our values and their realization in the present .Other times , however , depressive emotions can interfere with performance in trading -- and life .In my next post , we 'll take a look at how we might identify when depressive feelings are problematic and how we can shift out of those when we need to .If you take a look at this post , you 'll see my research pertaining to the Cumulative Demand / Supply Index .To quickly recapitulate , Demand is a proprietary measure of the number of NYSE , NASDAQ , and ASE closing above the volatility envelopes surrounding their moving averages .Supply is a measure of the number of stocks closing below their envelopes .When I subtract Supply from Demand and keep a cumulative total , that provides an excellent overbought / oversold indicator .The research referenced above suggests that returns have been subnormal when the cumulative measure is significantly above its 200-day moving average .Returns have been superior when the cumulative index is well below its moving average .As noted in that earlier post , returns have been particularly weak when we 've seen dwindling new highs / lows in the face of an overbought cumulative index .On Tuesday , the index hit its first overbought level since February 13th and February 1st before that .Both of those prior occasions led to selloffs .I notice that new 20-day lows fell on Wednesday from Tuesday 's level .Notice that growth has been underperforming value in the U.S. ( observe recent weakness among such stocks as GOOG and AAPL ) , but not in Europe , Australasia , and the Far East .Returns are negative all around , but while many economies are dealing with double - digit inflation rates , recession seems to be the larger concern in the U.S.--recent commodity spikes notwithstanding .Mr. Bernanke 's testimony to Congress later today will be important , given this backdrop .Interestingly , China ( FXI ) is down 12.31 % over that same period .Indeed , a chart of FXI does n't look so different from a chart of many U.S. growth issues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.17721"}
