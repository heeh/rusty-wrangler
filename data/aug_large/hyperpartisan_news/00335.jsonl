'I think we do .We have different routes of getting to the Almighty ' , Bush said . 'But I want you to understand , I want your listeners to understand , I do n't get to get decide who goes to heaven .The Almighty God decides who goes to heaven and I am on my personal walk ' , he said .\" Freemasons believe this spiritual lie , which is why President Bush can both take his oath of office on a Masonic King James Bible and publicly state that Islam is just another route to get to the Almighty in His Heaven ! CONCLUSION .For the second time , President Bush \" faces the obelisk \" as he takes his oath of office as President of the United States .More than ever , we are convinced that President George W. Bush is an Illuminist and not a Born Again Christian .Bush may take actions that are wildly popular amongst most Conservatives , but he assembled a staff of Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) and Skull & Bones members that is unequalled in any previous administration .He has carried out Illuminist plans regarding the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq , the pollution of the entire Middle East with Depleted Uranium munitions , the passage of draconian dictatorial laws , and the weakening of the entire structure of morality with his actions .Further , if we are as close to this planned World War III as we think we are , then Republican President Bush will be the president during this war that produces Antichrist .In this very End of the Age , where the final prophecies are poised to be fulfilled , we must not now become deceived .We must now be even more vigilant than ever .Christian author , Ralph Epperson , notes that , when the Illuminati wants domestic changes made , they cause a Democrat to be elected ; but when they want international changes made , they cause a Republican to be elected .Since this planned World War III , designed to produce Antichrist , is an international event , the Illuminati might have decided to cause George W.

{"text": "Thus , we are very , very concerned about the following facts surrounding George W. Bush 's Inauguration .Satanic symbolism abounded , delivering a message which is much more strongly than Bush 's words of Christianity .Let us examine the very strong Luciferian messages which can be gained from the Washington Monument obelisk and the fact that the President is facing it while taking his oath of office today .George W. Bush took his Inaugural oath today facing the obelisk .This picture to your left was taken as President Ronald Reagan took his Inaugural oath on January 20 , 1981 .Reagan startled the occult world by taking his oath of office from the West Wing of the Capitol , and not the East Wing as all his predecessors had done .When President Reagan decided to become the first U.S. President to take his oath from the West Wing of the Capitol , he faced the obelisk , as you can see .This fact meant that he was sending the strongest possible signal to fellow Illuminists the world over that , after 205 years of pursuing the goal of establishing the New World Order -- Kingdom of the Antichrist -- the plan was entering its final phase .Every president since then -- Bush , Clinton , and now George W. Bush -- have similarly taken their oaths of office facing the obelisk .It is difficult to think of a more despicable Satanic symbol than the obelisk .All occultists literally worship the Egyptian Sun god , Ra , whom they believe resides within any obelisk .By \" facing the obelisk \" , a person is also worshipping the evil , Satanic spirit within .Given George W. Bush 's deep Satanic background within Skull & Bones , he would understand very well what the Satanic implications were of \" facing the obelisk \" , and of the equally deep Christian concerns about it .Therefore , if he were truly Born Again , he would have pointedly refused to take his oath of office \" facing the obelisk \" .In fact , when Bush faced the obelisk during his first inaugural , I knew right then and there that his conduct during his administration would be Illuminist , and not Christian .If you have not examined our table depicting President Bush 's Evil Fruits vs Good Fruits , please take a few moments to do so now .You will see that Bush has pursued an agenda which is most definitely NOT genuinely Christian .Satanists believe that mirrors are \" transfer points \" also , which is why you constantly see mirrors in occult movies and novels .GOD HATES OBELISKS !To illustrate how offended God is with obelisks , listen to the following Scripture : .This verse tells us not only that God ordered righteous King Jehu to burn the obelisks , but that such worship is from the hated Satanic god , Baal .Thus , George W. Bush obediently faced \" Baal 's phallic symbol \" when he took his oath of office , not a good sign for Christians who truly want to believe that George W. is truly Born Again . \" Israel is a luxuriant vine that puts forth its material fruit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.91163"}

Bush \" faced the obelisk \" , he knowingly faced one of the original symbols of the Masters of the Illuminati .Therefore , we should not be surprised to learn that President Bush has fulfilled every Illuminist plan since the attacks of 9/11 .Cutting Edge has spent the last four years detailing all the instances where President Bush 's actions are most definitely not Christian , but are clearly either pagan or Illuminist .However , we should not be too surprised to learn that President Bush has demonstrated no compunction about facing the Masonic obelisk ( Washington Monument ) , for he fully cooperated with Masons in Texas while he was governor , Masons who devoutly paid obeisance to the filthy obelisk .In his inaugural address , President Bush promised to \" reclaim our public schools \" , a most noteworthy goal .But , my question now is , will he do so in league with Freemasonry , as he did while Governor of Texas ?If he does enlist the support of nationwide Freemasonry , then we have a problem , as evidenced by the following quote by the state 's highest Masonic officer , in his report to the members of the activities and accomplishments of the year 2000 .\" The number of [ Masonic ] cornerstone ceremonies at public schools is an indication to me that there is still a place in our society for this meaningful ceremony .The administrators and students at these ceremonies have been very attentive and have asked questions about what we are doing .This curiosity tells me that we have made a favorable impression upon them and perhaps some of the children will join our fraternity when they are old enough .\" [ \" The Texas Mason \" ] .Wonderful , do we want to encourage our young children to become worshippers of Baal and his penis when they get older ?If we \" reclaim \" our public schools in this manner , are we any better off ?And do not think that the Texas Masonic Lodges are past the point of revering the obelisk , as this picture to the left so amply demonstrates .In 1999 , the Hubert Lodge Number 67 is dedicating a new obelisk .Notice how proudly these men are standing around Baal 's phallus .Is this what we want our children to emulate ?But , let us not forget that Freemasons have been very active for many , many decades all throughout America , dedicating schools , monuments , court houses , and other public buildings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.19313"}

Bush in check , so that you will not lose your discernment .George W. has given us too many Illuminist symbols and has taken too many unchristian actions to ignore .As my Daddy used to say , \" Where there is smoke , there is fire \" .We have seen the smoke caused by these Illuminist symbols during Bush 's two Inaugurations , and we have seen the many members with Illuminist backgrounds he has appointed to his cabinet .We must be controlled and discerning .The End of the Age is upon us , with all its prophesied unparalleled deceptions .Are you spiritually ready ?Is your family ?Are you adequately protecting your loved ones ?This is the reason for this ministry , to enable you to first understand the peril facing you , and then help you develop strategies to warn and protect your loved ones .Once you have been thoroughly trained , you can also use your knowledge as a means to open the door of discussion with an unsaved person .I have been able to use it many times , and have seen people come to Jesus Christ as a result .These perilous times are also a time when we can reach many souls for Jesus Christ , making an eternal difference .If you have accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior , but have been very lukewarm in your spiritual walk with Him , you need to immediately ask Him for forgiveness and for renewal .He will instantly forgive you , and fill your heart with the joy of the Holy Spirit .Then , you need to begin a daily walk of prayer and personal Bible Study .If you have never accepted Jesus Christ as Savior , but have come to realize His reality and the approaching End of the Age , and want to accept His FREE Gift of Eternal Life , you can also do so now , in the privacy of your home .Once you accept Him as Savior , you are spiritually Born Again , and are as assured of Heaven as if you were already there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.56853"}

Sec 19 would take over for the short remainder of the deceased President 's first term .What happens then ?Who gets to be the President at the end of that short period ?Beats me .In such circumstances there would be no living President Elect to assume office .Here 's a minor twist : . pocket veto - The Constitution grants the president 10 days to review a measure passed by the Congress .If the president has not signed the bill after 10 days , it becomes law without his signature .However , if Congress adjourns during the 10-day period , the bill does not become law .Congress can adjourn and designate an agent to receive veto messages and other communications so that a pocket veto does n't happen , an action Congresses have taken routinely for decades .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.77628"}
