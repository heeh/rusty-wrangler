{"text": "Recognizing the historical contingency and limits of the old denominational labels is the necessary first step toward thinking about them usefully .Today 's American Jewish denominations are very much the products of their time and place and of the specific circumstances of American religious life as a whole , heavily shaped as that life has been by essentially Protestant nomenclature and modes of organization .Interestingly , the denominational structure is dramatically different from that prevailing in Israel or other places in the world .No less interestingly , the denomination registering the greatest current growth , or at least the greatest internal retention rate , is the one with the least centralized structure and the most thoroughgoing demands on the faithful - namely , Orthodoxy .So is the denominational structure hopelessly obsolete , as the rise of alternative congregations and rabbinical training schools suggests , and should the movements be thinking strenuously of ways to reconfigure themselves ?There is , as it happens , plenty of thinking going on , and plenty of experimentation even within the denominational template .The crucial distinction may lie between those who explore and those who drift away altogether .The sociologist Steven Cohen has written of a dual process of non-and post - denominationalism .The former term refers to those who maintain only minimal ties to formal Jewish life as a whole and who intermarry in substantial numbers ; the latter , those who remain deeply committed and engaged but who express their commitment outside the large formal structures of the denominations .\" Express \" is a key word here .If one feature of modern life is the ascendance of reason and science as sources of knowledge and authority , another is expressiveness , the conviction that the truth is to be found in one 's own subjectivity and in the recesses of one 's own experience and passions .This impulse , helped along by new technologies and forms of organization that make for more diffuse structures of authority and belief , and by currents like feminism that link the expressive ideal with the demand for equality , has powerfully reworked all of contemporary religion .In Western societies today , even the most stringent form of traditionalism is chosen ; if it does not find an echo in the subjective experience of the individual , it will not long endure .But there is another way of looking at the relation between the impulse to maintain boundaries and the impulse to push beyond them .The late anthropologist Victor Turner observed in The Ritual Process that social and religious life proceeds through a dialectic of structure and anti - structure .Both are essential , the one for continuity , order , and responsibility , the other for meaning , passion , and critique .This systole - and - diastole motion can be seriously destructive if it springs from self - indulgence or slides into mere argumentativeness .When driven by real commitment , it may be one of the healthiest features of Jewish life .It is not the denomination per se but how people view them that causes the problem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.13743"}

{"text": "The first indicator of the movement 's problem - the decline in synagogue affiliation - is not hard to understand .Increasingly , American Jews simply choose not to join synagogues .People see synagogues as too expensive , boring , or irrelevant .This trend is most pronounced in precisely those parts of our country , like the West and Southwest , where the Jewish population is growing most rapidly .The recent economic downturn has merely accelerated an already - existing trend .Thus , if Reform Judaism is to survive , the primary task of its leaders is to focus steadily on promoting synagogue affiliation .Synagogue membership is the citizenship card of Jewish life .It provides the resources needed to create places in which the growing intermarried population can raise Jewish children and Jewish learning can be transmitted to the vast majority of Jewish children , those who do not attend Jewish day schools .Synagogue membership provides funding for the URJ and social capital for other Jewish organizations .This task does not require us to \" reimagine \" synagogues or transform the ways in which they are funded ; the challenge must be not redefined but met .Reform synagogues simply need to do what synagogues have done for the last 2500 years : serve as centers of Jewish living and community .And Reform synagogues , in particular , must maintain an open door for anyone who wishes to walk through it .But if that is the central task , is Reform leadership up to it ?The movement needs high - quality clergy , of course ; it also needs committed lay leadership .The Reform movement was built on the basis of lay - rabbinic partnerships .We need to attract strong dynamic lay leaders who see and feel that the future of the Jewish people depends on them .Too often we reward people simply for showing up .We need to find ways to draw serious people to address the serious challenges of Jewish life .The kind of organizational dysfunction we too often see does not have to be accepted ; it does not exist everywhere in Jewish life .The community Federation in my hometown of Chicago ( Jewish United Fund of Chicago is the technical title ) , for example , while it employs skilled and forceful professionals , also engages lay leaders .More than financial resources , board membership demands a serious commitment of time .In spite of these demands , or because of them , individuals actually compete to be on the board .When lay leaders see that their communities ' future rests in their hands and not just those of professionals , they become energized and active .Some rabbis seem to fear that engaged lay leadership will weaken the authority of the professionals who run communal organizations , but it is more likely that skilled lay leaders will recognize and respect the professionals ' skills .True , respect will not always mean acquiescence ; but the disagreements that arise are more likely to be serious and constructive .Moreover , if lay leadership is stronger , rabbis will be freed to do what they are most qualified to do : articulating a compelling case for Jewish meaning in 21st - century America .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.280426"}

{"text": "\" The Israeli economy is stable and growing , despite the global crisis .Following the recent discovery of offshore natural gas fields , Israel is now even moving toward energy independence .Despite Israel 's objectively impressive achievements , we must acknowledge that the Jewish state has not lived up to a crucial component of its historic mission .For two millennia , until 1948 , the Jews lived in exile , operating as individuals or within the family or community , but never functioning as a group with responsibility for the public domain .For centuries , important aspects of Jewish civilization were underdeveloped because Jews did not have sovereignty .Prior to the establishment of the State of Israel , Jews were always a minority , and never had to deal with the challenge of ruling over a national minority .Thus , one of the most important directives in Jewish tradition - the proper treatment of the \" stranger , \" the Biblical Other - was never tested in practice until the Jews had sovereignty .Jewish religious law did not develop a bill of rights or otherwise regulate relations between the government and its citizens .In addition , since Jews did not have an army or police force in exile , Jewish ethics did not have the opportunity in modern times to respond to debates about the use of force by the collective and other important questions .Jewish tradition is built on a commitment to tikkun olam - repairing the world .Although Jews have devoted themselves to this mission as individuals and groups , it was only upon the establishment of their own nation - state that they could pursue Jewish options for such repair through a sovereign state .The State of Israel was expected to undertake this task , yet this expectation has yet to be fully realized .What explains this delay ?Ever since the 1967 Six Day War , for more than two - thirds of Israel 's history , the Israeli marketplace of ideas has been dominated by the controversy over the country 's borders .In addition , the world , including most Jews , looks at Israel almost exclusively through this prism .Naturally , there are good reasons for this ; continued Israeli rule over another people - even for those who see it as a security necessity - impairs both the Jewish and the democratic character of the state .But because Israeli discourse has focused nearly exclusively on this one question , Israel has , in effect , slipped into an identity coma .An individual 's attitude towards \" the conflict \" has become the determining factor of one 's identity in our generation , a corrosive solvent that consumes everything else .As a result of the debate about Israel 's borders , the question of the nature of national life within those borders - wherever they may lie - has been neglected .How ironic .The recent Israeli elections indicate a change in direction .Against the backdrop of a pervasive sense that the conflict is currently unresolvable - a tragedy in its own right - a new coalition has been formed whose members disagree on foreign policy and defense but come together around a common civic agenda that includes matters of identity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.4915"}

{"text": "About half of American Jews think continued building of Jewish homes in the West Bank hurts Israel .In general the survey reveals a very strong connection to and support of Israel , a positive trend that appears to be slightly increasing .The statistics about intermarriage provide a wealth of information .Whereas 44 % of Jews said they were married to non - Jews , the number rose to 58 % among those marrying since 2005 .Unsurprisingly , 98 % of those identifying as Orthodox married Jews , whereas 50 % of Reform Jews and 31 % of non - affiliated reported doing so .This , combined with the finding that almost 50 % of those born Orthodox change their affiliation , points to increased intermarriage .But these statistics can be misleading .Although it appears \" just 17 % \" of those married before 1970 intermarried , this does not take into account all those who intermarried who no longer identify as Jews and thus are not included in the survey .In 2001 it was reported that 13 % of those who we d before 1970 were intermarried .Were more pre-1970 intermarriages discovered in the past 10 years or did more Jews come forward who intermarried and begin identifying once again as Jews ?The shock expressed after data such as these is released , showing so much intermarriage , reminds us of the \" Will your Grandchildren be Jews \" article published in 1996 in the Jewish Spectator or the \" Vanishing American Jew \" article in Look in 1964 .Reports of the disappearance or decline of American Jewish community due to intermarriage have been exaggerated in the past , and there is no reason to think the current rate of intermarriage is an existential threat .The Pew research provides an important snapshot of the Jewish community , but it should not be concluded that it reveals major shifts , because it does not .Comparing National and Local Population Surveys .The results of Philadelphia 's latest Jewish population study were released almost four years ago , prompting alarm bells about the high level of intermarriage and low level of affiliation among young adults in particular .But the results of the 2009 \" Jewish Population Study of Greater Philadelphia \" - released in January 2010 - were less alarming than the data contained in a new national survey of the American Jewish population undertaken by the Pew Research Center .The two surveys asked similar questions regarding intermarriage , attachment to Jewish community , the raising of children and attitudes toward Israel .The local survey was sponsored by the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia , while the Pew study got major funding from the Philadelphia - based Neubauer Family Foundation , which has partnered with the Federation to fund incentive grants for Jewish camping .The most glaring difference between the national and Philadelphia surveys lies in what is perhaps Pew 's most interesting twist on the contemporary conversation about Jewish identity .In a sense , the survey created a new category by iden\u00adtifying people who consider themselves Jewish by ethnicity but not religion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.03792"}

{"text": "Rabbi Karp 's response , to me , seems to most clearly define the issue .Denominations provide structure whereas without them you have chaos .However when viewed through the lens of Tanach there is a parallel in the choice of the Israelite people between living in chaos as in the period of the Judges and to live like other nations with a king .The king provided structure and security but G - d was more pleased when we did not live under a king .Modernized denominations seek to rationalize and emasculate our history and beliefs , embarrassed with a G - d who talks to men and creates miracles .Chabad refreshingly speaks of an active G - d while allowing people the freedom to live as they see fit .Modern denominations offer us ethnic and philosophical clothing whereas groups like Chabad present a spiritual and religious experience that satisfies a different thirst .Actually , outside the United States , Conservative , which there is called Masorti , is doing remarkably well .Masorti has remained closer to tradition in those countries than it has in the United States .In Britain , it is growing rapidly with former Orthodox - affiliated Jews alienated by Orthodoxy 's rightward shift , as well as some ex - Reform Jews looking for more tradition .In continental Europe and in Latin America it is attracting a lot of the youth .Russia and Australia also have new , thriving Masorti communities and in the past decade an entirely new one has popped up in Uganda .I too , am a generic Jew who speaks Hebrew and is learning Yiddish , who keeps a kosher home , and observes a certain degree of Shabbos .As to what I would affiliate with it depends from country to country .In the United States or Canada I would only affiliate Orthodox , because I feel that Orthodoxy there is very dynamic and diverse and it preserves tradition and encourages learning .Also , North American Jewry is not centrally organized , which enables it to allow for a wide variety of expressions , from the yeshivishe to Chabad to traditional Sephardi and German communities , to centrist Orthodoxy and finally , this new and exciting liberal Orthodoxy which is emerging .In Britain and Europe I would affiliate Masorti , because the Orthodoxy there is very centrally organized and not as dynamic and creative as in America .Also , Masorti is very traditional in those places and at the same time , it is open to converts , which Orthodoxy in those countries is not .In a place like South Africa , I would affiliate Reform , because Reform there is traditional by nature and it is the only viable alternative to a right - wing , centrally organized Orthodoxy that I find very stifling .To those who misunderstand my closing line .It is a take off from Ben - Gurion when asked to define a Jew he said anyone crazy enough to say they are a Jew .It is not identifying ourselves by someone else 's negative assertion of who we are , it is a realization that no matter which denomination you are they still are going to try to kill you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.261765"}

{"text": "News Analysis : Religious Pluralism Battle Erupts Anew on Two Fronts .Exactly one year ago , a committee headed by former Israeli Finance Minister Ya'acov Ne'eman was putting the finishing touches on what was billed as a historic compromise over the conversion crisis in Israel .It aimed to usher in a new era of dialogue between Orthodoxy and the liberal streams of Judaism and to start a process of reconciliation between Israel and Diaspora Jewry .The compromise was designed to avert the Knesset 's adoption of a bill that would codify into law the Orthodox monopoly over conversions to Judaism performed in Israel .It called for the establishment of an institute in which the three major streams of Judaism would be involved in preparing candidates for conversion , while leaving the actual performance of the conversions under Orthodox control .But one year later , that compromise appears destined to become no more than a historical footnote , and some fear its failure could lead to an unprecedented rift in Israel - Diaspora relations .Although the institute is preparing to open , the compromise proposals were never accepted by Israel 's Orthodox Chief Rabbinate .The liberal movements will participate , but without the rabbinate 's endorsement , Reform and Conservative leaders in Israel fear graduates of the institute may never have their conversions recognized .Nothing , they say , will have been achieved .Instead of dialogue , the apparent failure of the Ne'eman Committee 's compromise has sent both sides in the religious pluralism campaign back to the battlefield - which is now being waged on two fronts .Conversions : Orthodox parties in the Knesset are attempting to revive the conversion bill after the Jerusalem District Court last week ordered the Interior Ministry to recognize as Jewish 23 people who underwent conversions performed by Conservative and Reform rabbis .The bill has been redrafted to incorporate the Ne'eman Committee 's proposals .But leaders of the liberal movements say this undermines the spirit of the compromise , which was meant to avoid legislation codifying Orthodox control over conversions .The ruling is being appealed to Israel 's Supreme Court , which is considered likely to uphold it .But recognizing the potential for further discord , Hanan Porat , chairman of the Knesset 's Law Committee , said he would ask the Supreme Court to postpone hearing the appeal until after Israel 's May 17 national elections .The so - called \" bypass bill \" requires every member of a religious council to abide by rulings of the Orthodox Chief Rabbinate .Reform and Conservative leaders are furious , saying the bill mocks the court 's ruling .This week the Knesset Law Committee postponed the second and third votes on the bill by the full legislature .But at the same time , the Chief Rabbinate ordered local religious councils not to convene as long as Reform and Conservative members take their seats .The liberal streams see much at stake in this battle because the religious councils , supervised by the Religious Affairs Ministry , have exclusive jurisdiction over marriage , kashrut , burial and other religious matters for all Jews living in Israel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.27075"}

Marrus .Chur : Harwood Academic Publishers , 1996 .The involvement of Vichy France with Nazi Germany 's anti - Jewish policy has long been a source of debate and contention .As in Germany , the exclusionary laws passed during the Vichy period normalized institutional antisemitism .Anti - Jewish laws entered the legal canon with little resistance , and private lawyers quickly absorbed the discourse of exclusion into the conventional legal framework , expanding the laws beyond their simple intentions , their literal sense , and even their German precedents .Drawing on newly - available archival sources , personal interviews , and historical research , Weisberg reveals how legalized persecution actually operated on a practical level , often exceeding German expectations .Further , he presents a persuasive argument for Vichy law as an acquired Catholic response to a false notion of Jewish Talmudism .The book also compares the Vichy experience to American legal precedents and practices , and opens up the possibility that postmodern modes of thinking ironically adopt the complexity of Vichy reasoning to a host of reading and thinking strategies .Vichy Law and the Holocaust in France raises fundamental and disturbing questions about the ease with which democratic legal systems can be subverted .Richard H.

{"text": "\" They have to bring it to the Knesset now for a first reading , and we have to make sure that it will not happen , \" the chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel , Natan Sharansky , told JTA .Sharansky is leading a coalition against the bill that includes the leaders of the North American Jewish federation system and the non - Orthodox Jewish religious movements in the United States .Rotem 's bill originally was intended to ease the conversion process within Israel and make it easier for non - Jewish Israelis of Soviet extraction to obtain conversions and marry within Israel .Despite its intent , opponents warned that the bill would consolidate control over conversions in the office of the Chief Rabbinate and drive a wedge between Israel and the Diaspora by carrying the risk that non - Orthodox conversions performed in the Diaspora could be discounted in Israel .In addition , they said the bill would affect the eligibility of converts for the Law of Return , which grants the right to Israeli citizenship to anyone who is Jewish or at least has one Jewish grandparent .The opponents urged Rotem to revise the proposal .They believed they had a deal in place with Rotem to hold off on the bill pending more discussion after Rotem came to the United States in April to discuss the bill with them , and after a number of meetings between Sharansky and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .Several top Israeli officials , including the justice minister and minister for Diaspora affairs , had agreed to work with Sharansky on altering the bill .But Rotem caught Sharansky and the Diaspora leaders by surprise by bringing the bill to a committee vote this week ; Sharansky was given only a day 's warning .The move set off a maelstrom of criticism from the Diaspora .The CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America , Jerry Silverman , called Rotem 's action a \" betrayal . \"In an interview with JTA , Rotem was unapologetic about moving ahead and said , \" This bill will pass , no doubt . \"\" I never promised anything , \" Rotem said .\" I told them all the time in the meetings that if I will see there is a majority , I will bring it a vote .No one can say I promised anything . \" In their discussions with Rotem , Diaspora leaders expressed concern about an item in the bill that would have taken away the right to automatic citizenship for anyone who comes to Israel as a refugee but then converts to Judaism .Rotem removed that item before pushing the bill through the law committee .Now , he says , the bill has no effect on American or Diaspora Jews and that this is solely an Israeli matter over which non - Israeli Jews should have no say .\" I do n't know why they wanted to have discussions , \" he said .\" I came to the U.S. I spoke to leaders , and I explained this is nothing that touched the American community .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.895706"}

{"text": "But until now , Rabbi Norman Lamm -- president of Yeshiva University , the fountainhead of modern Orthodox ideology and the training ground for many centrist Orthodox rabbis and educators -- has been noticeably silent .This silence is in marked contrast to his more vocal role a decade ago , when the \" Who is a Jew ? \" debacle threatened Israel - diaspora relations .At that time , Lamm urged the Israeli government to put Jewish unity ahead of the desire of Orthodox political parties to exclude non - Orthodox converts from invoking a Jew 's automatic citizenship in the state of Israel .Now , after months of silence , Lamm has once again come out on the side of Jewish unity , urging his constituents to put compromise and cooperation with the non - Orthodox ahead of theological differences .\" We should vigorously support compromise produced by the Ne'eman Committee , \" Lamm said , referring to the Israeli government - appointed interdenominational committee charged with reaching a solution to the current conversion crisis .The committee is seeking to avert Orthodox - sponsored legislation that would codify Orthodox control over religious life .While the Orthodox need to ensure the validity of all conversions to Judaism in Israel , Lamm said , \" communal peace is also a principle of Judaism .\" Lamm 's remarks came during a speech and in a private interview during a convention of the World Council of Orthodox Leadership , which drew some 650 people to the Homowack Hotel in Glen Springs , N.Y. , over the Thanksgiving weekend .The council is a new umbrella organization representing the leaders of 21 modern Orthodox institutions .The goal of the conference , an organizer said , was to clearly articulate the principles of modern Orthodoxy and to develop a strategy to implement them .The gathering came at a time of intra - Orthodox as well as interdenominational Jewish strife .It is a time when , because of the influence of the right on centrist Orthodoxy , some are questioning what modern Orthodoxy really stands for .Lamm told his listeners that they should value and encourage the efforts of non - Orthodox leaders to more seriously integrate traditional Jewish practices into the lives of their followers .They should welcome the creation of Reform and Conservative day schools and not see them as a threat to their own , Lamm said .In many communities , Orthodox day schools , or Orthodox - oriented community day schools , have large numbers of students from non - Orthodox families .The liberal movements should be appreciated and encouraged because they are doing something Jewish , even if it is not the way that Orthodox Jews would like them to , he said .\" What they are doing is something , and something is better than nothing , \" he said in his speech .\" I 'm very openly attacking the notion that we sometimes find in the Orthodox community that ' being a goy is better ' \" than being a non - Orthodox Jew , he said in an interview .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.971176"}
{"text": "This is a particularly controversial point , so let me explain more fully what I mean .The degrees and kinds of hostility should not be lumped together but need to be understood for what they are .If a synagogue is daubed with a swastika then that is at the very least rhetorically antisemitic , and in any case a crime .Daubing \" Free Gaza \" on a synagogue wall is also a crime , and hugely disrespectful of a religious institution , just as daubing a mosque with some slogan would be .But the phrase \" Free Gaza \" in itself is not antisemitic ; it is a protest , and a reasonable one in my opinion , even if I can see the other side too .Imagine if \" Free Gaza \" were the slogan on a banner at a peaceful protest in front of a synagogue .It is especially so if the synagogue in question has a big banner in front of it asserting \" We support Israel \" , as mine does , to my great disquiet .The main threat of radical Islamism today is not only to Israel , not only to Jews , but to the whole democratic world order , based on liberal pluralism .Antisemitism is only part of it .The whole ideology and the movements it has spawned need to be countered and the societies affected brought back to a reasonable , tolerable , and tolerant , state .Israel thinks itself the centre of all this , but it is not ; America is .When Israel should be helping the forces of democracy in their efforts to counter the threat of Islamism , its government is instead pursuing their narrow , nationalist agenda , at considerable cost to all of us who want a better , more democratic world .Israel 's expansionist nationalism jeopardizes the two - state solution with the Palestinians , and it also directly makes the situation of Jewish communities in Europe and elsewhere in the world more precarious , because of the understandable anger of Arabs , Muslims and other Palestinian sympathizers at these policies .Because its supporters in America have a lock on American congressional politics , Israel also has a hobbling influence on many attempts of American administrations to foster a better global atmosphere for democratic values such as human rights and education for all .AIPAC 's influence has , indirectly , caused America to lose clout in such bodies as UNESCO , because of the admission of Palestine as a state member .Yet it is America and its influence in the UN agencies of the international community that still offer the best hope at countering the horrendous threat of Islamism ( in Europe and America , among alienated Muslim youth , as well as the Muslim world ) today .So Israel , pursuing short - term nationalist aims , is hindering the best options we have in countering the threat of Islamism .It is not helping , it is hurting , the global democratic cause .If the political magic wand of \" antisemite ! \" were taken away from Israel and its supporters that might be a rude awakening for them , but a salutary one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.97246"}

Pereira Mendes founded the Jewish Theological Seminary ( JTS ) in New York City as a more traditional alternative to HUC .The seminary brief affiliated with the traditional congregations established the Union of Orthodox Congregations in 1898 , but this connection was later severed due to the Orthodox rejection of the JTS ' modernistic academic approach to Jewish learning .At the turn of the century , JTS lacked a source of permanent funding and was ordaining on average no more than one rabbi per year .The fortunes of Conservative Judaism underwent a dramatic turnaround when in 1902 , the famed scholar Solomon Schechter accepted the invitation to become president of JTS .Under Schechter 's leadership , JTS attracted a distinguished faculty and became a highly regarded center of Jewish learning .In 1913 , the Conservative Movement founded its congregational arm , the United Synagogue of America .Conservative Judaism enjoyed rapid growth in the first half of the twentieth century , becoming the largest American Jewish denomination .Its combination of traditional practice and limited modern innovation ( such as mixed gender seating ) particularly appealed to first- and second - generation Eastern European Jewish immigrants , who found Orthodoxy too restrictive , but Reform Judaism too liberal .After World War II , Conservative Judaism continued to thrive .During the 1950s and early 60s , as upwardly - mobile American Jews moved to the suburbs , Conservative Judaism still occupied this enviable middle position and experienced a boom in synagogue construction .Reconstructionist split .However , the Conservative coalition splintered in 1963 , when advocates of the Reconstructionist philosophy of Mordecai Kaplan seceded from the movement to form a distinct Reconstructionist Judaism .Kaplan had been a leading figure at JTS for 54 years , and had pressed for liturgical reform and innovations in ritual practice from inside of the framework of Conservative Judaism .Frustrated by the perceived dominance of the more traditionalist voices at JTS , Kaplan 's followers decided that the ideas of Reconstructionism would be better served through the creation of separate denomination .In 1968 , the split became formalized with the establishment of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College .Gender and homosexual issues .In the 1970s and early 1980s , Conservative Judaism was divided over issues of gender equality .In 1973 , the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards ( CJLS ) voted to permit synagogues to count women toward a minyan ( quorum for formal community religious duties ) , but left the choice to individual congregations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.74796"}

Bush and later Barack Obama determined that an Israeli military strike against Iran 's nuclear weapons program does pose a high - level threat to the US .As a consequence , both administrations have taken concerted steps to prevent Israel from attacking Iran .On the merits , both of these policies are easily discredited .But the fact that they continue to be implemented shows that they are supported by a large and powerful constituency in Washington .To oppose Iran 's nuclear program effectively , American Jews are required to oppose these strongly supported US policies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.861244"}
