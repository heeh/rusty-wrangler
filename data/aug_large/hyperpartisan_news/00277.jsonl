{"text": "I am not as educated in Philsophy as some of your readers , but I would like to generalise that statement .To my opinion , liberalism is not only about avoiding pain but about avoiding life in general .For example , the First Law of Liberalism ( after L. Auster ) can be explained on this basis .Because the worse some alien group behaves , the more it makes our life intolerable , hence the more reasons are to avoid life .Any real attempt to improve the situation , to bring life and reason to the world , is therefore undermining liberalism .Actually , we are living in the environment which is in many details hostile to life , though physically comfortable .LA replies : .The other day I came upon an old VFR discussion , I do n't remember which one , where someone said that liberalism is not about life , liberalism is about the self .Charles T. writes : .The description of gentile Christians having only a \" universal or sacrificial ethos \" describes a great majority of my Christian friends .But it does not have to be that way .It is this way because most Christians I know concentrate only on 1 ) salvation - for themselves and others ; and 2 ) the next life to come .If America 's Christians would read and study the OT as well as the New , I think they would see that The Lord is just as concerned for the state of affairs in this world as the next .Example : The Law of Moses is deeply concerned about how we treat our neighbors .Unfortunately , CS 's observation about many Christians is correct .From the comments : A reductivist versus commonsense reading of scripture .Excellent .This is the best summation of why the evangelical church is making so many mistakes in their reading and teaching of scripture .In fact , such reductivism leads many to neglect personal safety and to jettison their God - given personal instincts for survival in order to prove their love for other people thus fulfilling the teachings of their evangelical pastors and ministers .Very sad .Rather than being thinking , discerning Christians , the evangelical movement has reduced their people to trained seals jumping through hoops to satisfy the ridiculous demands of their career minded ministers .Hannon writes : .Why should modern Christianity take in certain cultural or political principles of the current permutation of the \" host \" foundation ?Perhaps it is , rather than anything new or unprecedented , more a natural adaptation to yet another seemingly inexorable tide of social change .This time it is modern liberalism , against which any resistant group or idea is ( quite successfully ) painted as anachronistic and threatening .Christianity may be the ultimate ideal of such resistance , at least in theory .But as secularism more loudly condemns its most intractable antagonists , churches have been increasingly vocal about their support for certain items on the leftist social agenda .The liberal tempo of modern society in the West is mirrored in the behavior of its waning churches and this is wrong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.441906"}

{"text": "African expressions of Christianity have emerged to challenge the Western model which much nineteenth and twentieth century mission brought with it .Evangelicals are often cautious about contextualisation and contextual expressions of theology .This is partly because these have often emerged from liberal churches which place less emphasis on the authority of Scripture , and which are more willing to adopt local resources from a culture 's pre - Christian or non - Christian tradition .It is , however , partly because Western evangelicals are also culturally blinkered .We assume that our own expressions of Christian faith and practice are somehow \" pure \" and untainted by our culture , but , as Bosch and others have demonstrated , Western evangelicalism is strongly influenced by modernity and the Enlightenment .Increasingly , evangelicals involved in mission both as missiologists and as practitioners have embraced the concept of contextualisation , seeing it as vital to enable Christianity to be expressed in culturally appropriate forms , and to be freed from its image as a western religion .Increasing numbers of attacks on Christians by militant Islamic groups in places such as Pakistan , Indonesia and Nigeria , highlights the importance of this .Contextualisation must not be seen simply as a tool to make mission more effective .Truly authentic contextualisation will occur naturally as the Gospel takes root and bears fruit spontaneously within particular cultures .The particular challenge for evangelicals is to let Scripture remain authoritative within any culture , but to realise that all interpretations of the Scripture are affected by cultural presuppositions .Developing good skills in hermeneutics thus is vital .The question of the relationship between the verbal proclamation of the Gospel and its demonstration was ( and in some cases still is ) a particularly thorny one for evangelicals throughout most of the twentieth century .The emergence of the Social Gospel movement which reinterpreted salvation in humanistic rather than eschatological terms caused evangelicals to retreat from their commitment to social action which had characterised them in the nineteenth century .Within the ecumenical movement the goal of mission came to be seen almost exclusively in this - worldly terms .It is a slight caricature , but Western evangelicals tended to be very suspicious of any activity which smacked too much of social or political involvement , except for activities such as medical mission .Even these were mainly of value in creating responsiveness in people for the message of spiritual salvation .It was the Lausanne Congress of 1974 which marked a turning point in evangelical thinking in this area .The contribution in particular of Latin American evangelical leaders such as Rene Padilla , Samuel Escobar and the late Orlando Costas awakened this gathering of evangelical leaders to the challenge of poverty and injustice , and the fact that authentic mission had to respond to these questions .Many Western evangelicals still feel a certain degree of tension between the need to preach \" spiritual \" salvation and work for earthly justice , and there is need for continued reflection on Biblical and theological themes relating to these questions .The Biblical theme which is of most help here is Jesus ' teaching on the kingdom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.575542"}

{"text": "The social gospel became the hallmark of the liberal church , as pointed out above , because the liberals had emptied their message and ministry of biblical truth and were left with no other \" good news \" than solving physical problems .Sadly , evangelicals today are increasingly adopting the missional , social gospel of liberalism .However , it would be unfair to say that this is yet a majority opinion or action among true evangelicals .Rather , the more common approach is to espouse a two - tiered gospel which is composed of the biblical gospel of redemption and the social gospel of world betterment .While this is an upgrade from the purely missional model of liberalism it nevertheless lacks biblical warrant and endangers the true gospel of salvation .Let 's take a look .John R.

{"text": "This is not merely a theoretical discussion , but one which will significantly affect the practice of mission .If western missionaries still approach mission from the perspective that their way of doing things is the right way or the best way they risk being guilty of a kind of ecclesiastical colonialism .The concept of missio dei , the mission of God , is one of the key concepts in contemporary missiology .It signifies a shift away from seeing mission as something , which the church does , to seeing mission as something which God does , indeed as something which God , by his nature , is .Just as the Father sends the Son , and as Father and Son together send the Spirit , so Father , Son and Spirit send the church into the world , as an instrument of God 's sending and saving love .This results in seeing mission as more than just making converts and planting churches , but rather as an expression of God 's love and purpose for the world .There is a lot of strength in this concept , but it presents difficulties for evangelicals in the way that more radical theologians and practitioners have interpreted it .They interpret the mission of God as being anything which leads towards human liberation .So , for example , the activities of Marxist guerrilla movements or , more contemporaneously , ecological activists , even if they have no explicit Christian connection , may be identified as working within the mission of God , since they reflect God 's purposes for the world .This view was strongly represented in WCC circles between the 1960s and 1980s , where \" humanisation \" rather than \" salvation \" was emphasised , and it still has influence today .The evangelical missiologist Chris Wright , in his magisterial work The Bible and the Mission of God , shows how this understanding of mission is thoroughly grounded in a reading of the whole of Scripture .The issue of how Christians involved in mission relate to those of other faith traditions is becoming increasingly important .The twentieth century saw the growth of Christianity to become a truly global religion , but it did not see a corresponding decline in the other so - called \" high \" religions of Judaism Islam , Hinduism and Buddhism .Most growth occurred as people moved from primal religions to Christianity .If anything , there has been a resurgence in these other non - Christian religions as well .This has led to a questioning among some Christians , both about the status of those who either do not hear or who do not respond to the Gospel of Christ , and to the question of how those of other faiths should be approached .Traditional evangelical thinking viewed everyone who did not respond positively to the claims of Christ as eternally lost , and tended to understand the other religious traditions as being either the products of human ignorance or of demonic deception .Some Roman Catholic theologians have suggested approaches which retain the supremacy of Christ but which see Christ as the fulfilment of other religions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.189285"}

Michael Craven .The latter half of the 20th century has seen the emergence of two extremes in the American Church and its relationship to the culture - liberal revisionism on the one side and conservative fundamentalism on the other .Both , I contend , have hindered the work and ministry of the Church .One renders the Christian faith meaningless while the other makes it irrelevant .Liberal revisionism has capitulated to contemporary culture and with it many truths of the historic faith .Liberal revisionism ultimately renders the Christian message meaningless by reducing Christ to anything you want him to be - there is simply no authority in this view beyond your own preference and cultural whims .My concern herein however is not for liberal revisionism but conservative fundamentalism , which has become the predominant view .Additionally , unlike liberal revisionism , conservative fundamentalism remains Christian but a distorted version of it that is often difficult to distinguish .A recent conversation with Os Guinness offers this further insight : .I think Os puts this well when he describes fundamentalism as \" an overlay \" which , as a result , has captured the thinking of many unwitting Christians .This is frequently expressed in terms of conservative politics , Christian nationalism and what one Evangelical writer revealed when he referred to the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount as \" Americanisms . \"Being Christian and being American are often thought to be synonymous .Practically , these expressions are manifest in the almost exclusive reliance upon coercion and politics as the means and method of bringing culture under the influence of biblical principles .The idea is that if \" we \" can only capture political control we can bring about cultural change in a way that recovers biblical values .Cal Thomas refers to this as expecting the \" Kingdom of God to arrive on Air Force One .\" There is no doubt that secularism has achieved its pinnacle in our time , however this does not mean that Christianity was the singular prevailing reality that occupied its place prior to this point .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.65345"}

{"text": "Specifically , Jesus said he was come to fulfill the Law , not abolish it .Not one jot or tittle of the Law would fail .His whole ministry was an unfolding of the Hebrew revelation .Applying that supplementary revelation to Greek , Roman , and Germanic cultures was the work of Paul , Peter , and their successors .Paul understood that the revelation of Christ crucified had universal application .Is it possible that Christ came to fulfill the \" laws \" of other cultures too , laws that were not God - given from the Judeo - Christian perspective ?That appears to have been the assumption of King Alfred when he wrote his code , with its Christian and Hebraic preface to a Germanic schedule of wites and botes .I surmise it was the assumption of other political and ecclesiastical leaders in the early middle ages .It may seem like an act of ultimate Protestantism to reduce Christianity to a minimal and supplementary reinterpretation of existing cultures , but Christianity will only grow stronger by the challenge .This does not involve throwing out 2,000 years of Christian culture , but testing it against its core , as Jesus did the Jewish law and institutions of his era .Eric Gans 's book Science and Faith examines the doctrine of the trinity as an unsurpassed anthropological theory that represents our threefold ( not twofold , not fourfold ) relationship to the originary scene .In my opinion , Gans 's Generative Anthropology , which is a universal theory of human origins and culture , is entirely consistent with Christianity .Your realization of the limitations of Christianity , and that its limitations are a source of its strength , is consistent with this .Gans sees the reciprocity between man and God in the Christian revelation as the fountainhead of the success of market society .It is no coincidence that Islam , with its rejection of that reciprocity , is now the primary vehicle for resentment and opposition of market society .With respect to a people 's right and ability to preserve itself , natural law and divine law were not abolished by Christianity but supplemented .Christianity gives us ways of understanding conflict and negotiating for non - violent resolution that we may not have had before .However , it does not tell us that nations should commit suicide rather than protect their identity and prosperity .It does not tell us there should be no nations , but that the nations can come to Him , as nations .( Cf . your essay on liberal Christianity and the threat to the nations . )If you are a general , you may give a beggar your coat .But that does not mean you have the right to cede your countries ' territory to an enemy .The structure of obligations remains the same , but with a different God making different ultimate claims .Socrates the soldier and critic is very Christian , in this fashion .Neither he nor Jesus imagined that war or wealth or political authority or marriage or capital punishment were abolished , only that the life of the people needed to be renewed by renewed relationship to God .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.1016"}

{"text": "As we follow the shows of the Pope - superstar , we do not realize that the Church in fact is no longer an absolute monarchy , but a sort of constitutional monarchy where we do not know the constitution or the identity of the effective prime minister .The book Jesus of Nazareth ( San Francisco : Ignatius Press , 2011 , pp .362 ) is principally a work of exegesis , which is the interpretation of the Holy Scripture .Exegesis is one of the richest sources of Catholic thought .To have an idea of this richness , it suffices to think of the portentous number of quotes by Fathers and Doctors of the Church offered to us in the Commentaries of the Scriptures by Fr .Cornelius a Lapide .He draws together the great minds of the Church showing their contribution to the unity of the Catholic interpretation of Scriptures .From the 16th century , when a Lapide wrote his work , to the 20th century , this chain became continuously stronger and more consistent .It is a luminous and unbroken tradition of orthodoxy and militancy against error that powerfully reflects the unity of the Catholic Faith and helps the faithful on the path to sanctity .One would expect , therefore , that Pope Benedict XVI would follow that tradition in the book he wrote .It is a vain hope ; this book is not a link in the chain of that tradition .The author practically ignores the 2,000 years of Catholic exegesis .Certainly there are some few quotes of this or that Father or Doctor of the Church , but they are submerged in the much larger number of Progressivist and Protestants authors he cites .It is unpleasant for a Catholic to see Ratzinger bowing respectfully each time he quotes a Protestant .The authors he cites follow the historical method initiated by the liberal Protestants in the 1800s .The Papacy has been constantly diminished ; kissing babies everywhere entered its new agenda .Benedict praises this current to which he unabashedly belongs : \" One thing is clear to me : in 200 years of exegetical work , historical - critical exegesis has already yielded its essential fruit \" ( p. XIV ) .We know that Leo XIII condemned the premises of the historical method when it jeopardizes the divine authority of Scriptures .It was also condemned by St. Pius X and Pius XII for its evolutionist philosophy and its relativization of faith , morals , exegesis , etc . .Besides this first clash with Catholic doctrine in this book , many others are present .If the book were published 100 years ago , these errors would be the easy target of the valorous inquisitors of the Holy Office .I will not focus on them in this article .Denial of a physical Heaven .The point I want to analyze here , which seems to me ' the scoop ' on Benedict 's book , is that now we have a Pope who clearly denies the existence of Heaven .So , Benedict XVI denies that Christ ascended to Heaven , a physical place where He dwells with His resurrected body in the company of the Blessed Virgin Mary , also present there body and soul .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.0585"}

But I do wonder if he reframes the ministry of Jesus and Paul to fit his restoration paradigm .He describes Jesus , for example , in terms of being loving and healing : .Sinners loved Jesus .They literally followed Jesus everywhere .They pursued him from town to town .He spent days with them , meeting their friends , eating meals in their homes , accepting their gifts , and embracing their children .They were suspended in disbelief at encounters with someone who understood truth and beauty , healing and restoration , righteousness , justice , mercy , and grace - and He genuinely loved them .[ 15 ] .The judgment aspect of the ministry of Christ is explicitly set aside : . [Restorers ] work with people of different faiths to relieve social injustice in their communities .They are driven by the belief that Jesus himself was more concerned with engagement than condemnation .As John writes , \" For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world , but to save the world through him \" ( Jn .[ 16 ] .It is of course true that Jesus healed the sick , ministered to the marginalized , and brought beauty to an often ugly world .What glorious truths these are !But he was n't merely the Great Restorer .The accent of his ministry was surely one of mercy and love .However , there is also a strong note of judgment , condemnation and warning in Christ 's teaching .Jesus came not just to restore but to tear down .The \" already - not yet \" theme in view here applies not only to salvation but also to judgment .Consider the words of Matthew 23:32 - 35 : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.3569"}

{"text": "What sets Christianity apart from the other religions in this respect is the Incarnation .\" No one knows the Father but the Son ; \" since we have become acquainted with the Son , we are better informed than others .The Incarnation also explains why Christ 's sacrifice was efficacious , whereas those of Balder and Adonis were not : for the latter are mere angels , so that their sacrifices were pale inadequate imitations of the real , true sacrifice .At best they were sacraments , rather than the thing itself that they signified .This in a nutshell describes all forms of idolatry : they mistake a sign for the reality to which it refers , and from which it derives ; they confuse for Truth a partial quotation thereof .Some of the Fathers considered Plato a prophet , and they revered Jesus ' Alexandrian Jewish contemporary Philo .They did n't shrink from calling the Feast of the Resurrection after the pagan Goddess of the Dawn , Eostre , with whose spring festival it was coincident , because they had always called Jesus the Son of the Morning Star .To them , the Pagan festival in honor of Eostre was obviously a pale imitation of the true Pascha .Christianity presupposes that people are religious , and legitimately so ; if they were not , they would have no interest in Christianity .Rather the same sorts of things can be said of Christianity 's interface with other human institutions .Few are wholly bad ; all could be better with the correction of the Gospel .It presupposes also that humanity is ineluctably parochial , whereas the Church is catholic .So it is that Christianity has flourished under all sorts of political arrangements : Imperial Rome , Medieval feudalism , modern democratic capitalism .Also , because the Truth is a reproach to all forms of error , idolatry and sin in every age and clime , wherever Christianity has flourished , it has really improved its social hosts , such as the Aztecs , the Canaanites and the Britons .True , the Gospel is not primarily about social or political arrangements , but about the Ultimate Reality and how we should behave in virtue thereof , in this world - the only one that can matter to us for the time being - and in the next .But that does not mean that a correct religious orientation to the Ultimate Truth has no effect on worldly life .If you put anything ahead of the will of God , anything at all , then you are ipso facto sinning , thus suffering , more than you would otherwise be .That I am Christian makes me , not more like some other Christian - Lawrence , say , or St. Francis or Mother Teresa - but more like my own better self .At the same time , the more Christian I become , the more I will express Christian virtues , as Lawrence , Francis , and Teresa also all variously do .So with cultures .The effect upon any culture of conversion to Christianity should be , not its destruction , but that it should begin to learn how best to express its truest , best essence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.61301"}

{"text": "Reading on , he further enlightens his reader .The Gospels & 2,000 years of Church teaching on the Ascension are supposedly mistaken ... .On the next page , interpreting the cloud on which Our Lord stood as he rose to Heaven , Benedict affirms that such cloud never existed .He casts doubt on all biblical descriptions of this type .He also reinforces his first denial of Heaven as a physical place when he states : . \" This reference to the cloud is unambiguously theological language .It presents Jesus ' departure , not as a journey to the stars , but as his entry into the mystery of God .It evokes an entirely different order of magnitude , a different dimension of being \" ( p. 282 ) .Theological language for Benedict is a language that does not reflect an objective report of the events .Instead , he sees the cloud as a metaphor used to transmit a theological point .Benedict XVI , therefore , imagines that description as a symbol - and nothing but a symbol - to express that Christ entered the \" mystery of God . \"However , since the \" mystery of God \" is not an easy concept to decode , the only clear point is that Benedict reaffirms here his denial of both the Ascension of Our Lord to Heaven and the reality of Heaven as a physical place .Further on , commenting on the truth we profess in the Creed that Our Lord is seated at the right hand of the Father , he writes : . \"The New Testament , from the Acts of the Apostles to the Letter to the Hebrews , describes the ' place ' to which the cloud took Jesus , using the language of Psalm 110:1 , as sitting ( or standing ) at God 's right hand .What does this mean ?It does not refer to some distant cosmic space where God has , as it were , set up his throne and given Jesus a place beside the throne .God is not in one space alongside other spaces .God is God - he is the premise and the ground of all the space there is , but he himself is not part of it .God stands in relation to all spaces as Lord and Creator .His presence is not special , but divine . 'Sitting at God 's right hand ' means participating in this divine dominion over space \" ( pp .282 - 283 ) .Here Benedict supplies a reason for his denial of the throne of God , which seems also to be the reason for his denial of Heaven as a physical place .I summarize his reasoning in this way : .Conclusion : Therefore , Jesus can not be in a place at the right hand of God .I believe that the major premise is correct applied to the time when man was awaiting the Messiah .God is a pure spirit who is present where He manifests himself .He does not rely on space .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.95606"}

Constitution and its Bill of Rights have the greatest foundation of any other constitution in the world .Offended by the truth , it bans the convictions that once gave rise to social order and prosperity .Its new systems leave no room for an uncompromising moral standard which ca n't be conformed to man 's shortsighted vision of the 21st century community .Also , it would be another prime example of indirect Christian persecution .Second , the trashing of the Ten Commandments has become a new trend in America .In fact , Roy Moore , Chief Justice of the Alabama State Supreme Court , was willing to sacrifice his esteemed position in an effort to save the Ten Commandments from being removed from the state judicial building in Alabama .The Alabama Constitution specifically invokes ' the favor and guidance of Almighty God ' as the basis for our laws and justice system .As the chief justice of the state 's Supreme Court , I am entrusted with the sacred duty to uphold the state 's constitution .Ultimately , why should the Ten Commandments have to be removed from any public building in the United States ?Of course , the answer to this question is really quite simple .It is the arrival of an anti - Christian spirit in America .Public schools fifty years ago were much different than they are today socially and culturally .Christianity was mentioned on a regular basis without fear of being sued by the American Civil Liberties Union .Bible - reading and prayers to the Lord God Jehovah took place each morning before starting the school day .Christmas and Easter were major religious holidays that were recognized within the school setting .Christian icons were seen in the public school setting , also .However , in postmodern America , public schools throughout the United States are eliminating all signs and symbols of the Christian faith .Discrimination toward the teachings of Jesus Christ has become the accepted norm .Any religion , except Christianity , is accepted in a nation founded on the Judeo - Christian ethical system .( 3 )But , public schools in years gone by provided a place for those who did not attend church to find out about Jesus Christ , His love , His mercy , and His plan of salvation for all mankind .Basically , the media could use their influence to deny citizens the truth of what is happening in America and the truth about the Christian influence in America .To that extent , they are pawns of evil and subvert and destroy both the message and the messengers of righteousness .The media does not always report the whole truth , especially about Christianity .In fact , the media is used to attack the Christian faith , much like Hitler did the Jewish faith in World War II .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.4445"}
