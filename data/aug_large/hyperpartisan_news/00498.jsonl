Bush .The NSC is built differently from other parts of the U.S. government in which the Constitution provided for institutional structures to be more important than the influence of any one person .If the president chooses to use it as a system to present himself with various views and to test those views before ensuring their implementation , it tends to work rather well .If he chooses to use it as a mechanism that is more focused on implementation than debate - or more focused on debate than on effective implementation , as sometimes happens - then it does not .If he chooses to ignore formal structures and depend on informal ones as do most presidents , the formal ones fade in relevance .Further , the chemistry of the group and the personalities of the individuals within it play a far greater role in determining its true function than does any preconceived aspect of its structure .Statutes and history are far less important than these transactions , which continuously remake this powerful entity .Philosophies are , of course , of central consequence to this process , in that they shape affinities and the collective character of the group .Tugs of war over ideology are a central tradition of the NSC , and today 's struggle shares much with those of the past , particularly those that have divided the Republican Party throughout the modern era .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.23987"}

Allen , who came to the position after serving as a foreign policy adviser to Reagan during the 1980 campaign .Allen was pushed out in the end of 1981 after allegations surfaced that he had accepted a bribe to secure an interview with Nancy Reagan .Lesson # 1 : If you give anyone a reason to call for your resignation , you 'll be out the door before you can say South Succotash Wisconsin .William\"Judge \" Clark , a former Supreme Court justice in the state of California ( appointed by Governor Reagan ) , moved from California to Washington with Reagan in 1981 .Clark replaced Allen after spending a year at the State Department , where he was primarily keeping an eye on Secretary of State Haig .Clark 's appointment served Reagan by allowing him to show his conservative base that the moderates , like Haig , were not going to push him around .Clark lasted almost 18 months , which probably would have been shorter if not for his close relationship to Reagan .In fact , Clark was believed to be one of only a few people in Washington who could walk into the Oval Office unannounced .Clark also left an extensive record of his time as national security adviser .These files show that Clark was both a close confidant of Reagan and an active participant in foreign policy making decisions .Out of all the memos from the national security adviser to Reagan that I 've seen at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library , Clark 's memos are not only the longest and most detailed , but also include many of his own recommendations .It was no surprise to anyone in Washington that Clark was forced out in 1983 .This brings me to lesson # 2 : Know your role , act the part , and whatever you do , do n't tread on the secretary of state 's turf .Like President Obama looked within the NSC when deciding to appoint Mr. Donilon , Reagan also promoted from within , making Robert\"Bud \" McFarlane his third national security adviser .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.134705"}

{"text": "Arranged chronologically .September 11 , 2001 , was a catalytic event that revealed the core character of the Bush administration 's national security team .As rival factions fought for the president 's ear , the transformative ideals espoused by the neocons gained ascendancy -- triggering a rift that has split the Republican foreign - policy establishment to its foundations .At the same time , the political party controlling that committee has a grip on power in Washington unprecedented in recent history .For the first time in nearly eight decades , the Republican Party has won control of the White House , Senate , and House of Representatives in two consecutive elections .Yet , despite this political monopoly , the elites who exert the most influence on this little - understood , shadowy committee are being buffeted and pulled apart by forces from within .Of course , the irony is that many of these people were not too long ago seen as parts of a whole .All are or once were close .What happened ?Partisan critics have offered theories , many of which distort the facts or speak for key players in ways that suit their own arguments .More revealing and more credible than partisan critics , the picture they paint is useful not only for what it tells us about the operations of the administration during its first term but also for what should be expected from the next four years .THERE 'S SOMETHING ABOUT CONDI .The NSC was established in 1947 as a coordinating mechanism to ensure the president received the benefit of the views of the principal members of his national security team - a reaction to President Franklin Roosevelt 's close - held , ad hoc management style .Its staff was tiny and uninfluential .The NSC 's clout grew modestly during its first couple of decades , but it then emerged as a unique power center during the 1970s under the leadership of national security advisors who shaped it into a modern institution : Henry Kissinger , Scowcroft , and Zbigniew Brzezinski .Since that era , the NSC 's power has ebbed and flowed , but the trend has been in its favor with recent national security advisors eclipsing the influence of their counterparts in the State and Defense Departments .As part of the executive office of the president , the NSC operates with unusual freedom compared to most cabinet agencies .Neither the national security advisor nor any other member of the NSC staff is confirmed by the Senate .As such , the NSC as an entity is not subject to congressional oversight , even though it now performs many of the policymaking functions once reserved for the State Department .Indeed , it has become a preserve for those activities that an administration wishes to conduct beyond congressional scrutiny , as the country learned to its collective discomfort with the revelations of the \" operational \" NSC of Adm. John Poindexter and Col . Oliver North during the Reagan years .The NSC 's power has expanded since the end of the Cold War , as critical constraints on its operations have been removed or reduced .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.04375"}

OK , fine .However neither could Palpatine without help .Why would n't Vader have that same help ?I am not a fictional star wars character in the fictional star wars universe ; but even many of them accuse the Galactic Empire of having no legal right to exist .Even the 2000 realized that legally , Palpatine had the legal right to do what he did , because THEY VOTED HIM THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO .They just realized what they had done too late , but it was still legal .And again , accusation and PROOF are two different things .No one has proof of Palpatine 's treason .No one has proof that Darth Sidious even existed .And yes , you and I know that the Empire is evil , but we are not discussing that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.82477"}

Leahy to carry on necessary day - to - day coordination .President Truman for a time relied upon Special White House Counsel Clark Clifford to provide the Hopkins(Leahy type of personal coordination .Clifford , who was dismayed by the disorder among agencies taking major post - war policy - making decisions , was a key figure in establishing the National Security Council to give institutional stability to national security policy - making .The President could designate \" from time to time \" the Secretaries of other executive departments and the Chairmen of the Munitions Board and the Research and Development Board to attend meetings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.017334"}

{"text": "In the Department of Defense , for example , the National Military Command Center is colocated but separate from the National Military Joint Intelligence Center .Likewise , in the State Department and at CIA headquarters , operations and intelligence activities are separated .In the White House , this means that the relationship between policy development and current intelligence can be extremely close .The close connectivity between intelligence and policy also means that the White House is not a passive consumer of intelligence .Even at the national level , information has an \" operational \" and sometimes \" tactical \" dimension .Diplomatic and intelligence cables may be closely correlated with Presidential events , perhaps allowing a glimpse of the talking points of a foreign head of state only hours or minutes before he meets with the President .A third feature is the small size of the Sit Room staff .By all measures , the Sit Room is the smallest of the Washington - area operations and intelligence centers .This has come to mean a relatively junior staff .Senior Duty Officers are perhaps O-3 , or GS-12 or 13 equivalents , as compared to O-6 or GS-15 equivalents elsewhere .Limitations of size and depth , however , can in part be offset by quality personnel , high standards of performance , the Sit Room 's interagency character , excellent technical support , and the motivation that comes with working inside the White House .In addition to the Sit Room 's inherent limitations stemming from the small size of its staff , it lacks many advantages of a large intelligence agency .But the Sit Room does not need such advantages to fulfill its mission , and it should not be considered a peer competitor for influence in the IC .The implications of the Sit Room 's proximity to the President , moreover , should not be underrated .Despite its limitations , the Sit Room by virtue of its location has greater access and potential impact on White House officials than any of Washington 's other operations and intelligence centers .Implications for Leadership .A better understanding of the role of the WHSR has important implications for NSC leadership and for the intelligence agencies which supply both information and personnel to the NSC staff , including the Sit Room .There is a need within the NSC for continuing education and dialogue among staff and leadership about the role and potential of the Sit Room in support of NSC activities .An orientation to Sit Room operations should be mandatory for incoming NSC staff officers .Likewise , an orientation to the NSC and interagency process should be mandatory for incoming Sit Room Duty Officers .In addition , the National Security Adviser , Executive Secretary , and Sit Room Director should nurture in their personal interactions a routine concept of operations for crisis management .The enemy in crises is confusion and \" ad hocracy \" ; responsibilities and expectations need to be as clear as possible .Sit Room personnel provide some of what little continuity exists within the NSC staff , and they are often able to observe potential gaps in the complex , fast - moving crisis management process .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.16794"}

Rubin was the first to be appointed to this position .The NEC was to deal with foreign and domestic economic issues in much the same way as the NSC coordinated diplomatic and security issues , and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy was to be included in meetings involving international economic issues .In January 1993 , Clinton appointed W.

{"text": "The NSC staff is organized into regional and functional directorates located in the Old Executive Office Building ( OEOB ) .A directorate is headed by a Senior Director , who is appointed by the President to coordinate and oversee Presidential policy in a particular area .A Senior Director 's counterpart at State or Defense would be at the Assistant Secretary level .The Senior Director supports the National Security Adviser , in effect coordinating the interagency policy agenda in a given area .The directorates are best described as a mile wide and an inch deep because they usually consist only of a Senior Director assisted by two to four directors .On a day - to - day basis , the Sit Room supports the NSC directorates by electronically routing nearly 1,000 messages to staff members ; scanning cables , newswires , and press reports ; and monitoring CNN for fast - breaking events .It is important that the NSC 's Directorate for Intelligence Programs not be confused with Sit Room operations .The Intelligence Directorate oversees interagency intelligence policies and programs such as covert action Findings , counterintelligence , major procurement projects , and the interagency intelligence budget ; it has no responsibility for production , dissemination , or coordination of current intelligence .Direct Sit Room contact with the NSC staff increases markedly during crises .Intelligence Support to Policymakers .Efforts to strengthen intelligence support to policymakers have a long history .Every administration seems to reach its own modus vivendi , squaring expectations with realities between the policy and intelligence communities .As in the creation of the Sit Room itself , postcrisis evaluations often are catalysts for change .Many adjustments in organization , process , and personnel have been made over the years in response to the problems perceived at the time .We describe below a model that was used successfully in the late 1980s to strengthen intelligence support at the NSC Senior Director and Interagency Working Group level .In the late 1980s , the connectivity of the Sit Room to the NSC staff benefited from the assignment of several regional and functional intelligence analysts to the Sit Room staff .These analysts worked for the Sit Room Director but had offices in the OEOB and were assigned to the NSC 's regional and functional directorates .Their job was to provide tailored current intelligence support to the staff and to serve as a focal point for Sit Room support in the directorates .Though a recent casualty of personnel cutbacks , this approach was developed after several years of trial and error focused on improving internal and external intelligence support for the National Security Adviser and the NSC staff .Use of intelligence analysts to provide daily intelligence augmentation to NSC directorates was previously considered necessary to keep up with even the normal volume of relevant intelligence and cable traffic .At the same time , resulting from their close association with the policy staff , intelligence analysts also garnered an insider 's perspective on interagency policy deliberations .This perspective strengthened the Sit Room 's ability to anticipate specific intelligence requirements .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.53885"}

{"text": "Whereas the NIO is focused on future ( although sometimes near - term ) requirements for collection , production , and analysis , the Sit Room analyst was focused on ensuring access to today 's information already available in the Community , and on effecting close coordination at the working level .Interagency Connections .In addition to providing current intelligence support to the NSC staff in important regional and functional areas , the Sit Room has a more independent role to play as an operations and intelligence center .There is a constant need for daily coordination on current issues with other centers , especially at the Defense and State Departments and CIA .This coordination takes place largely out of view of the NSC staff and leadership , but is nonetheless critical to the effectiveness of the interagency system .Sit Room responsibilities sometimes extend beyond intelligence and national security functions .Comparisons With Other Washington - Area Centers .Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of the Sit Room is its proximity to the President .As in real estate , the operative principles are location , location , and location .To be sure , the President gets most important intelligence advice and inputs from the Director of Central Intelligence , NIOs , and other key officials .But these officials can not be at the White House 24 hours a day .The Sit Room often is the \" first phone call \" when senior White House officials are looking for the latest intelligence information , and it plays a key role in synthesizing cables and intelligence products originated by other agencies .A second feature is that the Sit Room is both an operations and intelligence center for the White House .These activities are divided in most departments and agencies .In the Department of Defense , for example , the National Military Command Center is colocated but separate from the National Military Joint Intelligence Center .Likewise , in the State Department and at CIA headquarters , operations and intelligence activities are separated .In the White House , this means that the relationship between policy development and current intelligence can be extremely close .The close connectivity between intelligence and policy also means that the White House is not a passive consumer of intelligence .Even at the national level , information has an \" operational \" and sometimes \" tactical \" dimension .Diplomatic and intelligence cables may be closely correlated with Presidential events , perhaps allowing a glimpse of the talking points of a foreign head of state only hours or minutes before he meets with the President .A third feature is the small size of the Sit Room staff .By all measures , the Sit Room is the smallest of the Washington - area operations and intelligence centers .This has come to mean a relatively junior staff .Senior Duty Officers are perhaps O-3 , or GS-12 or 13 equivalents , as compared to O-6 or GS-15 equivalents elsewhere .Limitations of size and depth , however , can in part be offset by quality personnel , high standards of performance , the Sit Room 's interagency character , excellent technical support , and the motivation that comes with working inside the White House .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.77201"}

Allen , who came to the position after serving as a foreign policy adviser to Reagan during the 1980 campaign .Allen was pushed out in the end of 1981 after allegations surfaced that he had accepted a bribe to secure an interview with Nancy Reagan .Lesson # 1 : If you give anyone a reason to call for your resignation , you 'll be out the door before you can say South Succotash Wisconsin .William \" Judge \" Clark , a former Supreme Court justice in the state of California ( appointed by Governor Reagan ) , moved from California to Washington with Reagan in 1981 .Clark replaced Allen after spending a year at the State Department , where he was primarily keeping an eye on Secretary of State Haig .Clark 's appointment served Reagan by allowing him to show his conservative base that the moderates , like Haig , were not going to push him around .Clark lasted almost 18 months , which probably would have been shorter if not for his close relationship to Reagan .In fact , Clark was believed to be one of only a few people in Washington who could walk into the Oval Office unannounced .Clark also left an extensive record of his time as national security adviser .These files show that Clark was both a close confidant of Reagan and an active participant in foreign policy making decisions .Out of all the memos from the national security adviser to Reagan that I 've seen at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library , Clark 's memos are not only the longest and most detailed , but also include many of his own recommendations .It was no surprise to anyone in Washington that Clark was forced out in 1983 .This brings me to lesson # 2 : Know your role , act the part , and whatever you do , do n't tread on the secretary of state 's turf .Like President Obama looked within the NSC when deciding to appoint Mr. Donilon , Reagan also promoted from within , making Robert \" Bud \" McFarlane his third national security adviser .Out of all of Reagan 's national security advisers , McFarlane 's approach to the position is the only one that I have found to be documented : .There are many models for providing advice to the President and we should pursue the one which the President prefers .The experience of the first term suggests that the President looks to his Cabinet Officers as the primary source of policy advice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.20595"}

{"text": "Thus , virtually all national security correspondence passes through the Executive Secretary .For this reason , the Sit Room has often been administratively assigned to the Office of the Executive Secretary .With inclusion of the Sit Room , the Executive Secretary becomes the focal point for all information going to the National Security Adviser , from the deliberative ( \" slow paper \" ) policy process to fast - moving perishable intelligence and crisis information .As coordinator of the President 's national security schedule , the Office of the Executive Secretary also has an enormous reservoir of policy and operational information at its fingertips .It is through this key relationship that the Sit Room will first hear of a proposed Presidential trip abroad or a potential call to a foreign head of state .A second essential connection for the WHSR is its relationship with the National Security Adviser , formally known as the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs .He and the Deputy are the officials most \" in the know , \" and they are in frequent and direct contact with NSC principals and key subordinates .Because of the Sit Room 's role in the alert process , its position as the funnel for national security information when the President is traveling , and its 24-hour capability , a close working relationship with the National Security Adviser usually develops .For the system to work at its best , a special trust has to be established among the National Security Adviser , the Executive Secretary , and the Sit Room Director .This trust is especially important in establishing the thresholds for warning and alert after hours and providing advance notice of future events .Upon the death of a foreign head of state , for example , it may not be necessary to awaken the National Security Adviser or the President in the middle of the night .If there are no threats to American citizens involved and no action for the President to take , perhaps a \" wake - up \" notification at 5 a.m. would suffice .Similarly , it is not unusual for the Sit Room Director to be included in sensitive interagency meetings before initiation of military operations or for the National Security Adviser to instruct the Sit Room that a special \" Eyes Only \" message should be brought directly upstairs .Establishing such trust can be developed only through close and routine personal interactions .Through daily interaction with the Executive Secretary and National Security Adviser ( including the Deputy ) , and routine access to the schedules and agendas of interagency meetings , the Sit Room Director is able to provide effective operational guidance to Watch Teams .The teams are then in a better position to assess the value and importance of incoming cables and newswires in the context of long - range policy issues under discussion at the highest levels , as well as fast - breaking crises that will demand Presidential attention .This intimate knowledge of the President 's schedule makes the Sit Room unique among Washington - area operations and intelligence centers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.869064"}

Shultz as his new Secretary of State .In his July confirmation hearings , Shultz emphasized the primary role of the President in the formulation of policy and stressed the collegial nature of policy formulation in the Reagan administration .Shultz also referred to the delegation of authority as laid out in NSDD(2 as the source of his own responsibilities and authority .The apparent resolution of the dimensions of the Secretary of State 's authority ironically coincided with ever - increasing activities in the foreign affairs field .The NSC frequently disagreed with the Department of State over the management of daily U.S. foreign relations problems .One observer called the NSC a \" bee hive of activity . \"An NSC - chaired group took over arms control responsibilities from a State - chaired group ( SAC / G ) and ramrodded the tough negotiating position favored by ACDA Chief Fred Ikle and Richard Perle of the Defense Department .Deputy National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane replaced Philip C.

{"text": "The innovations of a Presidential administration often do not survive its close , reflecting as they do the distinctive views and management style of the President and his immediate advisers .The close of the Johnson administration brought an end to several of the adaptations it had made to manage foreign policy : Tuesday luncheons , anticipatory - type NSC meetings , and the SIG / IRG structure .President Nixon and his National Security Adviser , Henry Kissinger , dominated the making of U.S. foreign policy during the Nixon Presidency .As Nixon recalled in his memoirs : \" From the outset of my administration , . . .I planned to direct foreign policy from the White House .Therefore I regarded my choice of a National Security Adviser as crucial . \"Henry Kissinger worked through a National Security Council apparatus he revised and fashioned to serve his needs and objectives and those of the President .The close relationship between the President and the National Security Adviser was the basis for their ability to carry out American foreign affairs leadership around the world .The National Security Council system was the mechanism for the period of unprecedented American activism in foreign policy and the exercise of Kissinger 's growing power .Kissinger wrote later that \" in the final analysis the influence of a Presidential Assistant derives almost exclusively from the confidence of the President , not from administrative arrangements .\" The two men developed a conceptual framework that would guide foreign policy decisions .Kissinger 's intellectual ability , his ambition , and his frequent discussions with Nixon were all factors in increasing within the government both his own power and the unchallenged authority of the NSC system he personally directed .The Kissinger NSC system sought to combine features of the Johnson and Eisenhower systems .The Senior Interdepartment Group ( SIG ) of the Johnson White House was replaced by an NSC Review Group ( somewhat similar to the Eisenhower - era NSC Planning Group ) together with an NSC Under Secretary 's Committee .The Kissinger NSC relied upon interdepartmental working groups ( IGs ) to prepare for NSC directives .Critics observed that 10 IG meetings prepared the way for each SIG - level meeting , and 5 SIG meetings were needed to prepare for each NSC meeting .White House direction of foreign policy meant the eclipse of the Department of State and Secretary William Rogers .Nixon did not trust the Department bureaucracy .According to Kissinger , Nixon picked Rogers , who was inexperienced in foreign affairs , to indicate that the President would dominate the relationship between the NSC and the Department of State .Throughout Nixon 's first term , only Kissinger participated in the President 's important discussions with foreign state visitors .Nixon excluded Rogers from his first meeting with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin in February 1969 .The NSC also took control of the process of clearing key policy cables to overseas posts .Kissinger and Rogers became rivals and developed formal contacts in place of substantive discussions .The NSC(Department of State power relationship was reflected in institutional arrangements .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.173004"}

{"text": "The SCC was charged with considering issues that cut across several departments , including oversight of intelligence activities , arms control evaluation , and crisis management .Much of the SCC 's time during the Carter years was spent on SALT issues .President Carter changed the name of the documents in the decision - making process , although the mechanics of NSC review differed little from that of previous administrations .The Presidential Review Memorandum ( PRM ) replaced the National Security Study Memorandum ( NSSM ) , and the Presidential Directive ( PD ) supplanted the National Security Decision Memorandum ( NSDM ) .PRMs identified topics to be researched by the NSC , defined the problem to be analyzed , set a deadline for the completion of the study , and assigned responsibility for it to one of the two NSC committees .If the selected committee were the Policy Review Committee , a member was designated to serve as study chairman .The study chairman assigned an ad hoc working group to complete the study , which was ultimately reviewed by the responsible committee ( either the PRC or SCC ) .When the committee was satisfied that the study had incorporated meaningful options and supporting arguments , the study 's conclusions went to the President in a 2- or 3-page memorandum , which in turn formed the basis for a Presidential Directive .The actual operation of the NSC under Carter was less structured than under previous Presidents .The Council held few formal meetings , convening only 10 times , compared with 125 meetings during the 8 years of the Nixon and Ford administrations .Instead , Carter used frequent , informal meetings as a decision - making device , typically his Friday breakfasts , usually attended by the Vice President , the Secretaries of State and Defense , the NSC Adviser , and the chief domestic adviser .The President counted on the free flow of ideas , unencumbered by a formal setting , to increase the chances of an informed decision .Critics have contended that the Carter NSC staff was deficient in certain respects .The NSC 's emphasis on providing advice was effected at the expense of some of its other functions , particularly its responsibility to monitor implementation of the President 's policies .Also , the President 's and some of his principals ' commitment to arms control skewed the formation and execution of a broad range of foreign policy options on national security questions .Without any clearly - developed foreign policy principles beyond a commitment to arms control , he often changed his mind , depending on the advice he was receiving at the time .Carter 's preference for informality and openness increased the diversity of views he received and complicated the decision - making process .Every Friday , for example , the President breakfasted with Vice President Mondale , Secretary of State Vance , Secretary of Defense Brown , Brzezinski , and several White House advisers .No agendas were prepared and no formal records were kept of these meetings , sometimes resulting in differing interpretations of the decisions actually agreed upon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.31478"}

{"text": "Search form .How the left can be radical without spending money .Balls 's speech made way for a new agenda that is profoundly exciting .Ever noticed how shutting one door can open another ?This week Labour 's staunchest champion of growing our way out of the deficit acknowledged that he could well be making cuts in 2015 .The left , personified by Owen Jones and Len McCluskey , were up in arms .They think we 've lost the possibility of being radical .I say we 've opened it up .The modern left frequently makes one mistake .They assume that the most significant means government has of transforming lives is through taxing and spending , traditionally known as the \" demand \" side of the economy .They have left the supply side - the rules that govern the price of labour and capital - to the right .But what if , at a time of pressure to reduce government spending , the left could develop an agenda for the supply side of the economy that delivered meaningful change ?It 's not surprising we 're sceptical .Because the right have dominated such policy in the past , such an agenda is associated with smashing unions to decrease the cost of labour , deregulating capital to enrich the fortunate or privatising at the expense of quality .But supply side policy does n't have to be regressive .It 's just a tool that 's been used in the wrong way .Most recently , Ed Miliband has been talking about a number of supply side policies that are courageous , imaginative and proudly consistent with the values of the left .The most high profile example is his attack on certain energy and transport companies .We know that these markets are sown up , so increasing competition and regulation will deliver a fairer result .The living wage is another example .Government contracts that build in apprenticeships and local investment is another .The High Pay Commission 's work on wage transparency and shareholder representation on boards is another .Cutting down on corporate tax havens as Miliband just outlined is another .Breaking up the banks takes this one step further .Although it needs sexier branding , these supply side policies are all part of what Miliband calls \" responsible capitalism \" .It 's why Blue Labour is interesting .These policies have three big advantages .First , they do n't cost anything .Second , they make people 's lives better .Third , they are much closer to where the public is at .I appreciate the arguments made by Owen Jones , but I do n't think he has appreciated the scale of anger there is about a perceived waste of public money by Labour in the good times .As someone who remembers what it was like to not have enough chairs in their classroom , I 'm never going to apologise for investing in schools , and you 'll never hear me say that government spending is n't essential and necessary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.843445"}

{"text": "Best to leave him in the wilderness .This in a movie that begins with a montage showing us that President Obama and his minions are ineffective at defending us from the North Koreans ( and their secret Russian puppetmasters ) .The original Red Dawn had an unabashed political purpose - it warned us not to let our guard down , it encouraged us to support massive increases in defense spending , it encouraged us to stockpile guns and canned goods .It especially wanted us to call our congresspeople and tell them to support funding for the Contras and similar anti - communist forces .The September 1984 issue of Soldier of Fortune magazine includes an article about Red Dawn 's production , particularly its weaponry , that begins : \" Military strategists have often discussed the repercussions of a communist takeover of Central America .One worst - case scenario has the Soviet Union training Cubans and Nicaraguans in the offensive use of advanced weapons such as the MiG 25 and T-72 tank .\" The article ends : .Red Dawn seriously attempts realism .Milius spent $ 17 million trying to give the American public a taste of what Soviet weaponry , tactics and occupation practices are all about .Liberal critics will howl about Reagan 's deleterious effect on the creative arts and scream that Red Dawn is unabashed saber - rattling propaganda .It sounds like our kind of movie .Red Dawn opens across the country on 17 August .So yes , Red Dawn was propaganda in 1984 .But it was not merely propaganda ; there is cleverness and even humanity to it .It 's an action / survival movie , so character development is n't a particular goal , but where it spends it moments of character development are telling .Instead of just building of family melodrama , the original Red Dawn gave humanity to some of the antagonists ( particularly Colonel Bella ) .While the Soviet commanders are cartoons , the Russian soldiers are clearly just as trapped in the horrific logic of war as the Wolverines .The new Red Dawn also wants to be propaganda , as the opening montage shows us .But there are more subtle connections to not just right - wing militarism , but extremist nuttiness .The key is three letters : EMP .How do the bad guys invade North America ?They wipe out the American defense infrastructure , and apparently the entire American military , by setting off at least one electromagnetic pulse ( EMP ) .Now , EMPs are real .Boeing is even developing an EMP missile .But who gets really excited at the idea of an EMP knocking out electronic infrastructures ?The apocalypse addicts at WorldNet Daily .Famed doomsayer Newt Gingrich brought it up during the Republican primary .Right - wingers get positively giddy at the idea .Why ?Because it justifies lots of spending on missile defense .But according to the right wingers , President Obama is not spending nearly enough money to defend us from missiles .We could be wiped out at any moment by an EMP .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.21086"}

{"text": "I would prefer something a bit bolder .This would involved finding things that the Democrats or the President will support .There 's a strain of thought among conservatives , exemplified by the NRO piece above , that working with Democrats will give \" legitimacy \" to Obama .Nuts to that .The country needs things done .And if we can the President on board , great .But the Republicans should also pass legislation they know will be filibustered or vetoed .This could give the Democrats something to talk about in 2016 ( \" look at the extreme legislation we blocked ! \" )But I think it more likely , if Republicans are smart ... OK , if they 're not too dumb ...OK , if they 're not completely stupid ... that it would give the Republicans something to run on in 2016 .It would give the American people something to vote for , not just something to vote against .When the Republicans have run on a positive agenda - Reagan in 1980 , Newt in 1994 - they have done well .As for specific issues : the first on that list would be entitlement reform .The President has indicated that he is open to it .It 's time to call his bluff .The deficit has been shrinking in recent years but will soon begin to blow up as the bill for Baby Boomer retirees comes do .The time to act is now , before we are back in the land of trillion dollar deficits .A lot of Republicans worry that overhauling Medicare and Social Security will open them up to attack from the Democrats .But here 's the thing : that 's going to happen anyway .The number of elections that have not included a Democrat \" mediscare \" campaign over the last forty years is precisely zero .The Democrats are going to demonize Republicans anyway .At the very least we could get something out of it .And if it costs the Republicans some seats , so be it .It would be worth it to slice trillions off our debt .The counter - argument is they should wait until the Republicans have the White House as well .That way , they wo n't have to compromise with Democrats and accept a tax hike or defense spending cuts in return for entitlement reform .I find that hope ridiculously optimistic .It assumes that Republicans will take the White House and keep the Senate .And it assumes that they will take the political risk of entitlement reform once they have full power , which I find unlikely .Act now .At the very least , call the President 's bluff .Then you 'll have something to run on in 2016 .The second priority should be regulatory reform , which is sucking a couple of trillion dollars out of the economy .Probably the most important regulatory reform is the repeal of Sarbanes - Oxley , which is strangling our economy , halting IPOs and a nightmare for businesses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.39903"}

{"text": "Why does this change without Palpatine around , when Vader becomes the Avatar of the Dark Side ?The Empire is afraid of Palpatine because he has Vader and his military , which Vader commands , despite retarded claims to the contrary .So again , why does that fall apart when what and who you are fearful of in the first place , now becomes the Emperor ?Totalitarian states are run on fear , in all it 's forms .Vader , even moreso that Palpatine , in the public eye , personifies that , yet for some reason , the Empire dissolves with Vader on the thrown ...WHY ?Now if you want to say Vader ca n't run the bureaucracy of the Empire ... OK , fine .However neither could Palpatine without help .Why would n't Vader have that same help ?Palpatine was once a politician .He understood and could manipulate politics .He manipulated the Senate well enough to transition seamlessly from ' republic ' to ' constitutional monarchy ' ( which is probably how a lot of senators imagined the government would look in Ep .III , with the Senate at least continuing to matter ) , and then to ' absolute dictatorship . 'Originally , the Senate was holding all the cards , and Palpatine was able to take those cards , and move them into his hands largely with the consent of the people ( since he did n't yet have the armed force to compel obedience ) .Moreover , he was then able to deal the cards out by delegating authority , while still keeping enough mutually balanced power blocs ( Tarkin , Vader , the imperial bureaucracy , the imperial intelligence services ) that none of them grew powerful enough to threaten his own position .This is a skill that Vader lacks .Vader replaces this skill with the use of personal terror .He 's not stupid or a brute , but he has very little , if any , political subtlety .So the real question is : can Vader manage a complicated political environment where he must master ALL aspects of the Imperial state , not just maintain his own specialist position as Palpatine 's hatchet - man and confidant ?Palpatine 's political skill was such that he could easily outmaneuver any opposition within the state- we know this because he did exactly that to secure power in the first place .Where is the evidence of Vader 's political skill ?Without that skill , and without people who are personally loyal to him , not just in the sense of ' will obey ' but in the sense of ' actively seek to further his interests , ' he 's not going to make all that good an emperor .Nobody does .Who does Vader have who 's loyal to him that way , the way that people like Himmler and Goebbels were to Hitler ?Men who could be trusted with independent power over political features of the state , because the dictator could depend on them to further his interests , and not their own , so long as he lived ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.27945"}
{"text": "A number of international organizations , including Amnesty International , are now calling for an independent and impartial investigation into the July 12 , 2007 , helicopter attack shown in the leaked video .But I think this leaked video tells a bigger story than the attack itself .It tells a story of systemic , cold - blooded murder , and the shameful cover up by mainstream media and silence by international organizations .Remembering the last seven years and conducting investigations is important , but what is more important and urgent is to end this occupation .This month marks both the seventh year of occupation and the beginning of the combat forces withdrawal in accordance with President Obama 's plan .The current plan for US withdrawal is based on two sets of time - based deadlines .Obama 's own plan to withdraw combat forces between April and August 31 , 2010 , and the bilateral security agreement 's deadline for the withdrawal of all troops and contractors and shutting down all US bases by December 31 , 2011 .While the Bush administration adopted a conditions - based withdrawal plan based on the mantra \" as Iraqis stand up , we will stand down , \" the withdrawal doctrine under Obama has been time - based , not linked to conditions on the ground .The main problem with a condition - based withdrawal plans is that it creates an equation where deteriorating conditions lead to an extension of the military occupation .Unfortunately , many groups would like to see the US occupation of Iraq continue .Some groups , such as the Iraqi ruling parties or the military industrial complex in the United States , believe the occupation is in their self - interest .Others , such as al - Qaeda , hope to cripple the United States by keeping it engaged in a conflict that is taking an enormous toll on human lives , money and global reputation .And still others , such as Iran and other regional players , fear the re - emergence of a strong independent and united Iraq that would change the power balance in the Middle East .The conditions on the ground are rapidly deteriorating in Iraq .After last month 's general election , there is a dramatic spike in violence and growing threats to the security and political stability of the country .This week alone , hundreds of Iraqis were killed and injured because of car bombs , assassinations , and other armed attacks .Meanwhile , the Iraqi political establishment is struggling to form the new government .The US war machine is already trying to use this deterioration as an excuse to delay or cancel the withdrawal plan , or at least link it to conditions on the ground .Going back to a condition - based plan will cost the US hundreds of billions more , will result in the deaths of countless more US soldiers and Iraqi civilians and , most importantly , will not bring Iraq closer to being a stable and prosperous country .The US occupation has never been a part of the solution and it will never be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.30513"}

{"text": "Yet it is a comparison that exposes Trump 's weaknesses and his strengths .Both men were once Democrats who came later in life to the Republican Party , projecting toughness , certainty and unabashed patriotism .Trump has even adopted Reagan 's 1980 campaign promise to \" make America great again \" .Like Reagan , he has shown he can appeal to evangelicals despite question marks over his religious conviction and divorces .In his ability to deflect criticism , too , Trump has shown himself as adept as Reagan - if by defiance rather than by charm - and redefined what it means to be \" Teflon \" in the age of Twitter .That defiance , however , points to a huge difference in tone between Reagan 's candidacy and Trump 's .Reagan 's vision was a positive , optimistic one , even as he castigated \" big government \" and the perceived decline of US power .Reagan 's America was meant to be \" a city upon a hill \" offering a shining example of liberty to the world - in rhetoric at least .Trump 's vision is of an America closed off from the world .His rhetoric invokes fear as often as it does freedom .On a personal level , Reagan avoided the vituperative attacks that have been the hallmark of Trump 's campaign , even as he took on the then\"establishment \" of the Republican Party - a moderate , urban , east coast elite .In his first run for the nomination , in 1976 , Reagan even challenged an incumbent Republican president , Gerald Ford , and came close to defeating him .But he mounted the challenge on policy grounds , advocating the so - called \" Eleventh Commandment \" : \" Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican . \"Trump , as the TV debates between the Republican presidential candidates made clear , does not subscribe to the same precept .More importantly , Reagan in 1976 and 1980 was the leader of a resurgent conservative movement , with deep wells of political experience .He had been president of the Screen Actors Guild in the late 1940s , waging a campaign to root out communist infiltrators .He had gone on to work for General Electric in the 1950s as a TV pitchman and after - dinner speaker , honing a business message that resonated beyond the \" rubber chicken circuit \" .In 1964 he grabbed headlines with a televised speech on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate , Barry Goldwater - a bright spot in Goldwater 's otherwise ignominious campaign .Two years later he was elected governor of California - serving for eight years as chief executive of the nation 's most populous state .He built a conservative record on welfare reform , law and order , and business regulation that he pushed on to the federal agenda when he ran for president .All this is to say that Reagan 's candidacy was built on more than his celebrity .By contrast , Trump not only lacks experience as an elected official , he is n't part of any organised political movement - which enhanced his \" outsider \" status , perhaps , but not his ground game .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.67575"}

{"text": "This major legislation also provided for a Secretary of Defense , a National Military Establishment , Central Intelligence Agency , and National Security Resources Board .The view that the NSC had been created to coordinate political and military questions quickly gave way to the understanding that the NSC existed to serve the President alone .The view that the Council 's role was to foster collegiality among departments also gave way to the need by successive Presidents to use the Council as a means of controlling and managing competing departments .The structure and functioning of the NSC depended in no small degree upon the interpersonal chemistry between the President and his principal advisers and department heads .But despite the relationships between individuals , a satisfactory organizational structure had to be developed , for without it the necessary flow of information and implementation of decisions could not occur .Although a permanent staff gradually began to take shape , the main substantive work occurred in the departments .President Truman 's NSC was dominated by the Department of State .President Eisenhower 's predilection for the military staff system , however , led to development of the NSC along those lines .The NSC staff coordinated an elaborate structure for monitoring the implementation of policies .The NSC 's Executive Secretary became an assistant to the President , but was sufficiently self - effacing not to conflict with a powerful Secretary of State , John Foster Dulles .President Kennedy may have initially looked to a strong Secretary of State to take charge of foreign policy - making , but turned to other strategies when it became apparent that the Department of State did not have sufficient authority over other departments .Kennedy , who preferred policy - making with ad hoc groups , dismantled Eisenhower 's elaborate NSC machinery and allowed the Special Assistant for National Security Affairs and his staff to assume the primary coordination role .Kennedy 's freewheeling style tended to erase the distinction between policy - making and operations that President Eisenhower 's regimented staff system so carefully observed .Sharing Kennedy 's affinity for informal advisory arrangements , President Johnson let the NSC structure atrophy still further and , like his predecessor , relied instead on the National Security Adviser and his staff and various ad hoc groups and trusted friends .But he also consulted regularly with his Tuesday Lunch Group and in 1966 officially turned over responsibility for the supervision and coordination of interdepartmental activities overseas to the Secretary of State , with mixed results .Under Presidents Nixon and Ford , Henry Kissinger 's expanded NSC staff concentrated on acquiring analytical information from the various departments that would allow the National Security Adviser to put before the President the best possible range of options for decision .This system was in perfect accord with President Nixon 's preference for detailed written expositions rather than interpersonal groupings .Kissinger concentrated on a handful of major issues and allowed some foreign matters to devolve by default on the Department of State , while weapons and international financial questions were dealt with by the Departments of Defense and the Treasury .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.13165"}

{"text": "Intelligence Support to Policymakers .Efforts to strengthen intelligence support to policymakers have a long history .Every administration seems to reach its own modus vivendi , squaring expectations with realities between the policy and intelligence communities .As in the creation of the Sit Room itself , postcrisis evaluations often are catalysts for change .Many adjustments in organization , process , and personnel have been made over the years in response to the problems perceived at the time .We describe below a model that was used successfully in the late 1980s to strengthen intelligence support at the NSC Senior Director and Interagency Working Group level .In the late 1980s , the connectivity of the Sit Room to the NSC staff benefited from the assignment of several regional and functional intelligence analysts to the Sit Room staff .These analysts worked for the Sit Room Director but had offices in the OEOB and were assigned to the NSC 's regional and functional directorates .Their job was to provide tailored current intelligence support to the staff and to serve as a focal point for Sit Room support in the directorates .Though a recent casualty of personnel cutbacks , this approach was developed after several years of trial and error focused on improving internal and external intelligence support for the National Security Adviser and the NSC staff .Use of intelligence analysts to provide daily intelligence augmentation to NSC directorates was previously considered necessary to keep up with even the normal volume of relevant intelligence and cable traffic .At the same time , resulting from their close association with the policy staff , intelligence analysts also garnered an insider 's perspective on interagency policy deliberations .This perspective strengthened the Sit Room 's ability to anticipate specific intelligence requirements .During crises , the Senior Director would have a familiar face who would coordinate intelligence support in the Sit Room and who would know where to find key information in the IC .In turn , the Sit Room Watch Team would be augmented by appropriate functional or regional expertise from an intelligence analyst familiar with current interagency policy deliberations .It proved on many occasions to be a useful marriage .Use of on - scene intelligence analysts was also a valuable means for the IC to enhance its support to the White House .With insights gained through daily interaction with the NSC directors , the analysts communicated the precise current needs of the directorates to the IC 's production elements .The analysts served as a soundingboard for IC - initiated studies and would discuss with NSC directors the gist of draft or just - published studies , often resulting in requests for deskside briefings .Finally , the analysts were responsible for framing the bulk of the issues included in the Sit Room 's Weekly Emphasis List , which was often exchanged with other agencies .Again , it is important not to confuse the role of the Sit Room Watch Team or intelligence analysts with the role of other , more senior players in the interagency intelligence process .The interagency process includes National Intelligence Officers ( NIOs ) , who are responsible for coordinating the preparation and adjudication of formal interagency National Intelligence Estimates in support of the policy community .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.4953"}

{"text": "The function of the NSC as outlined in the 1947 act was to advise the President on integration of domestic , foreign , and military policies relating to national security and to facilitate interagency cooperation .At the President 's direction , the NSC could also assess and appraise risks to U.S. national security , consider policies , and then report or make recommendations to the President .The act created a small permanent staff headed by a civilian Executive Secretary appointed by the President .In neither the National Security Act of 1947 nor subsequent amendments was there provision for the position of National Security Adviser .Initially , the permanent NSC staff had no substantive role in the formulation , let alone implementation , of national security policies .The NSC did , however , serve other purposes beyond its stated goal of advising on policy formulation .For Forrestal and the Navy , who were opposed to a strongly - unified Department of Defense , it provided top - level coordination of the three armed services without integration or unification .For Defense officials , it ensured a continuing military voice in formulation of related foreign and domestic policies during peacetime .For those , especially in Congress , who doubted Truman had adequate experience in foreign affairs or even doubted his abilities in general , the NSC offered the hope of evolving into a collegial policy - making body to reinforce the President .Truman was clearly sensitive to this implied criticism and jealous of his prerogatives as Chief Executive .He did not like the idea of Congress legislating who could advise him on national security .Truman , therefore , kept the NSC at arm 's length during its first 3 years .He attended the first session of the NSC on September 26 , 1947 , and then stayed away from all but 10 of the next 55 meetings .Truman continued to rely on a succession of personal White House advisers ( George M. Elsey , Rear Admiral Robert Dennison , and W. Averell Harriman(to coordinate for him major foreign policy matters .Initially , Truman named the Secretary of State as the ranking member of the Council in his absence and expected the Department of State to play the major role in formulating policy recommendations .This decision disappointed Defense officials who hoped that the Secretary of Defense would be allowed to preside in the President 's absence and had offered to locate the NSC staff in the Pentagon .Clifford managed to resist Secretary of Defense Forrestal 's efforts to gain control of the NSC .During its initial years , the NSC suffered from haphazard staffing and irregular meetings and was sometimes bypassed entirely .The executive secretaries of the Council had no real authority or influence beyond managing the staff process .In 1949 , the NSC was reorganized .NSC standing committees were created to deal with sensitive issues such as internal security .Even Truman 's overhaul of the machinery in 1949 did not create a National Security Council that fulfilled the role originally envisioned .Truman was partly to blame .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.283875"}
{"text": "\" The third is to associate as many prominent members of the population , especially those who have engaged in non - violent action , with the government .This last technique is known in America as co - optation and is described ... as drowning the revolution in baby 's milk \" ( Kitson , p. 87 - 88 ) .Concessions can include , for example , the promise to hold inquiries or special commissions into grievances , the transfer or removal of certain officials , allocation of funding to some government program or department , a revision of minor laws , etc . .In response to the rebellions of the 1960s , blacks , Chicanos and women also began to be promoted to higher - profile government & corporate positions , as well as police forces ( neo - colonialism ) .In the early 1970s , US military forces also began withdrawing from Vietnam .All of these are examples of concessions , reforms , and co - optation .According to Kitson , \" Prosperity is itself a potent weapon , \" ( p. 50 ) and he recommends the use of money as a means of pacifying a population & neutralizing the ability of insurgents to organize .This includes improvements in housing & infrastructure , for example , which if neglected can be exploited by subversives as proof of government neglect & incompetence .One example of this is the ' New Villages ' program used during the Malayan Emergency , which provided impoverished squatters located in remote jungle regions with new housing .On a broader level , government welfare & social services are also forms of prosperity designed to pacify social sectors and integrate them into the system .Along with the use of co - optation & concessions , Kitson also warns against repressing a ' non - violent ' movement if this only serves to deepen the insurgency : .\" It may be disadvantageous to destroy a non - violent subversive movement if the only result is to find that a campaign of terrorism or all - out insurrection has been substituted for it .It is far easier to penetrate a subversive movement [ which uses ] non - violent means than it is when the movement is wholly clandestine because of the number of people overtly involved .In some cases from the 1970s & ' 80s urban guerrilla phase in N. America , police - intelligence agents observed ' clandestine ' groups for weeks or even months as they planned , prepared and at times even carried out armed attacks .Rather than simply arrest the first group , it would be put under surveillance in order to gather more suspects & intelligence , or evidence for charges .As well , the capture & destruction of armed groups was frequently designed to maximize demoralization of the movement itself ( i.e. , by involving infiltrators & informants in the arrest & imprisonment of militants ) .If the government is unable to destroy the movement during this second phase , and it moves into that of armed insurgency , the government is faced with a far more difficult problem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.29107"}

{"text": "It is in this early stage that resistance movements should be targeted by security forces : . \" Subversive movements are particularly vulnerable during the period when the population is being organized to produce support \" ( Kitson , p. 32 ) .\" The first step should be to prevent the insurgents from gaining an ascendancy over the civil population , and in particular to disrupt his efforts at establishing his political organization .In practise , if the government is at all slow in developing a system for identifying the insurgents they will probably survive long enough to attract the support of a significant portion of the population , and if this happens the government 's task will become immeasurably harder .But if the government builds up a really effective intelligence organization quickly , insurgents operating without the insulation provided by a closely linked system of secure cells will be eliminated before they become dangerous \" ( Kitson , p. 39 ) .Because an organization does not at first experience obvious repression does not mean that counter - insurgency operations are not being carried out ( remember the principle of permanent counter - insurgency ) .The single most important resource for state security forces is intelligence , especially the identification of movement members & organizers .This intelligence is gathered through surveillance , informants & infiltrators .A movement in the beginning stages of organizing tends to be ignorant of counter - insurgency techniques .Individuals are hesitant to use any security precautions , so as to not appear ' paranoid ' .They may talk openly about subversive plans , activities , & other people .For these reasons , police - intelligence agencies take great care during this first initial phase to limit repression in order to exploit the lack of security .Their most essential task is to identify organizers , members , resources , strategies , etc .Once repression or surveillance is detected , this free flow of information can stop .In countering a growing resistance movement , Kitson advises that the state not simply openly repress the movement .Instead , it should attempt to undermine the movement through ideology & psychological warfare : . \" This policy [ of psychological operations ] has to be turned into specific propaganda material such as films , broadcasts , newspaper articles , leaflets , and so on \" ( Kitson , p. 77 ) .It is only necessary to stress once again that wars of subversion & counter - subversion are fought , in the last resort , in the minds of the people , for the importance of a good psychological operations organization to become apparent \" ( Kitson , p. 78 ) .In the second phase of insurgency , the \" non - violent phase \" as Kitson describes it , the resistance movement expands & begins carrying out larger activities such as protests , campaigns of civil disobedience , blockades , occupations , sabotage & direct action , etc . .The basic counter - insurgency techniques used up to this point continue and expand to include active disruption & harassment , arrests , imprisonment , violent assaults , and even lethal force .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.35262"}

{"text": "\" The memorial asserts that these lives were lost for a great cause , and by quoting the Gettysburg Address , it connects their sacrifice to that of soldiers who fought to preserve not just some idea of Americanism , but the union itself .The remake turns patriotic tragedy into personal tragedy - Jed is killed just at the moment when he has reconciled with his brother .Toni ( Adrianne Palicki in the remake , Jennifer Grey in the original ) and Matt both survive in this version , along with many of the other Wolverines .Well , the white Wolverines .The new Red Dawn is n't just a yellow peril movie , it 's a vision of white supremacy .Only one nonwhite Wolverine has much of an identity ( Daryl , played by Connor Cruise ) , and the others die pretty quickly .Finally , Daryl is , without his knowledge , injected with some sort of tracking device that ca n't be removed from his body , so he 's given some supplies and left to wander away , probably to be killed by the North Koreans .Almost all of the white Wolverines survive , presumably with a new understanding of the miraculous powers of their skin color .Remember what happened to ( white ) Daryl in 1984 ?His sleazy father ( the mayor ) forced him to swallow a tracking device .He knew it was in him .After barely surviving the assault that followed , the Wolverines take him to the top of a freezing mesa with a captured Russian soldier and get ready to execute him .Jed and Matt fight about it , with Matt saying it will make them worse than the Russians .Jed kills the Soviet soldier , but does n't seem to be able to kill Daryl .Robert , whose experiences have fully brutalized him , shoots Daryl .It 's a wrenching , disturbing scene .The new Red Dawn does n't hurt .It 's superficially entertaining in a way that the original is not .Sure , it 's shocking that Jed dies , but the way that scene is set up and edited highlights the shock , not the pain .In the original Red Dawn , Jed and Matt know they 're heading out on a suicide mission .Jed survives a little while longer only because the Cuban Colonel Bella ( Ron O'Neal ) feels some respect or sympathy for him and is tired of the whole war .Jed1984 kills the Super Nasty Russian Bad Guy , just as Jed2012 kills Capt .Joe ( with his father 's gun , because they just happen to be in Dad 's Police Station ! ) , but the original film then takes the brothers to a frozen park , where , mortally wounded , they sit together on a bench and drift off to eternity .The new Red Dawn instead puts its concluding weight on the idea that you probably should n't trust the black guy , even if he 's friendly and well - intentioned .He 's probably got a tracking device in his blood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.04766"}

{"text": "In turn , the Sit Room Watch Team would be augmented by appropriate functional or regional expertise from an intelligence analyst familiar with current interagency policy deliberations .It proved on many occasions to be a useful marriage .Use of on - scene intelligence analysts was also a valuable means for the IC to enhance its support to the White House .With insights gained through daily interaction with the NSC directors , the analysts communicated the precise current needs of the directorates to the IC 's production elements .The analysts served as a soundingboard for IC - initiated studies and would discuss with NSC directors the gist of draft or just - published studies , often resulting in requests for deskside briefings .Finally , the analysts were responsible for framing the bulk of the issues included in the Sit Room 's Weekly Emphasis List , which was often exchanged with other agencies .Again , it is important not to confuse the role of the Sit Room Watch Team or intelligence analysts with the role of other , more senior players in the interagency intelligence process .The interagency process includes National Intelligence Officers ( NIOs ) , who are responsible for coordinating the preparation and adjudication of formal interagency National Intelligence Estimates in support of the policy community .NIOs are often included in senior - level interagency meetings and provide feedback and tasking to the IC .Whereas the NIO is focused on future ( although sometimes near - term ) requirements for collection , production , and analysis , the Sit Room analyst was focused on ensuring access to today 's information already available in the Community , and on effecting close coordination at the working level .Interagency Connections .In addition to providing current intelligence support to the NSC staff in important regional and functional areas , the Sit Room has a more independent role to play as an operations and intelligence center .There is a constant need for daily coordination on current issues with other centers , especially at the Defense and State Departments and CIA .This coordination takes place largely out of view of the NSC staff and leadership , but is nonetheless critical to the effectiveness of the interagency system .Sit Room responsibilities sometimes extend beyond intelligence and national security functions .Comparisons With Other Washington - Area Centers .Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of the Sit Room is its proximity to the President .As in real estate , the operative principles are location , location , and location .To be sure , the President gets most important intelligence advice and inputs from the Director of Central Intelligence , NIOs , and other key officials .But these officials can not be at the White House 24 hours a day .The Sit Room often is the \" first phone call \" when senior White House officials are looking for the latest intelligence information , and it plays a key role in synthesizing cables and intelligence products originated by other agencies .A second feature is that the Sit Room is both an operations and intelligence center for the White House .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.74652"}

{"text": "However , many have turned against the current administration , and to some extent , against government in general .They affirm core American values of freedom and individuality , but in the service of tearing down , without a vision of what to create .This is one half of an ideology , the against part , without a clear aim , a for part .Such rebellion seems to be supported , and perhaps instigated , by people in the background who finance it , and by politicized media .It thrives on people 's genuine and understandable distress , the result of the frustration of material needs , but even more , the frustration of a variety of psychological needs , uncertainty , and fear .Joining ideological groups and movements helps fulfill needs for security , community , and a feeling of effectiveness at a time when people feel powerless .The law is based on reasoned analysis , devoid of ideological biases or unconscious influences .Judges frame their decisions as straightforward applications of an established set of legal doctrines , principles , and mandates to a given set of facts .Or so we think .As the Supreme Court debates President Barack Obama 's landmark health care law - sometimes dubbed ObamaCare - it 's important to remember that unreasoned , impartial law is largely an illusion .What sparked your interest in the study of mind sciences and the law ?My interest has evolved through several stages .Although I studied economics in college , I did so with special interest in health care policy , where the life - and - death decisions have little in common with the consumption choices imagined in neoclassical economics .Purchasing an appendectomy through insurance has little in common with buying a fruit at the market .Those experiences strengthened my doubts regarding the real - world relevance of basic economic models for certain types of decisions .In law school , I studied law and economics , but tended to focus on informational problems and externalities that had been given short shrift by some legal economists at the time .After attending a talk by , and then meeting with , the late Amos Tversky , I became an early fan of the nascent behavioral economics movement .What was it about the cigarette documents that had that effect ?Well , they made clear that the tobacco industry articulated two views of their consumers - an inaccurate public portrayal , and a more accurate private view .The first , which the industry conveyed to their consumers and to lawmakers , was of smokers who are independent , rational , and deliberate .Smokers smoke cigarettes because they choose to , because smoking makes them happier , even considering the risks .The industry thus gave consumers a flattering view of themselves as autonomous , liberated actors while assuring would - be regulators that there was no need to be concerned about the harmful consequences of smoking .Smokers were , after all , just getting what they wanted .The second view of the consumer , which was evident in the industry 's internal documents , was of consumers as irrational , malleable , and manipulable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.80456"}

{"text": "Vance felt that Brzezinski 's linkage of SALT to other Soviet activities and the MX , together with the growing domestic criticisms in the United States of the SALT II Accord , convinced Brezhnev to decide on military intervention in Afghanistan .Brzezinski , however , later recounted that he advanced proposals to maintain Afghanistan 's \" independence \" but was frustrated by the Department of State 's opposition .An NSC working group on Afghanistan wrote several reports on the deteriorating situation in 1979 , but President Carter ignored them until the Soviet intervention destroyed his illusions .Only then did he decide to abandon SALT II ratification and pursue the anti - Soviet policies that Brzezinski proposed .The Iranian revolution provided the coup de grace to the disintegrating Vance(Brzezinski relationship .As the upheaval developed , the two advanced fundamentally different positions .Brzezinski wanted to control the revolution and increasingly suggested military action to prevent Khomeini from coming to power , while Vance wanted to come to terms with the new Khomeini regime .As a consequence Carter failed to develop a coherent approach to the Iranian situation .Brzezinski continued , however , to promote his views , which the President eventually accepted .Vance 's resignation following the unsuccessful mission undertaken over his objections to rescue the American hostages in March 1980 was the final result of the deep disagreement between Brzezinki and Vance .The Reagan administration , like its predecessors , faced the recurring dilemma of determining which official or agency would have primary responsibility for the direction , control , and supervision of U.S. foreign policy .During the 1980 campaign , Ronald Reagan pledged to downgrade the post of National Security Adviser in order to end the rivalry between the NSC and the Department of State that had plagued previous administrations .On inauguration day , Secretary of State - designate Alexander Haig presented a draft National Security Decision Directive ( NSDD ) on the organization of U.S. foreign policy to Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese III .The intent of Haig 's draft was to place overall responsibility for the direction and implementation of U.S. foreign policy within the Department of State .Relying on his experience in the Nixon administration , Haig wanted to ensure Department of State control of the interagency groups within the NSC because they were the \" key [ to ] the flow of options to the President , \" and thus to policy control .Haig 's initiative , which he repeated on several occasions , was never responded to .Although the Haig initiative failed , the Secretary of State appeared to achieve for a time broad authority over the formulation of foreign policy .The President placed National Security Adviser Richard Allen 's office under the supervision of Meese , and for the first time in the history of the NSC , the National Security Adviser lost direct access to the President .In subsequent public statements , the President underlined his belief that his Secretary of State was his \" primary adviser on foreign affairs , and in that capacity , he is the chief formulator and spokesman for foreign policy for this administration .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.95671"}

{"text": "If it really was Jonathan Davis , he did an incredible job .I have n't read ( or listened to ) a Star Wars book in a long time , but this one sounded interesting .One reviewer described it like the 1985 Clint Eastwood movie \" Pale Rider \" , and I agree .It was essentially a Western and not a typical Star Wars science fiction book .No space travel or big starship battles .It was n't \" the future of the universe turns on these events \" kind of story .Instead it was a rather small , intimate story set on Tatooine right after Obi - Wan Kenobi ( now going by Ben Kenobi ) drops off the baby Luke Skywalker with his aunt & uncle .Ben Kenobi tries to settle into a hermit 's life near a small settlement , trying not to draw attention to himself or reveal himself as a Jedi Knight ( which would draw the Empire 's attention to him and Luke ) .But of course there are attacks by Tusken Raiders , bad guys to deal with , the harsh conditions of Tatooine itself , and a little romantic tension thrown in .Caring for people and righting wrongs while remaining as aloof and as anonymous as possible are Ben 's challenges .It was a nice change of pace for a Star Wars story .Would you consider the audio edition of Kenobi to be better than the print version ?The Star Wars audiobooks narrated by Marc Thompson and Jonathan Davis are always fantastic .Their voices capture the different characters and species amazingly well through out the whole performance .Music and sound affects from the movies is provided at appropiate places complimenting the fantastic storyline .Jonathan Davis does a true credit to Obi - wan but his performance as the antagonist Oran Galt resonates .Preception of Galt slowly sifts throughout the novel and Davis carries this remarkaly well so that even as Galt 's character shifts you see the traces of the person he once was , is precieved to be and the villan he becomes .Obi - wan 's strength and moral intergrity .There are too few books that do true credit to the character of Obi - wan Kenobi .Even in the movies his story is shadowed by another .In Episode I he is the apprentice to a great Jedi Master .In Episode II and III while a Master in his own right he is overshadowed by Anakin 's deeds and powers , and the audience is enraptured by Anakin decline .Respected throughout the Jedi Order , Obi - wan is considered the ultimate Jedi , one who embodied all a Jedi is supposed to be .Star Wars Kenobi caputres that core essence of who he is and provides reasonable explanations for how the Ewan McGregor character evolved into the cray wizard and hermit Alec Guinness supposedly is when first introduced at the begining of a A New Hope .At the end of Episode III , Obi - Wan Kenobi is forced into hiding after believing that he killed Anakin in their confrontation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.338776"}
{"text": "Therefore , he 's the only one who could defeat him .The answer to this question is therefore the same as the Revan vs Nihilus thread : Using his super - drain thingy , Nihilus wipes the floor with his opponent .End of story .Nihilus would win , despite how much I dislike him .There 's no reason why Anakin would survive .Is it stupid ?Yes .But that 's TSL .Where you can hit a guy with a lightsaber a hundred times and he wo n't die because he 's just that angry .As for who would win between Anakin/ Vader and Nihilus ?I would say Nihilus , because he feeds on the force , and fighting someone who was made up of the force , would be a feast for Nihilus .Firstly nihilus does NOT feed on the force , he merely kills his victims and feeds on the death he has caused .Kreia herself stated this so no , he does not \" feed on the force \" .Secondly nihilus destroys the force bond between his victim and the force which the victim dies instantly according to kreia .Although I think Anakin/ Vader is cooler , Nihilus would destroy him .Only the Exile is capable of defeating Nihilus , since he/ she was a wound in the force .And where was it stated that only the exile could defeat him ?Who said you had to be a \" wound in the force \" to defeat nihilus ?Have you ever heard of the fallanasi technique ?One which allows the user to remove himself from the force and mask his force bond completely which would not allow nihilus to drain him , cut him off the force or feed on him in any way ?There from two different mediums , you 'd have to put Nihilus in a film or Anakin in a game not based on the movie depictions of power to get a real answer .Judging by your posts , I can tell you skipped through all the dialogue .If not , you would have known only a wound in the force can defeat him .As for that other stuff you stated I am not familiar with it , since I do n't read any of that EU stuff .The only EU I know is the KOTOR games .Actually as far as the Yuzon Vong , he has a point .They are a whole race of aliens with no presence in the force whatsoever , so an ability that feeds on their life force through their connection to the force would be irrelevant to them .He 'd be trying to feed on something that just was n't there .As to whether a technique to mask one 's connection to the force would make force powers that drain one of the force , would be the same thing , that 's highly speculative , and I could see an arguement either way on that .As to the rest of what you say , you 're pretty much dead on though .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.37372"}

{"text": "To say more would spoil things .Overall , it is worth checking out , so I do n't want to give too much away .As is my custom , I consumed this as an audiobook .As has been the case of late , the audio production is superb , and Johnathan Davis , as I 've come to expect , does an excellent job bringing these characters to life .He is especially convincing as Kenobi - an iconic voice well known thanks to Ewan MacGregor and James Arnold Taylor 's portrayals in the movies and Clone Wars TV series .Davis picks up Kenobi 's voice and mannerisms seemlessly and probably makes me give this story it 's fourth star when I might have been inclined to just give it three .For the die hard Star Wars fan , yes .But for the casual fan , I would recommend ' Darth Plagueis ' instead .While the narration was well done and the story well written , there was nothing extraordinary about it .I found nothing revelational about this particular story of Ben ( Obi Wan ) Kenobi 's residency on Tatooine .I expected maybe a revelation that Darth Vader ( a.k.a .Anakin Skwalker ) had survived their epic encounter or maybe a mentioning of atrocities committed by the newly formed Empire .But , there was hardly a mentioning except regarding known events that occurred in Episode III .We hear his one sided conversations with Qui Gon Jinn , but do n't hear his former master 's reply .Ben is there to keep vigil while Luke Skywalker grows up , but is evidently doing so at a distance .This story also conveys that Obi Wan is for the most part in an information vacuum in the outer rim on Tatooine .And the story makes it pretty obvious that the will of the Force is to make sure that Ben 's true identity as a Jedi Knight is kept a secret , no matter how much trouble he finds himself in .What does Jonathan Davis bring to the story that you would n't experience if you just read the book ?Jonathan Davis does a fantastic job of pacing the story as well as varying up the voices enough that you know who is speaking without having to hear or read \" Said , such and such character .\" The sound effects and music that accompany his narration of Star Wars audio books also lends to the telling of the story .Great Character driven scenes and John Jackson Miller makes Tattooine shine brighter than its two suns .For the past years , Jonathan Davis has always been the perfect for Kenobi ; he gets better every time !If it was n't for the superb narration by Johnathan Davis , I would have scored this audio book much lower .I can imagine if anyone bought the e - book or paperback version of this story they would have been pretty bored .Johnathan does a great job keeping you engaged and breathed life into an otherwise C- book .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.43327"}

{"text": "The strength of both writing and narration allow one to simply get sucked in and see it play out on the movie screen of the mind .Perhaps I 'm a bit biased , but that 's what happens for me when Star Wars returns to its roots within the scope of the film saga and finally expands out our understanding of one of its central characters .While technically a stand - alone adventure , the very nature of the story is that it requires a familiarity with the films to fully appreciate it .But then , if you 're not already a fan , why would you be reading this book ?As one who is a little more deeply entrenched into the EU , I can say without really spoiling anything about the plot that canon cops are going to be screaming over the rather important reference to Sharad Hett .If you do n't know who that is , do n't worry - it gets explained , and it works within the scope of the story well .There 's just that one tiny point that will irk the diehards specifically because of how woven it is into the backstory .For myself , I do n't let it bother me .I found it to be a rather cool nod to an early prequel era comic , and let 's be honest here : neither the novels nor the comics are actually canon .Forget this \" layers of canon \" nonsense , because Star Wars is the only franchise where the younger fans have n't figured it out yet .Regardless ... it 's a non - issue to the plot of this story .I will simply say this instead , that much like with Darth Plagueis , this book should probably be elevated to a higher level closer to the canon of the films because of the material it does cover .What IS an issue to the plot of this story is an inside look at the culture of the sand people .As with other appearances of this race here and there throughout the EU , they are suitably creepy and fearsome , and it 's a treat for this fan to get a story revolving around them .One tiny personal disappointment I do have , and this is a bit of a character spoiler , but not a plot spoiler , is that Kenobi at no time learns that Darth Vader is still alive .I was hoping to have this scene , but perhaps they 'll leave that for another story .There is no Vader in this story ; it 's Kenobi - centric , and all that implies .Tatooine is remote , after all , and the news travels slowly .A sense of how slowly is depicted here .To make up for that tiny little disappointment , what we 're given is a range of characters , most of them moisture farmers , who are actually interesting .These characters are so well written that you come to care for their plight in short order , which connects you to Kenobi as he fights his instincts to get involved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.108215"}

{"text": "Military action , in fact , may be severely limited due to an inability to locate insurgents and/or the need to not further alienate a domestic population .For these reasons , it is also referred to as low - intensity conflict ( in many cases , however , this has involved widespread state terror against domestic populations , more accurately termed counter - insurgency wars ) .In a broader social sense , the ruling class sees the domestic population as a hostile & threatening force , which must be constantly watched in case subversive elements within it begin to organize & spread .Permanent counter - insurgency exists because the state understands that , although rebel organizations can be destroyed , the conditions which give rise to such movements can not , due to the inherent oppression & injustice of the system itself .For this reason , intelligence agencies are maintained whose purpose is to identify & monitor subversive persons & elements within the domestic population .Current examples include the Canadian Security & Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) , the RCMP 's Integrated National Security Enforcement Team ( INSET ) , the US Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , as well as intelligence & national security sections within police & military forces .The foundation of all counter - insurgency operations is intelligence gained from surveillance & spies .Without this intelligence , state security forces would not know who , what , where , or when to strike .This surveillance not only targets individuals , but functions at a social level as well , identifying patterns & trends in specific social sectors ( i.e. , ethnic , economic , tribal , geographic , etc . ) .Just as insurgency can not exist without substantial support from the population , counter - insurgency can not function without extending its repression & surveillance throughout the society .In both cases , it is the people who can be seen as the final determining factor between liberation & oppression .Liberation based on , as George Jackson termed it , \" the greater potential violence of the masses , \" versus that of the state .If successful , the state maintains its system of oppression and yet can never claim a final victory , as the process of repression & resistance again renews itself with each new generation .In the context of insurgency , this greater potential violence is not simply military , but includes all measures which decrease the military potential of our enemy ( i.e. , strikes , boycotts , demonstrations , blockades , occupations , riots , sabotage ) .Guerrilla Warfare & Insurgency .Guerrilla is a Spanish word meaning \" little war . \"Guerrilla warfare is used by a smaller , weaker force against a larger , more powerful enemy .Today , it is also referred to as ' asymmetrical warfare ' , although it is an ancient form of warfare .Guerrilla warfare seeks to avoid enemy strengths and to attack critical enemy vulnerabilities , relying on secrecy , surprise , stealth , & speed .Ambushes and raids are common tactics , as well as sabotage of critical infrastructure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.01949"}

{"text": "Red Dawn Remake : Why ?The original Red Dawn is easily one of the worst movies ever made ; Patrick Swayze 's presence alone all but guarantees that .So why in the world would anyone want to see a remake that is bound to be even worse , if only because of the patently absurd idea that North Korea , for crying out loud , is going to invade America , is beyond me .David Axe has already dubbed it the dumbest movie ever .Where the 1984 original successfully played upon widespread public fears over a supposedly rising and belligerent Soviet Union , the remake expects viewers to take North Korea seriously as an existential threat .We 're guessing the flick is going to get a lot of unintended laughs .You see , the actual North Korea is a country of 24 million people with a GDP roughly equal to North Dakota 's .It 's an impoverished , even starving , prison state that lacks modern weaponry and any ability to deploy forces globally .If preview clips posted this weekend are any indication , the movie magically gifts North Korea with a huge fleet of long - range transport planes ... because it has to .Of course , how these planes get past the U.S. military 's 3,000 jet fighters is anyone 's guess .The new Red Dawn has been sitting on the shelf for a couple years owing to financing troubles and at least one major revamp by screenwriters Carl Elsworth and Jeremy Passmore .As originally written , the relaunched Red Dawn was only slightly less silly .The bad guys were Chinese .And while China has no discernible intention of invading anyone , much less the U.S. , Beijing at least commands a $ 7.3-trillion economy and an increasingly modern , two - million - man army .But it 's bad business to portray one of the world 's fastest growing film markets as brutal world conquerors , so the producers swapped in North Korea , a country no one counts on for ticket sales .After spending several years touring the country as a stand up comedian , Ed Brayton tired of explaining his jokes to small groups of dazed illiterates and turned to writing as the most common outlet for the voices in his head .He has appeared on the Rachel Maddow Show and the Thom Hartmann Show , and is almost certain that he is the only person ever to make fun of Chuck Norris on C - SPAN .David Axe asserts : .Where the 1984 original successfully played upon widespread public fears over a supposedly rising and belligerent Soviet Union .I do n't recall such fears in terms of an invasionary force like Red Dawn portrayed .Where at 24 in 1984 , I was a prime demographic target .That lack of fear largely contributed to it being a dumb movie back then .The original movie did play well in inspiring rural high school jocks to fantasize that their athletic and hunting skills made them superior warriors relative to other countries ' soldiers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.84332"}
{"text": "The experiences of the 1950s black civil rights struggle in the US , as well the 1960 's & ' 70s period of liberation struggles , stand as historical records of such tactics .During this time , social movements in North America had developed into the second stage of insurgency ( according to Kitson 's model ) .This included mass civil disobedience , protests , direct actions , & sabotage .Key organizers were killed or arrested , widespread surveillance was conducted , offices & homes were broken into , material and resources were stolen or destroyed , and scores of informants & infiltrators used .By the late 1960s , thousands of National Guard and US Army soldiers were being deployed in major cities to crush ghetto riots & rebellions .Many movement members & especially organizers had been assassinated , with many others imprisoned .Faced with lethal repression , their public organizations heavily infiltrated and now incapacitated , some militants went ' underground ' to escape death or capture .At this time , many movements began to see armed guerrilla groups emerge .These included the Black Liberation Army , the Puerto Rican FALN ( Armed Forces of National Liberation ) , the Symbionese Liberation Army , Weather Underground , and later the George Jackson Brigade .They carried out bombings , arson , jail breaks , armed robberies , and armed attacks against police & military targets ( especially the BLA & FALN ) .Many were captured or killed by the late ' 70s .By this time , the FBI 's COINTEL - PRO had been terminated and replaced by anti - terrorism as the guiding doctrine for what was still counter - insurgency .In Canada , Martial Law was declared after FLQ ( Quebec Liberation Front ) guerrillas kidnapped two politicians in Quebec ( later executing one - the October Crisis , 1970 ) .Soldiers were deployed in Montreal and 450 people detained in raids & arrests .Throughout the 1960 's & ' 70s , the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) Security Service , like the FBI , also carried out counter - insurgency operations involving widespread surveillance , break - and - enters , theft of files , arson , etc .In fact , the Security Service was eventually disbanded after revelations of its ' illegal ' activities , and was replaced by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) .Although the urban guerrillas were quickly crushed for the most part , many social movements during the 1960s and ' 70s were clearly insurgent in their views .This was due in part to the courageous resistance of the Vietnamese people and a global wave of rebellion ( the ' 68 generation ) .Regarding counter - insurgency strategies for this second phase , Kitson advises : . \" In practical terms the most promising line of approach lies in separating the mass of those engaged in the campaign from the leadership by the promise of concessions ...It is most important to do 3 things quickly .\" The first is to implement the promised concessions so as to avoid allegations of bad faith which may enable the subversive leadership to regain control over sections of the people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.99255"}

{"text": "In fact , almost every successful insurgency in history has won by avoiding decisive engagement until they had weakened the regular forces to the point where they could win .The best example of this was Wendell Fertig 's insurgency in the Philippines against the Japanese during WWII .Fertig deliberately avoided engagements with Japanese troops in division , brigade or battalion strength , but as his guerillas continued to withdraw , the Japanese were forced to spread their forces into smaller and smaller units , which made them vulnerable to attack at the squad and platoon level .Eventually , the Japanese retreated to base clusters and a stalemate ensued ( although Fertig 's people continued to grow stronger while the Japanese were unable to increase their footprint ) until MacArthur 's return with overwhelming American conventional forces .The small arms that the Philippinos had prior to the war and those kept by Americans who did n't surrender proved decisive in protecting the first elements of Fertig 's force .The Second Amendment is n't there to guarantee our rights , although it does , it is there to remind those who would try to impose their will upon us that there are tens of millions of potential insurgents who will resist tyranny .This is also why no enemy would be successful in invading our country .Movies like the 2 Red Dawn 's were a tad unrealistic as they portrayed the American citizenry as submissive with the exception of a group of high school students .If an enemy like North Korea had the nads to invade , the only place they could secure would be California and even that 's iffy because I 'd be surprised if those heavily armed street gangs were so submissive to an invading force .This is the reason why the left and the leftist world hates us because unlike them , if we 're invaded , we 'll fight back as well as our military .China has a large army ?Bring it on because along with the military , we have about 30 million armed citizens to chip in .I mentioned this in another group , but the Las Vegas local news actually ran a segment on the popularity of smart phone dating apps that usually offer no more then a quick hook up which can result in ... Insurgency & Counter - Insurgency .Insurgency is an organized revolt against a government or foreign occupation force .It is a mass movement arising from the civilian or Indigenous populations as a whole .Although insurgencies involve the organization of combat forces ( usually guerrillas ) , these forces would be quickly isolated & destroyed without support from the population .Insurgency is the only form of warfare to have defeated two super - powers : the US in Vietnam ( 1962 - 73 ) and the Russians in Afghanistan ( 1979 - 89 ) .Counter - insurgency is a special form of warfare against resistance movements & populations as a whole .It involves all the means used to wage war , including diplomacy , terror , ideology , culture , psychological , economic , political , and military means .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.97727"}

{"text": "Mao 's theory was that guerrilla forces should be organized in the rural areas , where the government had less control and was often unable to rely on superior numbers , technology , etc .As the rural areas came increasingly under rebel control , government forces would be restricted to urban areas , which were then cut off and isolated prior to attack .Mao envisioned this occurring at an international level as well , where the imperialist nations of Europe & North America were equated with being the urban centres , while the Third Word was equated with being the rural regions .As anti - colonial & anti - imperialist forces fought and gained control of the ' rural ' areas , the imperial nations would find themselves isolated & cut off from cheap resources , markets , etc . .In Asian & African jungles & Middle - East deserts , European colonial forces were faced with growing insurgencies during the 1950s & ' 60s .In colony after colony , small guerrilla forces , supported by large sectors of the population , began carrying out armed attacks against government , military , & corporate targets .One of the first post - war anti - colonial guerrilla insurgencies began in Malaya ( now Malaysia ) .The Malayan Emergency . \"Like other conflicts , the Malayan Emergency offers lessons that have applicability to future wars .It is one of the few examples of a low - intensity conflict that was won by the government in power & thus is a favourite subject of case studies in insurgency .In addition , it stands as one of the best illustrations of a coordinated political - military effort that actually defeated a guerrilla force .( Maj .Jay Gordon Simpson , \" Not by Bombs Alone : Lessons from Malaya , \" Joint Forces Quarterly , pub . by Canadian Forces , Summer 1999 ) .Malaya is located in South - East Asia , bordered on the north by Thailand and to the south by the small city - state of Singapore .Malaya itself is a peninsula of over 50,000 square miles , with some of the world 's most rugged terrain , mountainous and heavily forested with thick jungle .Originally occupied by the British during the mid-1800s , Malaya came under Japanese occupation during WW2 .During the war , Malayan guerrilla forces were organized to fight the Japanese , and many were trained & armed by the British .After the war and the defeat of Japan , the British moved to re - occupy Malaya and to establish a neo - colonial regime .In response , former guerrillas renewed their military operations , now under the Malayan People 's Anti - British Army .This movement was led by the Malayan Communist Party , with its primary base of support among disaffected & impoverished Malayan Chinese , many of whom were landless peasants in rural areas .The insurgents began attacking British & Malayan government forces , as well as colonial businesses such as rubber plantations & tin mines ( the main export commodities ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "122.988625"}

Hoberman in the Nov / Dec 2012 issue of Film Comment . )Now , though ?The new Red Dawn comes as the Iraq war is winding down and the war in Afghanistan ( our longest ) may be nearing some sort of end .( And then , of course , there 's Libya . )But these have been wars where we have been invaders fighting insurgents .They have been long , unfocused wars with no clear victory conditions .They began with some popularity and unanimity of public opinion , but the longer they went on , and the more that people learned about them , the less popular they became .They continued because the U.S. military is , while a huge part of the national budget , not a particularly concrete and visible part of everyday life and concern for many Americans .Without the threat of a draft , and with the rise of long - distance and drone strikes , most Americans can ignore the immediate reality of American wars , the hundreds of thousands of deaths and injuries on every side .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.59825"}

{"text": "That year , the Malayan Security Service , the main intelligence branch of the British , was disbanded after failing to provide advance warning of the insurgency .It was replaced by Malayan police Special Branches .Overall , the government was slow to respond , and not until 1950 did serious effort begin to put into counter - insurgency operations .In 1951 , the British high commissioner to Malaya was assassinated by insurgents , and the counter - insurgency campaign began to intensify .Regular police & military forces were quickly found to be incapable of engaging in successful counter - insurgency operations , however .Police lacked training & equipment , while regular soldiers trained to fight conventional mechanized wars were unable to adapt to anti - guerrilla fighting .Guerrilla insurgents , operating in small groups in inaccessible mountains & jungles , were elusive & impossible to control .The lack of extensive roads , railways and airfields in Malaya severely limited the ability of government forces to locate and attack guerrillas .Using hit and run attacks on vulnerable enemy targets , the guerrilla insurgency continued to gain popular support .One response from the British was to re - establish special military commando units from WW2 .One of these was the Special Air Service ( SAS ) , who were deployed into Malaya in the 1950s to fight an anti - guerrilla war .They are seen as the prototype of today 's special forces units .Other forces deployed included regular British & Australian troops , veterans of both WW2 & Korea , as well as air force planes & helicopters .In Malaya , small SAS teams were placed in or near Indigenous villages to recruit , train and organize paramilitary forces against the guerrillas .They also gathered intelligence , established communications posts , provided medical aid to villagers , and carried out extensive small - unit patrols .According to one history of the unit , .\" The SAS found that offering medical assistance & helping the tribesmen defend themselves from the guerrillas , along with attempting to learn their language & customs , were the two primary requirements for gaining their trust .\" The SAS also performed two invaluable counter - insurgency functions in that their hearts - and - minds campaign helped deny the [ insurgents ] local support & their deep penetration denied the guerrillas a safe haven .Many precepts developed by the SAS in Malaya became standard for the SAS in later counter - insurgency campaigns , as well as for the US in Vietnam & Latin America .Perhaps most importantly , the success of the SAS in Malaya established the continued need for such special operations units . \"( SAS : Great Britain 's Elite , p. 69- 71 ) .Overall , however , \" Offensive air support was not a major factor .It was only useful against an enemy whose position was known and that intended to hold its ground .The communists preferred mobility and stealth \" ( Simpson , 1999 , p. 94 ) .Major work was required to carve out landing zones for helicopters & drop zones for supplies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "127.67339"}
{"text": "At first , the villages were under armed guard by soldiers , later replaced by paramilitary forces & police .This program is seen as achieving considerable success , and had a significant impact on the ability of the guerrilla to continue carrying out operations .The relocation effort itself succeeded because many villages were ' squatters ' , living in huts in remote villages .In the ' New Villages ' , housing and other amenities were provided , raising the material standard of their living conditions ( prosperity as a form of pacification ) .In 1957 , the British also granted Malaya independence , although retaining significant political , military , & economic control .Nevertheless , this also served to deprive the insurgents of their essential reason & purpose ( independence ) . \"An insurgency is an attempt to force political change , and thus it follows logically that the center of gravity can be reached only by political action .Again , in Malaya , the center of gravity was targeted not by jungle patrolling , but by the political decision to grant independence ; the military contribution was invaluable , but not of itself decisive .The military campaign should focus upon the insurgents , but it is only one part of a wider solution ... .\"Decisions in principle were taken to move toward independence for Malaya from 1952 onwards , and proceeded via elections in 1955 to full independence in 1957 .The effect of these political decisions was to improve the cooperation of the Malay authorities , allow the Malayan armed forces to be built up and integrated into the operations to defeat the insurgency , and to gradually isolate and neutralize the insurgents ... \" .( Gavin Bulloch , \" Military Doctrine and Counterinsurgency : A British Perspective , \" Parameters ; US Army War College Quarterly , Summer 1996 , pp .4 - 16 ) .By 1959 , the guerrillas were forced to seek sanctuary in nearby Thailand .The Malayan Emergency officially ended in 1960 , and military operations continued until 1963 .Although the insurgency was defeated in that it failed to seize power & establish a communist government & economic system , the guerrillas clearly contributed to the ending of direct British rule .Kitson 's Counter - Insurgency Model .Frank Kitson , a British military commander with extensive experience in Malaya , Borneo , Kenya , and Northern Ireland , developed many of the basic principles & methods of counter - insurgency used by Western nations today .Kitson emphasized the need to gather intelligence and to conduct psychological operations as vital to the defeat of an insurgent movement , extending far beyond simple police - military operations .In a 1971 book entitled Low Intensity Operations , Kitson states , .\" [ T]he enemy is likely to be employing a combination of political , economic , psychological and military measures , so the government will have to do likewise to defeat him ... \" .( Frank Kitson , Low Intensity Operations : Subversion , Insurgency , Peace - Keeping , Faber & Faber , London 1971 , p. 7 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "127.81789"}

{"text": "Not to mention that if this country did fall into armed civil war , a lot of the military would be on our side .How does this negate the reasoning behind limiting high capacity magizines , eliminating assult weapons , and enforcing universal background checks ?Whether a left , right , or center crazy keeping weapons of mass destruction out of their hands is a good idea ... .We 'll start with the Arizona gun store owner 's policy : If you voted for Bronco you 're too irresponsible to own a gun .I get a kick on his idea that an armed citizenry is no match for our military .While that may be true , our military is n't exactly made up by a bunch of progressives and when it comes to firing on it 's own citizens , I believe that our fighting men and women would do no such thing .Not to mention that if this country did fall into armed civil war , a lot of the military would be on our side .The Afghans and Iraqis have done quite well against our military , using assault weapons , improvised explosives and hit and run tactics .Liberals , who do n't study military history , do n't understand that resistance to tyranny does n't have to involve massive , set piece battles .In fact , almost every successful insurgency in history has won by avoiding decisive engagement until they had weakened the regular forces to the point where they could win .The best example of this was Wendell Fertig 's insurgency in the Philippines against the Japanese during WWII .Fertig deliberately avoided engagements with Japanese troops in division , brigade or battalion strength , but as his guerillas continued to withdraw , the Japanese were forced to spread their forces into smaller and smaller units , which made them vulnerable to attack at the squad and platoon level .Eventually , the Japanese retreated to base clusters and a stalemate ensued ( although Fertig 's people continued to grow stronger while the Japanese were unable to increase their footprint ) until MacArthur 's return with overwhelming American conventional forces .The small arms that the Philippinos had prior to the war and those kept by Americans who did n't surrender proved decisive in protecting the first elements of Fertig 's force .The Second Amendment is n't there to guarantee our rights , although it does , it is there to remind those who would try to impose their will upon us that there are tens of millions of potential insurgents who will resist tyranny .Those old dudes spent a whole lot of time and trouble picking their words very carefully .A big part of the reason for that is that words mean things .\" Arms \" in the parlance of the times meant guns .What you 're talking about are munitions .The Founders were not out to protect someone 's right to have artillery or munitions .If they had been , they would have said so .The Afghans and Iraqis have done quite well against our military , using assault weapons , improvised explosives and hit and run tactics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "136.43996"}
