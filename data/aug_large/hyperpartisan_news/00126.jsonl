{"text": "ACLU officials wrote that honoring the \" detainer \" requests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could put Ohio counties in danger of violating Fourth Amendment rights , which prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures without probable cause and a warrant .That could expose the sheriffs to lawsuits , said Gary Daniels , chief lobbyist for the Ohio ACLU office .\" We 're talking about a very serious constitutional violation - holding people when they have no legal authority and just because ICE made a request , \" he said .After two civil - rights rulings by federal judges this year , more than 100 counties in several states , including California , Oregon , Kansas and Pennsylvania , enacted policies to reduce or eliminate their cooperation with ICE detainers .In the past , many law - enforcement agencies considered honoring detainer requests mandatory .ICE has argued that the detainers are critical for the agency to be able to identify , and ultimately remove , illegal immigrants who fall into federal , state or local custody because of criminal activity .Law - enforcement agencies send fingerprints of anyone arrested in the U.S. to the FBI .The prints of those born outside the U.S. are then forwarded to ICE for an immigration check .ICE does not pay for the jail beds and administrative costs for immigration detainers .That should be reason enough , immigration advocates say , for county officials to stop abiding by the detainer requests .Frustrated by the high cost of housing undocumented inmates , Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones recently sent a letter to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto requesting repayment of $ 900,000 for the 3,000 Mexican nationals arrested in his county over the past decade .Jones said the number is a rough estimate based on the jail costs of an average stay of five days for each immigrant .Jones acknowledged that he does n't expect to get any of the money back but said he saw it as an opportunity to call attention to the issue .Detainer supporters often say that cooperation between local police and federal immigration officers has led to the identification of tens of thousands of convicted murderers , child molesters , violent felons and drug traffickers .But several Ohio immigration lawyers and advocates say the inmates who are held often were picked up on minor charges such as traffic violations and misdemeanors that normally would n't warrant their detention .They note that anyone with a serious charge , such as murder , probably would stay in jail until trial .Nationwide , federal immigration agents have issued more than 1 million detainers since 2008 , said Greg Munno , a researcher at Syracuse University 's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse .In 77 percent of those cases , ICE asked local authorities to hold an immigrant who had no criminal record at all and , for example , was stopped for a traffic offense .Richard Herman , a Cleveland immigration lawyer who also has offices in Columbus and Detroit , said U.S. Border Patrol agents who operate in northern Ohio were accused last year of racially motivated stops aimed at Latinos .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.47995"}
