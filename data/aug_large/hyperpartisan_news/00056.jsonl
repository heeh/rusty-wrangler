{"text": "Yesterday Trump was on Laura Ingraham 's radio show and had something to say about the Syrian refugee crisis that most of the civilized world is struggling to address .But his remarks were not about the human suffering or the logistical challenges or potential solutions .What Trump sought to add to the debate was a ludicrous and wholly unfounded conspiracy theory accusing President Obama of another dastardly deed .Trump :They send [ the refugees ] to the Republicans , not to the Democrats , you know , because they know the problems .In California you have a Democrat as a governor .In Florida you have Rick Scott .So , you know , they send them to the Republicans because , you know , why would we want to bother the Democrats ?It 's just insane .Taking these people is absolutely insanity .I do n't know if you know .They 're talking about hundreds of thousands potentially .Hundreds of thousands .Where to begin .How about with the fact that Trump 's assertion is a bald - faced lie .His projection of the distribution of refugees based on the party affiliation of a state 's governor makes no sense whatsoever , and he does n't bother to provide any support for the wild claim .Even using the example that he provided , the facts show that California has already taken in 218 Syrian refugees this year ( more than any other state ) , while Florida has taken only 104 ( placing them down at seventh ) .What 's more , states with Republican governors can be expected to receive more refugees simply because there are more of them .Currently there are 31 states led by Republicans and 18 by Democrats .Furthermore , Trump 's assertion that there are plans to resettle \" hundreds of thousands \" of refugees must have been pulled straight out of his ass , because there is no such estimate in reality .The federal government has committed to receiving about 10,000 refugees .So Trump is only off by at least ninety percent .Now if you 're wondering how Trump can get away with making such blatantly false comments and still retain his position at the top of the GOP primary contest , the answer is in the the type of voter to whom Trump is appealing .A new survey ( pdf ) by the Public Religion Research Institute ( PRRI ) reveals that Trump 's supporters are fervently opposed to immigrants with 69 % saying that \" immigration is a critical issue to them personally .\" That compares to only 50 % of supporters of other Republican candidates .In addition , the survey found that ... .Trump supporters are much more likely to express negative views of immigrants than the supporters of other candidates .Eight in ten ( 80 % )Trump supporters say that immigrants today are a burden to the U.S. because they take American jobs , housing , and health care .Nearly three - quarters ( 73 % ) of Trump supporters say that it bothers them when they come into contact with immigrants who speak little or no English .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.86246"}

{"text": "There 's just one little problem : It is n't the same thing at all .It takes a deliberately obtuse individual to find any similarity between what President Carter did when Americans were being held captive in Iran , and what Trump is proposing now .Iran is a sovereign nation with an identifiable and accessible governing body .In 1979 , in what became known as the Iranian Hostage Crisis , students , with the support of the government , took over the American embassy in Tehran and held fifty - two diplomats hostage .Responding to that act of terrorism , Carter implemented a series of sanctions against the nation of Iran to pressure them to release the hostages .Among the measures taken by Carter was the breaking off of diplomatic relations , suspension of trade , freezing financial assets , and this one that was included in the FrontPage article to vindicate Trump : . \" Invalidate all visas issued to Iranian citizens for future entry into the United States , effective today .We will not reissue visas , nor will we issue new visas , except for compelling and proven humanitarian reasons or where the national interest of our own country requires .\" That is what FrontPage and the Fox Nationalists think is comparable to Trump 's desire to prohibit all Muslims , from all nations , from entering the U.S. based on their religion .Carter was imposing sanctions on the citizens of a country that was unlawfully detaining Americans .That is a reasonable reaction to an act of aggression by sovereign state .It is how diplomacy is conducted in order to pressure an antagonistic country into complying with international law .Trump , on the other hand , is advocating a ban on all individuals of a particular faith .They may have nothing to do with any other nation or entity that is in conflict with the U.S.They may , in fact , be supporters of the U.S. who seek to travel here in order to help in the fight against terrorism .They may be doctors or scientists or teachers who cherish Western freedoms .They may be diplomats or politicians from Canada or Italy or Indonesia .They may be relatives of American Muslims who simply want to visit or reunite with their families .The one identifying characteristic prohibiting them from entry under Trump 's proposal is their religion .That sort of religious bigotry is antithetical to everything for which America stands .It violates the very principles that inspired the first Europeans to venture to a New World .And , unlike the sanctions imposed by Carter , there is no discernible benefit that could be derived from imposing it .Nevertheless , here is the nearly incoherent argument offered by FrontPage : . \" Now unlike Muslims , Iranians were not necessarily supportive of Islamic terrorism .Many were and are opponents of it .Khomeini did n't represent Iran as a country , but his Islamist allies .So Trump 's proposal is far more legitimate than Carter 's action .Carter targeted people by nationality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.65086"}
