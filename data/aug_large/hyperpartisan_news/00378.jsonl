Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) for only releasing tax returns from 2000 on .There has been a lot of back and forth on this during the campaign -- at one point the Obama team was pressuring the Clintons to release the returns for the years after they left the White House .They did , and they revealed the couple hauled in $ 109 million .But Obama has never released the returns from his entire public life -- from his years as a state senator from Illinois .To : Interested Parties From : The Clinton Campaign Date : April 15 , 2008 RE : Tax Day Test : Is Sen. Obama As Transparent As He Claims ?For all of Sen. Obama 's rhetoric about the need for tax return transparency , you 'd think he 'd have released all of his tax records .Guess again .For weeks , Sen. Obama and his campaign relentlessly demanded that Hillary release all of her tax returns even though 20-years of them were already publicly available .His campaign held an endless string of conference calls , issued press releases and flooded the airwaves with surrogates attacking Hillary for not immediately releasing the returns for the last few years she has been in public life .Sen. Obama said the American people \" deserve to know where you get your income from , \" stressing the need for \" full transparency \" and bragging that his campaign has \" set the bar .\"Well , Hillary released tax returns earlier this month and is now the only candidate in this race who has made thirty years worth of tax returns public .But despite his rhetoric , Sen. Obama does n't abide by the standards he sets for others .Sen. Obama has refused to release his tax returns for 1997 , 1998 and 1999 , even though he was in public life as a state senator during those years .During this period of time , Sen. Obama was accepting contributions from special interest lobbyists , PACs and even directly from corporations .In fact , Sen. Obama has a habit of demanding higher standards of transparency for others than for himself .The National Archives has released hundreds of thousands of pages of documents from Hillary 's years as first lady , including her entire schedule .Throughout the campaign , Sen. Obama has demanded Hillary release more documents , even though they are not under her control .Meanwhile , Sen. Obama refuses to release any documents that are more than three years old .At first , Sen. Obama and his campaign told the press that he had records from his state senate years .Later , he said he threw them all out .Whether it 's tax returns or legislative records or his relationship with indicted political fixer Tony Rezko , Senator Obama seems to take \" the dog ate my homework \" approach to disclosure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.41563"}

{"text": "- This is via CTV : .Latest analysis on Hannity 's The Great American Panel suggests that Huma Abedin forgave her husband Anthony Weiner for the sexting scandal because she is planning a secret Islamist conspiracy .Following Anthony Weiner 's confession , Huma Abedin said , \" I love him , I trust him , I believe in him .\" Apparently these words sparked yet another controversy , this time focusing more on Abedin and less on Weiner .Many criticized her for being so forgiving towards a man who actually used to send his nude pictures to other women for a really long time .Fox News contributor Monica Crowley and Hannity guest Brooke Goldstein also blasted Abedin for letting Weiner get away with sexting but their reasoning was just insane .To which Crowley agreed saying , \" Actually what Brooke points to ; that 's the real Huma Abedin story .This [ the scandal ] is about Huma Abedin and her ties to Islamist supremacists . \" Folks , their words are anything but insane ... their words are right on target ! -Watch below : .There are many connections that are far and deep with Huma , Islam and the Muslim Brotherhood .This is one of the very best in - depth reports that ever could be , please take the time to check it out , it 's more than eye - opening !43 Comments .Huma is part and parcel of the Muslim Brotherhood .Washington knows it but nothing is being done .She is Hillary 's right hand woman and what Hillary knows , Huma knows ; and therefore , the Muslim Brotherhood knows .You would think there would be a deeper investigation of Huma but there is n't one .One would believe the FBI or the CIA ( or someone ) would be investigating Huma and her ties with the MB .They are not .Obama is making sure of that .Huma is an excellent little spy .She marries a Jew whom she believes is going somewhere in government so she could get information .She throws him some sex now and then ( but not much ) .She also gets a job with Clinton who became the secretary of State .She has information coming out of her ears and it all goes to her Muslim Brotherhood handlers .Some say that she \" did n't even know Weiner was cheating on her \" so she could not be some master spy .The fact is, .... she did n't care that Weiner is cheating .She could care less because he is a means to an end to her .She did not bother to see what he was doing .Right you are .And remember when Michele Bachmann spoke the truth about who and what Abedin was and is and all the ties she has with the MB , Shrillary and of course all goes to the top dog in the WH etc etc etc .The Arab Spring confrontation really brought all of this out too ... and the msm and other RINOs all look the other way ... still do .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.75365"}

{"text": "As I said in the past , the therapist has some nerve telling you you 're a bad mother .Kayla is away at school living her own college life , but of course she 'll always need her mother , and you 've always been devoted to her and all her activities .Look how much you did last year for her senior year stuff and you were involved with everything she participated in , especially the cheerleading .I know how difficult it is for you to face the fact that Perry is not communicating with you now , but I think for right now , you should not concentrate on that and devote all your efforts / attention to the other important things affecting your life .I think you will go back to your friendship where you communicate here and there and catch up with each others ' lives .Perhaps going there was a mistake and all this would n't have happened if you did n't visit ; BUT ( big ' but ' ) , after all the phone sex , etc . , he wanted you to come there as much as you wanted to go .How were either of you to know something like this would be the result ?You had no way of knowing , but now that you know he has a disorder , it 's the reason he ca n't handle what happened .In a way you ca n't fault him , because he ca n't control it , even though I know his aftions are very hurtful to you .You may have come on a little strong , but that 's the way you 've always acted with him and he needed your leadership , since he was n't doing the leading .He was afraid and unsure of himself .I think you 're right -- he did n't have this kind of stress from the ex because he did n't love her .You can not compare how he felt about her with how he feels about you -- that 's why you make him nervous -- it 's a ' new ' situation and he does n't know how to handle it .I told you , he does nothing because he does n't know what to do .I do n't think you can expect anymore than a friendship with him and eventually , you will get back to that friendship , but it might take a while .Find another therapist ( a woman ) and test out the waters .If you do n't like someone , you can always choose another one , until you feel comfortable .CHER , THANK U SO MUCH !U HAVE MADE ME FEEL SO MUCH BETTER .I WILL GET A NEW THERAPIST .Y DO U THINK SHE IS SO BIASED .I DO THINK LOUIE DOES LOVE ME .BUT , NOT LIKE HE DID .HE LOVES MONEY .HE DOESN'T WANT TO PAY ME ALIMONY .I WILL NOT MAKE THAT DECISION RIGHT NOW .I MAKE MY DECISIONS USING MY HEAD NIT MY HEART .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.4084"}

{"text": "But I have this distinct memory of Huma traipsing in in this blue pantsuit - it was like this wool pantsuit - not a bead of sweat on her brow , not a hair out of place , with everything perfectly organized in her Yves Saint Laurent handbag .\" That sort of fantastical , supernaturally tinged tale is not unusual .Indeed , in the insular world of New York and D.C. politics , Huma Abedin has become a sort of mythical figure .On a day - to - day basis , Ms. Abedin is responsible for guiding the Senator from one chaotic event to the next and ensuring that the many hundreds of situations that arise at each - the photo ops , the handshakes , the speeches - go smoothly .The job of \" body person\"-industry - speak for the catchall role of an omnipresent traveling assistant - is a notoriously grueling one , requiring unfaltering level - headedness and a zeal for multitasking .These folks are constantly on the move , juggling 20 different chores , and they consequently often appear slightly disheveled ( or even sweaty ) .By most quantifiable measures , Ms. Abedin has the most challenging of those gigs .In the last 10 days , she has accompanied Mrs. Clinton to more than 20 events , involving nine plane flights and several trains .At each stop , they were mobbed .\" I think she has special powers , \" said public - radio broadcaster Katia Dunn , who recently crossed paths with Ms. Abedin and Mrs. Clinton at a caf\u00e9 on Capitol Hill .Ms. Dunn explained that she had heard about the \" cult of Huma , \" but had never met her .\" All of a sudden , I turn around and there was this woman I now know to be Huma .And it was n't just that she was gorgeous - she did just sort of have this presence .She stopped me in my tracks for a second . \"\" It 's not like she 's incredibly coiffed , \" Ms. Dunn continued .\" She just looked very composed and confident in her natural beauty .She momentarily arrested our progress .What 's amazing is that she did n't even yell at us or anything - she did n't have to .\" Representative Anthony Weiner , a swingingly single Brooklyn Democrat who has known Ms. Abedin since before Hillary Clinton was elected to office , talked about her ability to perform under pressure \" preternaturally .\" Crossing the bridge was a logistical minefield : huge crowds to navigate , innumerable V.I.P.'s - including former President Clinton - to hand - hold , countless photo ops to facilitate and a strict timetable to keep .\" There were a hundred things that could have gone wrong , \" Mr. Weiner recalled . \"And Huma was sort of the all - purpose trouble - shooter of first response .It was a tour de force , and what was most impressive is that she maintained a level head the whole time . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.33633"}

'What Chase is saying is stay 3 weeks to get into his routine and let him know you 're not going anywhere , and THEN you 're going home !This is why I think it 's not a good idea to stay so long and then leave , considering how he interprets ' leaving'--as abandonment .I do n't think he consciously thinks about it , but just because you 're not talking does n't mean he 's not still scared about the situation .CHER , I AGREE THAT IS Y HE SAYS , I'M NOT FEELING IT .BECAUSE , HE IS SCARED .I UNDERSTAND WHAT U MEAN ABOUT CHASE SATING TO STAY FOR 3 WEEKS .BUT , HE SAID , WHEN I HAVE TO GO BACK TO FLORIDA , HE SAID , TELL PERRY HOW LONG YOUR GOING FOR .THEN , ASK HIM WHEN I COME BACK HOW LONG PERRY WOULD LIKE ME TO STAY FOR .I GET CHASE 'S THINKING HAVE PERRY HAVE AN INPUT .THE ONLY THING THAT I CARE ABOUT IS GOING TO GET MY FRIEND BACK .I KNOW HE CAN'T GIVE ME A GOOD REASON NOT TO BE MY FRIEND .SO , I WILL TELL HIM I KNOW HE IS SCARED BECAUSE , OF WHAT HAPPENED .BUT , U HAVE TO GET PAST THAT AND MOVE ON .LETS BE FRIENDS AGAIN .DO U THINK DO U THINK HE STILL THINKS I ABANDONED HIM ?I WILL PLAY IT BY EAR WHEN I GO THERE .BUT , NO MATTER HOW LONG I STAY HE WILL DO THIS AGAIN WHEN I LEAVE .SO , I KNOW I HAVE TO ASK HIM WHEN I SHOULD COME BACK .OR HOW LONG I SHOULD STAY .I understand why Chase recommended that you involve Perry in the process of deciding when you should come back and for how long ; that might make your leaving easier on him .But , when you left this time , you told him you 'd be back within a comparatively short period of time .I do n't think he still thinks you abandoned him , but I think every time you leave , he will feel a little bit like you 're abandoning him , and you WILL be leaving , so maybe getting his input will help with that , too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.260254"}
