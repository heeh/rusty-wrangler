Board of Education , schools have become increasingly segregated .Some researchers have suggested that American public schools are more segregated now than they were in the 1960s .In addition to being segregated , students of color are much more likely to be punished , and punished more severely than their white peers .During the 2009 - 10 school year , 96,000 students were arrested and 242,000 referred to law enforcement officials .Of those students , more than 70 percent were black or Hispanic .The right to vote .To bring it back to where we started , the Supreme Court 's assertion that the issue of universal suffrage has been solved , even in the most historically racist sections of the country , is simply false .Due to felon disenfranchisement , one in thirteen African - Americans can not vote .In some states , such as Virginia , that number rises to one in five .As of 2004 , more black men were disenfranchised than in 1870 , the year the Fifteenth Amendment , which bars racial discrimination at the voting booth , was ratified .In the wake of the Supreme Court 's decision in Shelby County v. Holder , these disparities will only get worse .Indeed , attempting to purge voter rolls based upon specious accusations of voter fraud is now the predominant method of discouraging or preventing minorities from voting .Reducing the number of polling places and cutting polling place hours is another tried and true method , and we will only see more attempts as the results of the Supreme Court 's decision play out .Arguing for Shelby County before the U.S. Supreme Court , attorney Bert Rein referred to racism as an \" old disease \" and claimed that \" that disease is cured .That problem is solved .\" What has been solved is not the issue of racism , but a public relations issue .Racism is still alive and well in America ; it has simply taken on a more insidious character , and does n't feature the bigoted rants of the Dixiecrats of old .Instead it manifests itself in the public schools , the criminal justice system , the electoral process , and elsewhere , under the veil of seemingly colorblind policies which still tend to target those who have been historically disadvantaged in this country .What has changed since the collapse of Jim Crow has less to do with the basic structure of our society than with the language we use to justify it .In the era of colorblindness , it is no longer socially permissible to use race , explicitly , as a justification for discrimination , exclusion , and social contempt .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.4648"}

{"text": "Syndicalism had an influence on fascism as well particularly as some syndicalists intersected with D'Annunzio 's ideas .Before the First World War , syndicalism had stood for a militant doctrine of working - class revolution .It distinguished itself from Marxism because it insisted that the best route for the working class to liberate itself was the trade union rather than the party .The Italian Socialist Party ejected the syndicalists in 1908 .The syndicalist movement split between anarcho - syndicalists and a more moderate tendency .Some moderates began to advocate \" mixed syndicates \" of workers and employers .In this practice , they absorbed the teachings of Catholic theorists and expanded them to greater power of the state and diverted them by the influence of D'Annunzio to nationalist ends .When Henri De Man 's Italian translation of Au - dela du marxisme emerged , Mussolini was excited and wrote the author that his criticism destroyed any \" scientific \" element left in Marxism .Mussolini was appreciative of the idea that a corporative organization and a new relationship between labor and capital would eliminate ' the clash of economic interests \" and thereby neutralise \" the germ of class warfare . 'Mussolini 's fascist state was established nearly a decade before Hitler 's rise to power .Fascism was , to an extent , a product of a general feeling of anxiety and fear among the middle class of postwar Italy arising because of a convergence of interrelated economic , political , and cultural pressures .Such unfulfilled nationalistic aspirations tainted the reputation of liberalism and constitutionalism among many sectors of the Italian population .In addition , such democratic institutions had never grown to become firmly rooted in the young nation - state .As the same postwar depression heightened the allure of Marxism among an urban proletariat even more disenfranchised than their continental counterparts , fear regarding the growing strength of trade unionism , Communism , and socialism proliferated among the elite and the middle class .In a way , Benito Mussolini filled a political vacuum .Fascism emerged as a \" third way \" - as Italy 's last hope to avoid imminent collapse of the ' weak ' Italian liberalism , and Communist revolution .Under the banners of nationalism and state power , Fascism seemed to synthesize the glorious Roman past with a futuristic utopia .The appeal of this movement , the promise of a more orderly capitalism during an era of interwar depression , however , was not isolated to Italy , or even Europe .For example , a decade later , as the Great Depression led to a sharp economic downturn of the Brazilian economy , a sort of quasi - fascism would emerge there that would react to Brazil 's own socio - economic problems and nationalistic consciousness of its peripheral status in the global economy .The regime of Getulio Vargas adopted extensive fascist influence and entered into an alliance with Integralism , Brazil 's local fascist movement .Initially combining ideological elements of left and right , it aligned itself with the forces of conservatism by its opposition to the September 1920 factory occupations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.18843"}

'Chavez warned , ' Some people do n't look at it as racism , but when you say la raza , you are saying an anti - gringo thing , and our fear is that it wo n't stop there . 'The SPLC has parroted the NCLR line in denying the complexity of the effects of immigration .It has also helped NCLR gloss over the historically and culturally charged meaning of ' La Raza .

{"text": "The latter argues that the contemporary U.S. and Israel are proto - fascist states .[ 4 ] David Neiwert , Rush , Newspeak and Fascism : An Exegesis , online essay .Fascism ( in Italian , fascismo ) , capitalized , refers to the right - wing authoritarian political movement which ruled Italy 1922 - 1943 under the leadership of Benito Mussolini .The name comes from fascio , which may mean , \" bundle , \" as in a political or militant group or a nation , but also from the fasces ( rods bundled around an axe ) , which were an ancient Roman symbol of the authority of magistrates .The Italian ' Fascisti ' were also known as Black Shirts for their style of uniform incorporating a black shirt ( see ; Political Colours ) . ...For the Fascist , everything is within the State and ... neither individuals or groups are outside the State . ...For Fascism , the State is an absolute , before which individuals or groups are only relative . \"In contrast , Mussolini 's fascism held to the ideology that all of these factors existed to serve the state and that it was n't necessarily in the state 's interest to serve or engineer any of these particulars within its sphere as any priority .While Nazism was a metapolitical ideology , seeing itself only as a utility by which an allegorical condition of its people was its goal , fascism was a squarely anti - socialist form of statism that existed by virtue and as an ends in and of itself .The Nazi movement spoke of class based society as the enemy and wanted to unify the racial element above established classes , whereas the Fascist movement sought to preserve the class system and uphold it as the foundation of established and progressive culture .This underlying theorem made the contemporary Fascists and Nazis see themselves and their respective political labels as at least partially exclusive to one another .Today however this difference is not made often in terminology , even when used historically .That is due mostly because both politics have ceased to be a society driven ideology of their own anywhere in the world today .Outside of their internal reasoning their own opposing ideas have no part to play and could even be said to be arbitrarily alien to the liberal states currently dealing in defining political concerns .The resources individuals provide from participating in the community are conceived as a productive duty of individual progress serving an entity greater than the sum of its parts .Therefore all individual 's business is the state 's business , the state 's existence is the sole duty of the individual .Private activity is in a sense contracted to the state so that the state may suspend the infrastructure of any entity in accord to their usefulness and direction , or health to the state .The social composition of Fascist movements have historically been small capitalists , low - level bureaucrats and the middle classes .Fascism also met with great success in rural areas , especially among farmers , peasants , and in the city , the lumpenproletariat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.61164"}

{"text": "I need to anticipate a possible misunderstanding concerning my thesis that socialism is totalitarian by its nature .This concerns the allegedly socialist countries run by Social Democrats , such as Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries , which are clearly not totalitarian dictatorships .In such cases , it is necessary to realize that along with these countries not being totalitarian , they are also not socialist .Their governing parties may espouse socialism as their philosophy and their ultimate goal , but socialism is not what they have implemented as their economic system .Their actual economic system is that of a hampered market economy , as Mises termed it .While more hampered than our own in important respects , their economic system is essentially similar to our own , in that the characteristic driving force of production and economic activity is not government decree but the initiative of private owners motivated by the prospect of private profit .The reason that Social Democrats do not establish socialism when they come to power , is that they are unwilling to do what would be required .The establishment of socialism as an economic system requires a massive act of theft - the means of production must be seized from their owners and turned over to the state .Such seizure is virtually certain to provoke substantial resistance on the part of the owners , resistance which can be overcome only by use of massive force .The Communists were and are willing to apply such force , as evidenced in Soviet Russia .Their character is that of armed robbers prepared to commit murder if that is what is necessary to carry out their robbery .As for the Nazis , they generally did not have to kill in order to seize the property of Germans other than Jews .This was because , as we have seen , they established socialism by stealth , through price controls , which served to maintain the outward guise and appearance of private ownership .The private owners were thus deprived of their property without knowing it and thus felt no need to defend it by force .I think I have shown that socialism - actual socialism - is totalitarian by its very nature .In the United States at the present time , we do not have socialism in any form .And we do not have a dictatorship , let alone a totalitarian dictatorship .We also do not yet have Fascism , though we are moving towards it .Among the essential elements that are still lacking are one - party rule and censorship .We still have freedom of speech and press and free elections , though both have been undermined and their continued existence can not be guaranteed .What we have is a hampered market economy that is growing ever more hampered by ever more government intervention , and that is characterized by a growing loss of individual freedom .Today , in the United States , government spending , federal , state , and local , amounts to almost half of the monetary incomes of the portion of the citizenry that does not work for the government .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.9158"}

{"text": "Dictatorship of the proletariat is supposed to mean workers democracy or dictatorship by the working class rather than dictatorship by the capitalist class .This concept had been distorted under Stalin to mean dictatorship by the General Secretary over the party and the working class but that means that Stalin deviated from Marx rather than that the Stalinist form of government is Marxist .Instead , the fascist economic model of corporatism promoted class collaboration by attempting to bring classes together under the unity of the state .However , the fact that fascist states , on the one hand , and the USSR and the Soviet bloc , on the other , were police states does not mean that their commonality is a product of socialism .Conversely , there have been multi - party socialist states that have not been police states .At the end of World War I there were attempted socialist uprisings or threats of socialist uprisings throughout Europe , most notably in Germany where the Spartacist uprising in Germany led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in January 1919 failed .In Bavaria , Communists successfully overthrew the government and established the Munich Soviet that lasted from 1918 - 1919 .A short lived soviet government was also established in Hungary under B\u00e9la Kun in 1919 .The Russian Revolution also inspired attempted revolutionary movements in Italy with a wave of factory occupations .Most historians view fascism as a response to these developments , as a movement that both tried to appeal to the working class and divert them from Marxism and also appealed to capitalists as a bulwark against Bolshevism .Italian fascism - founded and led by Benito Mussolini - took power with the blessing of Italy 's king after years of leftist - led unrest led many conservatives to fear that a communist revolution was inevitable .Throughout Europe numerous aristocrats and conservative intellectuals as well as capitalists and industrialists lent their support to fascist movements in their countries which arose in emulation of Italian fascism .In Germany numerous right wing nationalist groups arose , particularly out of the post - war Freikorps , which were used to crush both the Spartacist uprising and the Munich Soviet .With the worldwide Great Depression of the 1930s it seemed that liberalism and the liberal form of capitalism were doomed , and Communist and fascist movements swelled .These movements were bitterly opposed to each other and fought frequently , the most notable example of this conflict being the Spanish Civil War .The Civil War became a proxy war between the fascist countries and their international supporters - who backed Franco - and the worldwide Communist movement allied uneasily with anarchists and Trotskyists - who backed the Popular Front - and were aided chiefly by the Soviet Union .Initially , the Soviet Union supported the idea of a coalition with the western powers against Nazi Germany as well as popular fronts in various countries against domestic fascism .This policy was largely unsuccessful due to the distrust shown by the western powers ( especially Britain ) towards the Soviet Union .The Munich Agreement between Germany , France and Britain heightened Soviet fears that the western powers were endeavoring to force them to bear the brunt of a war against Nazism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.178345"}

Dees Jr. and Joseph Levin Jr. ( who is now general counsel ) , the SPLC started out fighting legal battles against lingering segregation in the South .The Hate Map does n't include the groups ' street addresses , but those typically take only a few seconds to find with Google .Besides the chicken sandwiches and some 50 rounds of ammunition found on Corkins 's person was the address of the Traditional Values Coalition , another D.C.-based \" anti - gay \" group listed on the SPLC 's Hate Map .At the time of the shooting , FRC president Tony Perkins lost no time doing a sort of reverse Sarah Palin on the SPLC .( The Tucson gunman , Jared Lee Loughner , who killed six people in the crowd at Giffords 's event , turned out to be a schizophrenic whose politics , insofar as they could be determined , leaned left . ) \" The Southern Poverty Law Center is dangerous , \" Perkins declared on his nightly radio show on February 6 .\" They are inciting hatred , and in this case a clear connection to violence .They need to be held accountable , and they need to be stopped before people are killed because of their reckless labeling and advocacy for homosexuality and their anti - Christian stance .\" Of course , it was as ridiculous to blame the SPLC for Corkins 's rampage as it had been to blame Palin for Loughner 's .Irony turns out to be what the SPLC is all about .From its very beginning the SPLC , thanks to Dees 's talent for crafting multi - page alarmist fundraising letters , has not only continuously operated in the black , but has steadily accumulated a mountain of surpluses augmented by a shrewdly managed investment portfolio .Today the SPLC 's net assets total more than $ 256 million ( that figure appears on the SPLC 's 2011 tax return , the latest posted on the organization 's website ) .That represented a more - than - doubling of the $ 120 million in net assets that the SPLC reported in 2000 , which was itself more than a doubling of the $ 52 million in net assets that the SPLC reported during the mid-1990s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.36236"}

Bush .Indeed , it was a centerpiece of the failed 1993 Republican healthcare proposal .A Liberal form of healthcare ?That would be socialized medicine .The kind of thing that much of Europe has .That Canada has .That Vermont is poised to implement on a statewide level . ObamaCare ?It really is RomneyCare , just as RomneyCare really is ObamaCare .The smear cuts both ways .It 's a two - way mirror that each man attempts to hide behind , but which clearly reveals both of them in all of their center - right glory .Thus , the Florida decision was not a victory for Liberalism .Regardless of your actual opinion about the healthcare bill , in reality this decision is a reflection of center - right dominance in America .Second is just how far to the right this nation has swung over the last quarter - century .So far to the right that , as we witnessed last week , a major policy initiative that used to be Republican is now Democrat .And most people simply accept that reality .But how did this happen ?How did America 's rightward drift over the last 20 + years reach the point that Liberals would cheer when the Supreme Court , by the narrowest of margins , votes to let stand a Right Wing version of healthcare reform ?Of course there are many reasons , including the decline of Liberalism in the 1970s , the Reagan revolution of the 1980s , and changes in the workforce and economy just to name a few .And they 're all important .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.71245"}

{"text": "The answer is a combination of severe penalties combined with a great likelihood of being caught and then actually suffering those penalties .Mere fines are not likely to provide much of a deterrent .They will be regarded simply as an additional business expense .If the government is serious about its price controls , it is necessary for it to impose penalties comparable to those for a major felony .But the mere existence of such penalties is not enough .The government has to make it actually dangerous to conduct black - market transactions .It has to make people fear that in conducting such a transaction they might somehow be discovered by the police , and actually end up in jail .In order to create such fear , the government must develop an army of spies and secret informers .For example , the government must make a storekeeper and his customer fearful that if they engage in a black - market transaction , some other customer in the store will report them .Because of the privacy and secrecy in which many black - market transactions can be conducted , the government must also make anyone contemplating a black - market transaction fearful that the other party might turn out to be a police agent trying to entrap him .The government must make people fearful even of their long - time associates , even of their friends and relatives , lest even they turn out to be informers .And , finally , in order to obtain convictions , the government must place the decision about innocence or guilt in the case of black - market transactions in the hands of an administrative tribunal or its police agents on the spot .If the government is unwilling to go to such lengths , then , to that extent , its price controls prove unenforceable and simply break down .The black market then assumes major proportions .( Incidentally , none of this is to suggest that price controls were the cause of the reign of terror instituted by the Nazis .The Nazis began their reign of terror well before the enactment of price controls .As a result , they enacted price controls in an environment ready made for their enforcement . )Black market activity entails the commission of further crimes .Under de facto socialism , the production and sale of goods in the black market entails the defiance of the government 's regulations concerning production and distribution , as well as the defiance of its price controls .For example , the goods themselves that are sold in the black market are intended by the government to be distributed in accordance with its plan , and not in the black market .The factors of production used to produce those goods are likewise intended by the government to be used in accordance with its plan , and not for the purpose of supplying the black market .Under a system of de jure socialism , such as existed in Soviet Russia , in which the legal code of the country openly and explicitly makes the government the owner of the means of production , all black - market activity necessarily entails the misappropriation or theft of state property .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.49334"}

Roosevelt 's New Deal in the United States , and Juan Peron 's populism in Argentina .Prominent proponents of fascism in pre - WWII America included the publisher Seward Collins , whose periodical The American Review ( 1933 - 1937 ) featured essays by Collins and others that praised Mussolini and Hitler .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.86696"}

{"text": "And ( 2 ) to show why socialism , understood as an economic system based on government ownership of the means of production , positively requires a totalitarian dictatorship .The identification of Nazi Germany as a socialist state was one of the many great contributions of Ludwig von Mises .When one remembers that the word \" Nazi \" was an abbreviation for \" der Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiters Partei - in English translation : the National Socialist German Workers ' Party - Mises 's identification might not appear all that noteworthy .For what should one expect the economic system of a country ruled by a party with \" socialist \" in its name to be but socialism ?Nevertheless , apart from Mises and his readers , practically no one thinks of Nazi Germany as a socialist state .It is far more common to believe that it represented a form of capitalism , which is what the Communists and all other Marxists have claimed .The basis of the claim that Nazi Germany was capitalist was the fact that most industries in Nazi Germany appeared to be left in private hands .What Mises identified was that private ownership of the means of production existed in name only under the Nazis and that the actual substance of ownership of the means of production resided in the German government .The position of the alleged private owners , Mises showed , was reduced essentially to that of government pensioners .If the individual is a means to the ends of the State , so too , of course , is his property .Just as he is owned by the State , his property is also owned by the State .But what specifically established de facto socialism in Nazi Germany was the introduction of price and wage controls in 1936 .These were imposed in response to the inflation of the money supply carried out by the regime from the time of its coming to power in early 1933 .The Nazi regime inflated the money supply as the means of financing the vast increase in government spending required by its programs of public works , subsidies , and rearmament .The price and wage controls were imposed in response to the rise in prices that began to result from the inflation .The effect of the combination of inflation and price and wage controls is shortages , that is , a situation in which the quantities of goods people attempt to buy exceed the quantities available for sale .Shortages , in turn , result in economic chaos .It 's not only that consumers who show up in stores early in the day are in a position to buy up all the stocks of goods and leave customers who arrive later , with nothing - a situation to which governments typically respond by imposing rationing .Shortages result in chaos throughout the economic system .They introduce randomness in the distribution of supplies between geographical areas , in the allocation of a factor of production among its different products , in the allocation of labor and capital among the different branches of the economic system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.972"}

Carl Levin also reaffirmed for Mr. Bush 's benefit what he had told Mr. Clinton some years earlier : Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region .He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations , and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them .Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton agreed , speaking in October 2002 : .In the four years since the inspectors left , intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical- and biological - weapons stock , his missile - delivery capability , and his nuclear program .He has also given aid , comfort , and sanctuary to terrorists , including al - Qaeda members .Senator Jay Rockefeller , vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , agreed as well : .There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . . . .We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction .Even more striking were the sentiments of Bush 's opponents in his two campaigns for the presidency .Thus Al Gore in September 2002 : .We know that [ Saddam ] has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.38167"}

{"text": "Appealing to Iowa and New Hampshire voters requires different messages than would resonate nationwide .But if candidates fail to move the homogenous voters of these states , they 're at risk of seeing their funding dry up and their ambitions busted .Presidential hopefuls should have to prove their appeal to a broader audience early on .The primary season should be revamped to force them to spend those early months demonstrating the resources to mount a national campaign .The lack of diversity in the two earliest states has handed a big advantage to Bernie Sanders .We 'll have to wait for Nevada and South Carolina to see how much impact his \" enthusiastic \" support in Iowa and New Hampshire has had on voters in states that are more representative of the U.S. population .And let 's not let voters forget that Sanders clearly stated in a debate that he considers white people to be the \" general population \" and African Americans and Latinos to be somehow outside the \" general population .\" Sanders was asked about this exact problem at the debate Sunday night in Charleston .His answer : .We have the momentum , we 're on a path to a victory . \"A little bit condescending , no ?So we can only wait and see what happens on Tuesday and go from there .I do n't think it 's time for the Clinton campaign to panic just yet .For a little deep background on the New Hampshire primary , here 's a great article from 1988 by the Washington Post 's Henry Allen : New Hampshire is a fraud .New Hampshire is a fraud .They sell the rest of the country maple syrup , lottery tickets and Yankee sagacity the way Indians on reservations sell moccasins , bingo and environmental wisdom .They never shut up about how closemouthed they are .They beat you rich and they beat you poor .They exhibit the ethics of Switzerland and the shrugging shabbiness of New Jersey .Or as Emerson wrote : \" The God who made New Hampshire taunted the lofty land with little men .\" The question is not who they think they are , to be holding us hostage every four years with their presidential primary .As Thomas Jefferson said , after New Hampshire town meetings had attacked his Embargo Act , \" The organization of this little selfish minority enabled it to overrule the union .\" Now that Bernie Sanders is looking less like a quixotic left - wing protest candidate and more like a serious contender for the Democratic presidential nomination , a contradiction at the heart of his campaign is becoming more glaring .You can call it the Radical 's Dilemma , or the Revolutionary 's Quandary , or maybe just Bernie 's Obama Problem .Whatever you call it , it was on stark display at last night 's debate in New Hampshire , even though Sanders tried to gloss over it .The conundrum boils down to a schizophrenic view of a nation where progressive change is impossible and where progressive change is simultaneously happening .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.33363"}

{"text": "What is it that is omitted here ?We all heard the President make the statement many times .Here is the key element : because George Bush subsequently acted ( attacked Iraq ) based upon this statement , the democrats are trying to make it seem like the statement really is : .Bush said it , but so did Clinton , Gore , Daschle , Kennedy , Pelosi and Kerry , to say nothing of Koffi Annan and Dominique de Villepin .Even Saddam Hussein said that he had weapons of mass destruction .Weekly Standard Link .No , the liars on the left find it convenient to assign a belief which is held by all , and attribute it to one ( and only one ) person .This disingenuous act is exacerbated by their turning the truth further on its head by calling Bush the liar .The democrats have attempted ( rather successfully ) to frame their argument that Bush made an assertion which ultimately he has been unable to prove .They ( conveniently ) omit just enough to keep their argument strong .What is inarguable is that Saddam , at one point in time , did have Weapons of Mass Destruction .It is inarguable because there is clear evidence that he used them .He killed thousands of Kurds with poison gas , dealt the Marsh Arabs a similar fate , and was actively using chemical weapons throughout the long war with Iran .The 1998 inventoried list , as cited above in The Weekly Standard , is not in dispute .The United Nations passed over a dozen resolutions , attempting to get Saddam to disarm .The final one , Resolution 1441 , clearly , irrevocably , and for the final time , gave Saddam a last chance to come clean .Since the weapons clearly existed at one time , it was necessary for Saddam , as demanded by The United Nations , to hand over all proscribed munitions , and to explain and verify what had become of the rest .If weapons had been destroyed , he was to show evidence ( video , trace element , even a bookkeeping entry ) to prove it .No evidence of such compliance has ever been offered .The onus was on Saddam to prove he had destroyed known stocks of illegal weapons .The onus is not , as implied by the democrats , on George Bush to find those weapons .It is almost as if George Bush had invaded some peace - loving nation , like Switzerland , accusing it of making illegal weapons .That is not the case at all .To give another analogy , consider the case of a mass - murderer who pulls out an automatic weapon and fires into a bunch of schoolchildren , killing nine of them .There are about a thousand witnesses , including a police officer , who gives chase .Put down your weapon !Put your hands up and surrender !The policeman uses his own weapon to shoot the guy .If you are a democrat , the only conclusion that you could draw is that the weapon never existed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.908714"}
