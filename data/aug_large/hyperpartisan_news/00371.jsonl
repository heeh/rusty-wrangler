{"text": "Is it true that there are bills in the House and Senate that will exempt members and their staff and families from buying into Obamacare ? FULL ANSWER .Several readers have asked us about Congress attempting to exempt itself from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act .A few said that a Facebook post claimed that President Barack Obama , Sen. Harry Reid and Democrats in Congress were trying to \" get themselves exempted from Obamacare , \" in the words of one reader .But there is no bill in Congress calling for an exemption from the health care law .In fact , members of Congress and their staffs face additional requirements that most Americans do n't have to meet .Under the health care law , their insurance coverage will have to switch from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program , the group of private insurance plans that cover 8 million federal employees and retirees , to the exchanges created by the law .Those exchanges are meant for those who buy coverage on their own , the currently uninsured and small businesses .Members of Congress and their staffs would be the only employees of a large employer in the exchanges , which are set to begin offering insurance in January .So , why is the false \" exempt \" claim making the Facebook rounds ?There is reportedly concern on Capitol Hill that the Office of Personnel Management , which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program , wo n't be able to smoothly transition members and their staffs into an exchange .The concern , as a Roll Call story explained , was that the government would n't be able to make contributions toward the federal employees ' premiums , at least at the beginning of 2014 .That would mean employees would pick up the whole tab for their insurance policies .Right now , the government pays 72 percent of premiums on average .The \" exempt \" claims were sparked by a Politico report on April 24 that said secret talks were being held by lawmakers to change the requirement to get insurance through the exchanges because of this concern .The headline on the story said \" Lawmakers , aides may get Obamacare exemption . \"After the story was published , a spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid said there had n't been any discussions to exempt Congress from \" provisions that apply to any employees of any other public or private employer offering health care . \"And Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California told Politico that lawmakers and their staffs will indeed get insurance through the exchanges .\" [ T]he federal government will offer them health insurance coverage that they obtained through the exchanges because we want to get the same health care coverage everybody else has available to them , \" he said .We contacted the Office of Personnel Management and received this statement from an administration official : \" Members of Congress will not receive anything that is not available to the public .The law does n't allow them to get insurance from FEHB , they are going to get insurance on the market place , just like uninsured individuals and small businesses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "31.91697"}
