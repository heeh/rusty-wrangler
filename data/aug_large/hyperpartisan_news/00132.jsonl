{"text": "But from the social network 's point of view , the main benefit is that it keeps people inside Facebook , because there 's effectively no option to click and go somewhere else .The spider and the fly .In fact , according to the Wall Street Journal , in some cases you ca n't include a link to the website that published the story even if you want to .Since the Washington Post publishes 100 % of its content through the Facebook Instant Articles feature - a somewhat controversial strategy - if you try to link to a story on the Post website , it winds up getting converted into a link to the Instant Article .According to both the New York Times and Facebook itself , the initial results show that Instant Articles get shared a lot more than the more traditional kind of post that has an excerpt from a story and a link .Because the posts load quickly , it 's more likely people will read and share them , Facebook product manager Michael Reckhow pointed out in a recent interview with the Nieman Journalism Lab .That 's good for Facebook FB , since it means more engagement , which is the whole reason why they are reaching out to publishers in the first place .And theoretically it 's a good idea for the media outlets that are participating , because their content is being shared more widely and they are reaching more people .The almighty algorithm .But do publishers lose out because their articles and videos live completely inside Facebook ?The social network argues they do n't , because they get to sell the same advertising as they would on their own site , or they can share the revenue from Facebook 's ads ( Twitter does n't share revenue from Moments , at least not yet ) .And the traffic that occurs with Instant Articles is treated the same by audience measurement firms like Omniture , as though it was on their own site .So where is the downside ?The risk is that since news consumption occurs entirely inside Facebook , the social network becomes the default source of news for large numbers of people , and they eventually stop associating that news with the outlet that actually created it .There 's already some evidence that this is happening .On top of that , because Facebook controls the algorithm that determines what users see or do n't see , then it gets to decide what the news is , and what is important .And that 's a potential problem if Facebook chooses to delete disturbing images or news stories about war and promote peaceful happy stories instead .In some cases , information disappears from Facebook and the social network never explains why .Should we mourn the hyperlink ?More broadly though , is the death of the hyperlink something we should be concerned about ?Does it matter that growing numbers of users , particularly on mobile devices , never actually go to the source of the news they are reading ?Many people never clicked on links even before mobile and the social web came along , either because they were lazy or because they did n't have time to go any deeper .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.701218"}

{"text": "Strategic decision : The bullish case for partnering with Facebook can probably best be summed up by BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti , whose company is the epitome of the distributed model for news and content .In other words , it creates and publishes video and photos and text and news stories on a variety of platforms , including Facebook , Instagram , Snapchat and more - and none of that content is designed to push readers to the company 's website .It lives or dies on its own .The argument for this strategy is simple : That 's how content works now .Young users in particular do n't go to websites any more - they find the news and other content on social networks , or are referred by their friends .So in order to reach them , publishers have to go where they are .Other publishers are also taking this approach , including Vox Media , Mashable and Business Insider .\" We want to reach current and future readers on all platforms , and we are n't holding anything back , \" Washington Post publisher Fred Ryan said in a statement .\" The Post has seen explosive growth in readership over the past year [ and ] working with partners like Facebook allows us to further attract and engage those readers . \"And if there 's anyone who knows the value of a platform , it is Washington Post owner and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos .Faustian bargain : The counter - argument to the Washington Post 's approach has a number of facets to it .For one thing , many open - Web advocates argue that these kinds of deals cement control of the internet with a few large platforms such as Facebook , which may not always have the best interests of news and journalism at heart .The giant social network has a habit of removing things for its own reasons - in some cases content that has an important social and journalistic purpose .Handing over all your content to Facebook , the theory goes , may get you a larger readership and brand awareness , and it may even get you a bunch of advertising revenue .But it also increases the power of the social network , and it uses your own content to do so .Many younger users already do n't know where the content they read originally comes from - all they know is that they get it from Facebook .Instant Articles will increase that effect .Then there 's the risk that Facebook will change its mind about what it sees as important , or whose content it wants to highlight using its all - powerful algorithm .We do n't even have to speculate about what this might look like , since the Washington Post was part of an earlier experiment called \" Social Readers .\" Under that deal , newspapers created social - reading apps that lived on Facebook and allowed users to consume the paper 's content without having to leave the network .This worked great for awhile - publishers like the Post signed up millions of readers and their apps were promoted heavily by Facebook .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.103756"}
{"text": "Facebook 's \" Instant Articles \" and Twitter 's new Moments feature seem to be accelerating this phenomenon , for better or worse .The whole point of Facebook 's Instant Articles project , in which it has formed partnerships with publishers like the New York Times , is that the content from those publishers exists completely inside Facebook 's mobile app .It 's consumed there , and shared there - there 's no link to an external site because it 's unnecessary .Twitter TWTR seems to be taking a similar approach with Moments , a listing of tweets and images that are selected by the company 's editorial staff .They are a great way to catch up on the news , but if you want to get at the link to the underlying story , it is hidden three clicks deep .Realistically , there 's zero chance that anyone will actually click those links .The stated reason for Facebook 's Instant Articles is to help publishers speed up the loading of their articles on mobile .But from the social network 's point of view , the main benefit is that it keeps people inside Facebook , because there 's effectively no option to click and go somewhere else .The spider and the fly .In fact , according to the Wall Street Journal , in some cases you ca n't include a link to the website that published the story even if you want to .Since the Washington Post publishes 100 % of its content through the Facebook Instant Articles feature - a somewhat controversial strategy - if you try to link to a story on the Post website , it winds up getting converted into a link to the Instant Article .According to both the New York Times and Facebook itself , the initial results show that Instant Articles get shared a lot more than the more traditional kind of post that has an excerpt from a story and a link .Because the posts load quickly , it 's more likely people will read and share them , Facebook product manager Michael Reckhow pointed out in a recent interview with the Nieman Journalism Lab .That 's good for Facebook FB , since it means more engagement , which is the whole reason why they are reaching out to publishers in the first place .And theoretically it 's a good idea for the media outlets that are participating , because their content is being shared more widely and they are reaching more people .The almighty algorithm .But do publishers lose out because their articles and videos live completely inside Facebook ?The social network argues they do n't , because they get to sell the same advertising as they would on their own site , or they can share the revenue from Facebook 's ads ( Twitter does n't share revenue from Moments , at least not yet ) .And the traffic that occurs with Instant Articles is treated the same by audience measurement firms like Omniture , as though it was on their own site .So where is the downside ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.642174"}

{"text": "One of these major issues that they 're dealing with right now ( thus this blog post ) is the subject of advertorials .Certainly I do n't have access to how they actually identify advertorials , but let 's examine the likelihood of how they do it .What we know is that Google has to work in identifying advertorials into their algorithm - or one of the \" checks \" or \" processes \" that they run from time to time to deal with what I would call \" advertorial spam \" .It just simply is not \" scaleable \" to identify advertorials solely based on spam reports that they receive from users or manually review websites .So , what Google does is identify the typical \" footprint \" of advertorials across the board , and then narrow them down to a specific list of URLs that are most likely advertorials .At that point , how they deal with them is anyone 's guess .Whether or not Google has someone actually manually review those URLs and then decide to give the site that 's benefiting from the advertorial a manual link warning is also anyone 's guess .But my suspicion is that Google 's filter first identifies the sites and then someone works off a list of some sort .So how could Google identify the footprint of advertorials ?Luckily , I have personally dealt with manual link warnings by Google ( this is something I specialize in ) , and have seen the actual URLs that Google has given us as examples : which were advertorials .So I know exactly what Google is identifying as an advertorial because they have given me specific URLs as examples .Keep in mind that Google has absolutely NO WAY to determine whether or not the website owner was paid or compensated in any way for the advertorial .But , nonetheless , Google hands out manual link warnings and manual penalties for these advertorials .Based on my experience , these are tell - tale signs of advertorials : the kind of web pages that will get your website penalized in the Google search results , even if no money or compensation changed hands for the link on the page .Typically several of these signs indicate that it 's an advertorial : . - The web page contains an article , typically several paragraphs of text .- The page has one outgoing link , towards the bottom of the page .If an article contains several paragraphs , it is not \" natural \" to only have one outgoing link at the bottom of the page .What IS natural is to link out a few times to trusted sites in the middle of the article , where the link is in the middle of a sentence .- That one outgoing link is close to , or at the end of a promotional - type sentence .This is where it gets interesting .I believe that Google has the ability to identify copy that 's promotional in nature .Certainly phrases like \" sponsored by \" or \" provided by \" would be good candidates here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.69878"}
