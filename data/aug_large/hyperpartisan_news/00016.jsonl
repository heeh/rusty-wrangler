Bernie Sanders won an impressive victory , one that will rattle plenty of party leaders who wanted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to cruise to the nomination unruffled and well financed .So voters in states across America now have every reason to think they , too , will get a voice in deciding these nominations .Five , perhaps six Republican candidates will battle on .The names Kasich , Cruz , Rubio , Bush and Trump - and perhaps Christie as well - are linked for at least several more weeks .Among Democrats , Mr. Sanders has humbled the once inevitable candidate and emerged with two attributes so many other upstart challengers have n't had : a natural base of support and a big bank account .So these races are n't ending soon .Of course , history ca n't be entirely ignored , especially when it comes to Iowa and New Hampshire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.98166"}

' 'The rest of the increase was a result of a sharp jump in imported goods other than oil .Despite an increase in bilateral trade agreements , the United States has failed to increase its exports at anywhere near the increase in its imports .The trade deficit will continue to climb if the trend continues and imports continue to outstrip exports .The nation is running a trade deficit with its major trading partners , including Canada , China , the European Union and Japan .Once again , the deficit with China -- at $ 16.8 billion in October -- set a record .Some trade experts predict that the ballooning deficit could lead to more demands for ways to limit Chinese exports or to a re - examination of the trade relationship .The U.S. trade deficit with China is on pace to exceed an astounding record of $ 160 billion this year , almost double the level from just three years ago , ' ' Mr. Levin said .Some trade experts question whether new trade agreements are the solution to the growing deficit .Greg Elias , a trade lawyer and former senior Congressional aide , said that the trade deficits were a result of trade agreements that are really investment agreements .Our trade agreements are about investing in foreign countries and sending back the products unimpeded to the United States , ' ' Mr. Elias said .Chart : ' ' Balance of Trade ' 'The deficit is the excess of imports over exports for goods and services .Amounts are rounded , in billions of dollars , seasonally adjusted .Oct. 2004 Balance -- -$55.46 Imports -- 153.53 Exports -- 98.10 .Graph tracks Imports and Exports since May 2003 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.479996"}

{"text": "GDP Estimates Move Lower Following Durables Report .At first glance , today 's Commerce Department report on durable goods looks solid : Orders for long - lasting , factory - made items rose 9.9 % in September from a month earlier , a big rebound from the 13.1 % drop in August .But the rise was largely due to a rebound in commercial aircraft orders , which tend to swing from month to month .Details within the report were discouraging - and could point to a weaker - than - expected figure in Friday 's much - anticipated report on third - quarter gross domestic product .Perhaps most concerning : Business investment has fallen over the last three months .Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft - a proxy for business spending on equipment and software - were flat in September , after rising a bleak 0.2 % in August and falling 5.6 % in July .Shipments of those goods have fallen in each of the past three months .Until now , business investment , while hardly robust , has helped the economy grow .Last year , such spending accounted for nearly half - 0.8 percentage point - of the 1.8 % growth in the nation 's GDP , according to Stephen Stanley , economist at consultancy Pierpont Securities LLC .But Thursday 's figures have Mr. Stanley and other economists predicting that business spending was so weak over the summer that it may actually have held back the economy - acting as a \" drag \" in economist speak - rather than helped it .The consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires is that Friday 's report will show the economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.8 % in the July - to - September quarter .But after Thursday 's figures on business investment , some economists said they are bracing for a weaker GDP report than the consensus figure .Wells Fargo - pointing out that shipments of core capital goods fell at an annual pace of 4.9 % over three months - lowered its estimate of third - quarter GDP growth to an annual rate of 1.4 % from 1.6 % .J.P. Morgan Chase lowered its forecast to 1.6 % from 1.8 % .The downside risks are mounting to our already below - consensus estimate that GDP increased by only 1.3 % in the third quarter , \" Paul Ashworth , chief U.S. economist at London - based Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .\" At 1.8 % , the consensus forecast looks way to high .Mr. Ashworth , in addition to citing the weak business - spending numbers , pointed to a modest rise in durable - goods inventories as another possible sign that third - quarter GDP growth could be weaker than most economists expect .The precise reasons behind the weakness in business spending has been a source of debate among economists in recent weeks , but the backdrop is clear .Many companies say they are increasingly skittish about making long - term investments as the global economy weakens , with much of Europe mired in recession and China 's economy cooling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.825874"}

{"text": "At the Convention , several prominent Framers argued unsuccessfully to have the House of Representatives included .But most delegates thought that the House had substantial disadvantages when it came to treaty - making .For example , as a large body , the House would have difficulty keeping secrets or acting quickly .The small states , wary of being disadvantaged , also preferred to keep the treaty - making power in the Senate , where they had proportionally greater power .The ultimate purpose , then , of the Treaty Clause was to ensure that treaties would not be adopted unless most of the country stood to gain .True , treaties would be more difficult to adopt than statutes , but the Framers realized that an unwise statute could simply be repealed , but an unwise treaty remained a binding international commitment , which would not be so easy to unwind .Other questions , however , remained .First , are the provisions of the clause exclusive - that is , does it provide the only way that the United States may enter into international obligations ?Article I , Section 10 , in describing restrictions upon the states , speaks of \" Treat[ies ] \" and \" Agreement[s] ... with a foreign Power \" as two distinct categories .Some scholars believe this shows that not all international agreements are treaties , and that these other agreements would not need to go through the procedures of the Treaty Clause .Instead , the President , in the exercise of his executive power , could conclude such agreements on his own .Still , this exception for lesser agreements would have to be limited to \" agreements \" of minor importance , or else it would provide too great an avenue for evasion of the protections the Framers placed in the Treaty Clause .A second question is how the President and Senate should interact in their joint exercise of the treaty power .Many Framers apparently thought that the President would oversee the actual conduct of diplomacy , but that the Senate would be involved from the outset as a sort of executive council advising the President .This was likely a reason that the Framers thought the smaller Senate was more suited than the House to play a key role in treaty - making .In the first effort at treaty - making under the Constitution , President George Washington attempted to operate in just this fashion .He went to the Senate in person to discuss a proposed treaty before he began negotiations .What is less clear , however , is whether the Constitution actually requires this process , or whether it is only what the Framers assumed would happen .The Senate , of course , is constitutionally authorized to offer \" advice \" to the President at any stage of the treaty - making process , but the President is not directed ( in so many words ) as to when advice must be solicited .As we shall see , this uncertainty has led , in modern practice , to a very different procedure than some Framers envisioned .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.30658"}

Scott Walker of Wisconsin .Maybe it was inevitable .Of all the practicing politicians in the scramble , Walker is possibly the sloppiest public speaker .Compared with him , Chris Christie can be a pinnacle of verbal discipline .Last week , Walker was on a radio talk show , praising a law he signed requiring women who want an abortion to undergo an ultrasound .Which they 're supposed to watch , while the physician points out the features of the fetus .An ultrasound , he said , was \" just a cool thing .\" That Gail Collins describes the baby in the ultrasound as a fetus shows that she is n't coming at this from an unbiased perspective .How many women , when they see their first ultrasound , say \" Look at my fetus \" ?Are n't they most likely to say \" Look at my baby \" ?The whole reason why Wisconsin legislators passed that bill and Gov. Walker signed it into law is because a significant number of women that see their baby when they get an ultrasound decide not to get an abortion .There are 2 points that are essential to this article .First , it is n't coincidental that Gail Collins ' fury is directed at Scott Walker .When she wrote about Gov. Walker in February , she could n't be bothered with getting the facts straight .This was n't a difficult project .Anyone with a memory knew that Gov. Walker was n't elected until November , 2010 .Anyone with an ounce of professional pride would 've gotten that right .She did n't .Second , it 's clear that Ms. Collins is n't in touch with people in the heartland .Apparently , in Ms. Collins ' world , the widely held belief is that anyone who does anything that makes it more difficult to have an abortion is a Neanderthal .Anyone that can compare the stupid thing that Todd Akin said with what Scott Walker said is frightening .Games may have been played yesterday in connection with the week 's resounding media story .On Thursday morning , Politico media reporter Dylan Byers broke the story of George Stephanopoulos 's big - money donations to the Clinton Foundation ( at first they were reported as $ 50,000 but grew to $ 75,000 by day 's end ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.352585"}

{"text": "A third difficult question is whether the Treaty Clause implies a Senate power or role in treaty termination .Scholarly opinion is divided , and few Framers appear to have discussed the question directly .One view sees the power to make a treaty as distinct from the power of termination , with the latter being more akin to a power of implementation .Since the Constitution does not directly address the termination power , this view would give it to the President as part of the President 's executive powers to conduct foreign affairs and to execute the laws .When the termination question first arose in 1793 , Washington and his Cabinet , which included Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson , embraced this view .All of them thought Washington could , on his own authority , terminate the treaty with France if necessary to keep the United States neutral .A second view holds that , as a matter of the general eighteenth - century understanding of the legal process , the power to take an action ( such as passing a statute or making a treaty ) implies the power to undo the action .This view would require the consent of the President and a supermajority of the Senate to undo a treaty .There is , however , not much historical evidence that many Framers actually held this view of treaty termination , and it is inconsistent with the common interpretation of the Appointments Clause ( under which Senate approval is required to appoint but not to remove executive officers ) .The third view is that the Congress as a whole has the power to terminate treaties , based on an analogy between treaties and federal laws .When the United States first terminated a treaty in 1798 under John Adams , this procedure was adopted , but there was little discussion of the constitutional ramifications .Finally , there is a question of the limits of the treaty power .A treaty presumably can not alter the constitutional structure of government , and the Supreme Court has said that executive agreements - and so apparently treaties - are subject to the limits of the Bill of Rights just as ordinary laws are .Reid v. Covert ( 1957 ) .In Geofroy v.
