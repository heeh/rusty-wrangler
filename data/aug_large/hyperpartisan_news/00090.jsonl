{"text": "Essentially , the story begins in late December 2001 when head speechwriter Mike Gerson gave Frum the assignment of articulating the case for dislodging the government of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in only a few sentences for the upcoming State of the Union address .Frum says he began by rereading President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's \" date that will live in infamy \" speech given on December 8 , 1941 , after the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor .While Americans needed no convincing about going to war with Japan , Roosevelt saw the greater threat to the United States coming from Germany , and he had to make the case for fighting a two - ocean war .Frum points to a now often - overlooked sentence in Roosevelt 's speech which reads in part , \" ... we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger us again .\" Frum interprets Roosevelt 's oratory like this : \" For FDR , Pearl Harbor was not only an attack - it was a warning of future and worse attacks from another , even more dangerous enemy . \"Saddam Hussein 's two wars , against Iran and Kuwait , were just as reckless , Frum believed , and therefore presented the same threat to world peace .The more he compared the Axis powers of World War II to modern \" terror states \" , the more similarities he saw . \" The Axis powers disliked and distrusted one another \" , Frum writes . \"Had the Axis somehow won the war , its members would quickly have turned on one another .\" Iran , Iraq , al - Qaeda , and Hezbollah , despite quarrelling among themselves however , \" all resented power of the West and Israel , and they all despised the humane values of democracy .\" There , Frum saw the connection : \" Together , the terror states and the terror organizations formed an axis of hatred against the United States .\" Frum sent off a memo with the above arguments and also cited some of the atrocities perpetrated by the Iraqi government .He expected his words to be chopped apart and altered beyond recognition , as is the fate of much presidential speechwriting , but his words were ultimately read by Bush nearly verbatim .His term \" axis of hatred \" had been changed to \" axis of evil \" to match the theological language used by Bush since the September 11 , 2001 attacks .North Korea was added to the list , he says , because it was attempting to develop nuclear weapons , had a history of reckless aggression , and \" needed to feel a stronger hand .\"A decade before the 2002 State of the Union address , in August 1992 , the neoconservative pundit Yossef Bodansky wrote a paper entitled \" Tehran , Baghdad & Damascus : The New Axis Pact \" [ 2 ] while serving as a staffer for a conservative House caucus .Although he did not explicitly apply the epithet \" evil \" to his New Axis , Bodansky 's axis was otherwise very reminiscent of Frum 's axis .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.19548"}

Feith and Seth Cropsey , writing in the July issue of Commentary , suggest that assumption no longer applies .Never in our history has there been a president who wanted to weaken America 's position relative to the rest of the world : until now .The Obama Doctrine Defined by the authors is that \" American leadership serving American interests abroad are not a proper guide for future conduct ....The United States should drop its obsession with its own national interests and concentrate on working for the world 's general good on an equal footing with other countries , recognizing that it is multinational bodies that grant legitimacy on the world stage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.69948"}

'So I believe that libertarians need to devise a foreign policy aimed at building a free world sooner rather than later .The true ultimate aim of such a policy would be to guarantee our liberties at home by removing the justifications for an intrusive national security apparatus . 'Looks like a win - win situation : greater freedom and prosperity all around .For Bailey , these considerations trump the notion of state sovereignty that has all - too often been used to justify repressive regimes .Before embracing this idea , though , let 's think through what would be required to actually carry it out .The agents of the interventionism Bailey supports will not , one suspects , be private firms or voluntary associations .Presumably , the U.S. , acting alone or with another ' coalition of the willing , ' will be the primary engine of this freedom revolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.956387"}

'Jordan defines an exit right as ' an exemption from some legally mandated practice , granted to a person or a group , the purpose of which is to protect the religious or moral integrity of that person or group . '[ i ] Examples of exit rights include conscientious objectors and home schoolers who have sought to be excused from state mandated activities .But we could expand the notion of an exit right to mean an exemption from a state mandated system of regulation and practice .The right to exit from a system that one finds tyrannical or that violates one 's moral convictions was offered as the justification for the American colonists ' separation from Great Britain .Such a right recognizes that no system of law is a perfect or closed system .There has to be room for experimentation and for dissent , and even for secession , individual or collective .The problem is that global interventionism , even in the name of libertarianism , will create a closed system , one from which there is no exit .If the terms of local sovereignty are contingent upon the good graces of the globalists in Washington , London , New York , or Brussels , there effectively is no local sovereignty .The right of exit , like the right of revolution , is one of the ultimate safeguards against the abuse of power .The erosion of national sovereignty in favor of supra - national entities threatens the very existence of this right .This is not to say that libertarians should make an idol of the nation as an end in itself .Ideally , sovereignty should be devolved to the state , local , community , and ultimately individual level .But until that happy day , national sovereignty should be defended from the depredations of those who feel called to run the world , even in the name of noble ideals .[ i ] Jeffrey Jordan , ' Is It Wrong to Discriminate on the Basis of Homosexuality ?

William Fulbright said in this respect : .\" If there is one factor that explains more than any other the tight spot in which we find ourselves , this factor is our disposition to utilize the specter of communism as a cloak to cover the failure of our own leadership .\" Thus we must seek in the necessity for expansion the reason for the existence of pacts like that of Rio de Janeiro .This is likewise the reason for the Inter - American Defense Board and the interventionist clauses in the Charter of the Organization of American States .Similarly hidden propositions are at the bottom of the Declaration of Caracas , making opinion a crime , ideas punishable , and imposing collective armed interventionism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.20566"}

{"text": "While we were on the wait list to see the speech specialist I set about doing as much as I could for my boy .I had his hearing tested and results showed middle ear dysfunction which was getting worse and so he had grommets inserted .This was meant to be our magical cure .I had heard and read all these wonderful stories of little ones with speech delay that started talking just days to weeks after the procedure ! !Oh how I could n't wait for that ! !It never happened , he remained as silent as ever .His speech assessment finally came round and his results for expressive language were very poor .He began therapy immediately .After four months of therapy and at just 26months of age his therapist confirmed that her suspicion of a motor planning problem was likely what we were facing .An assessment by a second therapist confirmed Childhood Apraxia of Speech .What causes it ?Why ... .Childhood Apraxia of speech is a neurological condition .From what I have read and from what has been explained to me , is that nothing I or anyone has done or has n't done can cause Apraxia .It may have been caused by an illness or infection before , during or after birth .It may be a characteristic from a genetic disorder or it may just be a case of cause unknown .For us it is likely a genetic reason .Both my older children have been diagnosed with Paroxysmal Tonic Upgaze ( PTU ) which is also a rather unknown neurological condition .Harrison presented with PTU symptoms at 10months of age .We will know more when we see his neurologist in a months time and ask some more questions .Our concern for our third child ( Bubba , 9months ) is also weighing on our minds .The guilt of being genetically responsible for passing on these conditions is unbearable at the moment .I know I could n't do anything to change it and I know in the scheme of things we are so very lucky , it could be so much worse .I know in time I will let that go .So what now ?What can be done ?Is it curable ?What should I do ?Where should I go ?How much ?What if ?What if ?What if ?I am still answering these questions and for every question answered a new one pops up .I have been reassured that these children can learn to speak and can catch up to their peers in some cases , not all .However with early ( and we did pick it up very early ) intervention , highly intensive therapy and lots and lots and lots of support , encouragement and guidance by all around them , they stand a fighting chance .And we will fight !We wo nt give up !It is common for children with Apraxia to also have delays with gross motor and fine motor skills .Currently Hman sees a highly trained and experienced speech therapist weekly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "122.40576"}
