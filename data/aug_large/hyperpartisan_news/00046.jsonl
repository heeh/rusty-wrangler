{"text": "\" Someone has to look out for the people you abandon , who better than me ?I 'll be the patron saint of the Doctor 's leftovers , \" she told him .She also says , \" While you 're busy protecting this world , I 'll get busy protecting it from you .\" When the Doctor expresses that he thinks he 's very glad he saved her life , she replies , rather ominously , \" I think everyone will be .\" This could make her an interesting recurring character , and provides job security should she be killed off on Game of Thrones .She is present in the background of a picture at Clara 's school shown at the end of the episode .I 'll accept the coincidence that she is present in the first picture that Clara showed him after this encounter , but what about all the companions prior to Clara ?While that probably can not be shown on screen , she could be an interesting addition to books or fan fiction .With Jenna Coleman reportedly leaving after this season , possibly Maise Williams will play a part .The above trailer announces that the long - awaited Victorian version of Sherlock will air on January 1 in both the UK and the Unites States and will be named The Abominable Bride .I 'm going to post this link without reading the article .I have n't looked at the deleted scenes on the Blu Ray of Avengers : Age of Ultron yet , and will do so before reading this , but Den of Geek has a detailed description for those who might want to read about them without viewing .After a bunch of teasers , Netflix has released a full trailer for Jessica Jones ( video above ) .I avoid watching Amazon pilots until a series is about to be released in full , but I am really looking forward to The Man In The High Castle .Reviews of the pilot have been fantastic .Now Amazon is going to make the first two episodes available , even to non - prime members , here from 12 am Pacific on Friday , October 23rd until 11:59pm Pacific on Sunday , October 25th .The first two episodes will remain available to Prime members , with full release on November 20 .Many evenings I do not go beyond my Roku box for watching television .This raised another thought .When traveling I prefer either a Roku box , or my Roku stick to travel more lightly , as it has all the streaming services I use set up conveniently .It includes Amazon Prime , while some competing devices do not .I also do have both a Google Chromecast and an Amazon Fire Stick .( This comes in handy when staying in friends ' condos in Florida which have televisions in the bedroom and living room ) .I have also found the Amazon Fire Stick essential when traveling to hotels which require a sign on to use their WiFi .Only the Amazon Fire Stick can handle this without resorting to making a hot spot with a travel router .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.650406"}
{"text": "This will not be the only case of Lauren Graham being united with a star from a previous show .She will reunite with Mae Whitman of Parenthood in an adaption of the The Royal We , a book on the courthouse of Prince William and Kate Middleton .Maureen O'Hara , the spirited Irish - born actress who played strong - willed , tempestuous beauties opposite all manner of adventurers in escapist movies of the 1940s and ' 50s , died on Saturday at her home in Boise , Idaho .She was 95 ... .Ms. O'Hara was called the Queen of Technicolor , because when that film process first came into use , nothing seemed to show off its splendor better than her rich red hair , bright green eyes and flawless peaches - and - cream complexion .One critic praised her in an otherwise negative review of the 1950 film \" Comanche Territory \" with the sentiment \" Framed in Technicolor , Miss O'Hara somehow seems more significant than a setting sun .\" Even the creators of the process claimed her as its best advertisement .Yet many of the films that made the young Ms. O'Hara a star were in black and white .If Bernie Sanders had his way , he would only be speaking about the first issue during this campaign .He is learning that he can not be a single - issue candidate and must broaden his appeal ( as I discussed after his performance in the first Democratic debate ) .Bernie Sanders has frequently championed economic issues , has often spoken out on Clinton 's pro - war stance , and has now become a more reluctant culture warrior and hero to secularists in this campaign .Sanders appeared much more comfortable in this position when appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live last week .To the shock of conservatives , and delight of secularists , Sanders downplayed the role of religion .Kimmel asked , \" You say you 're culturally Jewish - you do n't feel religious .Do you believe in God , and do you think that 's important to the people of the United States ? \"Sanders answered : .I am who I am and what I believe in and what my spirituality is about is that we 're all in this together .That I think it is not a good thing to believe that as human beings we can turn our backs on the suffering of other people .This is not Judaism - this is what Pope Francis is talking about - that we can not worship just billionaires and the making of more and more money .Life is more than that .While discussing social / cultural issues , Sanders also said he is \" not unfavorably disposed to moving towards the legalization of marijuana \" when asked by Kimmel .He came out strongly against the drug war in pointing out , \" We have more people in jail today than any other country on Earth . \"He also said , \" We have large numbers of lives that have been destroyed because of this war on drugs and because people were caught smoking marijuana and so forth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.7706"}
