Bush and advisor to Sarah Palin .In addition , he is closely affiliated with ultra - conservatives like the Koch brothers and Breitbart News .However , there is another highly motivated player in this well - coordinated attack campaign that is getting less attention .Rupert Murdoch , chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox , commands a vast empire of media businesses that share a determined leaning toward activist , far - right politics .So it is not surprising that a committed conservative like Schweizer would integrate himself into the Murdoch machine .As a result , the opportunities for propaganda and profit become plentiful .Schweizer 's book was published by HarperCollins , which is owned by Murdoch 's News Corp.So making the book a bestseller puts cash directly into Murdoch 's wallet .To that end , Murdoch has exploited his own Fox News which has gone into overdrive promoting the book .Schweizer has become an almost daily fixture on the network , and when he is n't there himself , the network hands those promotional duties to their anchors and guests .All told , Fox News has donated the equivalent of more than $ 107 million to the marketing of the book , according to an analysis by Media Matters .And speaking Fox News , the network produced and aired its own hour - long special ( The Tangled Clinton Web ) that served as an unabashed infomercial for the book .And rather than assigning a political personality like Sean Hannity to the brazenly partisan project , it was hosted by Fox 's chief news anchor , Bret Baier .The program was repeated several times .So while running PR for the book , Fox News is also chasing ratings and advertising dollars from the book 's rollout .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.04291"}

'( Jeremiah Wright claims Obama ally offered $ 150,000 bribe in 2008 to shut up ; by Ed Morrissey ; Hot Air , 5/13/12 - READ ENTIRE POST ) .The big question is : Will the mainstream media step in to report this legitimate news story and force Obama to do more than call Wright a liar ?I am certain Obama will paint Wright as bathing in sour grapes .What I want to know is Obama willing to sue Wright for defamation ?If not , then Obama is the liar .BUT we all know Obama is a liar .Below is CJ 's post at AC2C which is an amalgamation a Theodore 's World post of the Hannity - Klein radio interview and Ed Lasky 's American Thinker article .I am to going to take the editorial liberty to also include Wild Thing 's Theodore 's World comment not included in CJ 's post .Rev. Jeremiah Wright Says of Obama , \" I made it Comfortable for Him to Accept Christianity without having to Renounce His Islamic Background \" .Here is audio of Edward Klein , author of \" The Amateur , \" talking with Sean Hannity about his new book and his interview with Rev. Jeremiah Wright .Klein interviewed Wright for more than three hours for the book , and says he has much of it on tape .Klein reports that Wright told him that he could not say he \" converted \" Obama to Christianity , but that \" I made it comfortable for him to accept Christianity without having to renounce his Islamic background .\" [ Wild Thing 's comment ....... .Like Tom says OBama is a Muslim .The thing is we have learned that with Isalm ( sic ) Obama or anyone would be threatened and very possibly taken out if they were Muslim and turned away from their beliefs .They have done it enough times that we should believe them .IMO Obama would have a very tuff time if he was ever really vetted to prove he was NOT a Muslim .His actions , associations , his administration that is heavy with Muslims and so many things prove it along with what this Rev. Wright has said ... imo . ]Klein 's book begins with a talisman - like quote uttered by Barack Obama when his recently appointed Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner tried to boost Obama 's ego by telling him , \" Your legacy is going to be preventing the second Great Depression . \"To which Barack Obama responded , \" That 's not enough for me . \" As all of America knows by now , Obama has aggressively sought to \" fundamentally transform \" America - one of the few promises he has kept from the days of 2008 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.679085"}

TYPES OF ELECTION CRIMES .Election Fraud .Election fraud usually involves corruption of one of three processes : the obtaining and marking of ballots , the counting and certification of election results , or the registration of voters .C. FEDERAL JURISDICTION .The federal government asserts jurisdiction over an election offense to ensure that basic rights of United States citizenship , and a fundamental process of representative democracy , remain uncorrupted .Election crime cases tend to be long - term prosecutive projects focusing on individuals with different degrees of culpability .The ultimate goal is to move up the ladder of culpability to candidates , political operatives , public officials , and others who attempted to corrupt , or did corrupt , the public office involved .Federal jurisdiction over election fraud is easily established in elections when a federal candidate is on the ballot .The mere listing of a federal candidate 's name on a ballot is sufficient under most of the federal statutes used to prosecute voter fraud to satisfy federal jurisdiction .This generally occurs in what are called \" mixed \" elections , when federal and nonfederal candidates are running simultaneously .In short , the absence of a federal candidate from the ballot can present federal law enforcement with special challenges in attaining federal jurisdiction over election crime .Those challenges can sometimes be met , provided the investigation focuses on identifying additional facts that are needed to invoke application of the federal criminal laws that potentially apply to both federal and nonfederal elections .These generally include election frauds that involve the necessary participation of public officers , notably election officials acting \" under color of law , \" voting by noncitizens , and fraudulently registering voters .If McDaniel insists on a Federal criminal investigation for a United States Senate election Holder 's Justice Department is obligated to investigate .BUT we all know Holder has n't been too keen on enforcing the law pertaining to corruption and on matters of the Republican Party unless perhaps he sees an opportunity to embarrass Republicans .Here is the email alert I received from the Tea Party Leadership Fund today posted below .In full disclosure and as is usual the case in an email alert there is an element of fund raising involved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.74249"}
