Ted Cruz , R - Texas .Cruz said Feinstein 's bill would create exceptions to the Second Amendment and asked her if she would favor exemptions to the First Amendment 's freedom of speech by denying that right to certain books .\" I 'm not a sixth - grader , \" said a visibly upset Feinstein .She described her decades in Congress involved in gun control debates and said , \" I 'm reasonably well - educated , and thank you for the lecture . \"Several Republicans including Sen. John Cornyn of Texas , who proposed the GOP amendments that were defeated , argued that the most effective approach to curbing gun violence would be to improve how mental health records are sent to the federal system that checks backgrounds of potential gun buyers .Cornyn also said that as a result of Feinstein 's ban , criminals would still get the weapons .\" We 're going to give American citizens a pea shooter to defend themselves with , \" Cornyn said .Feinstein conceded that the battle to enact her measure would be difficult and said , \" I do n't see that as being bad .I do n't see that as harming Americans .Because we have so many guns .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.717064"}

O'Rourke Parliament of Whores .In talking about the crack epidemic , he spoke to a doctor on the front lines about what he 'd do if were the drug czar .The doctor said he would make a big splash about something unrelated like assault weapons and wait for the problem to burn itself out .O'Rourke noted that this was exactly what William Bennett subsequently did .Assault weapon bans - indeed gun controls in general - are and always have been a distraction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.54867"}
