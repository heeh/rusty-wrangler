{"text": "The White House continues to deny they changed the language in those talking points away from the probability that it was a terrorist attack .Obviously , they ca n't both be telling the truth .One week earlier , Petraeus resigned as the Director of the CIA in light of an FBI investigation of Petraeus involving an affair with his 40-year - old biographer Paula Broadwell .The investigation into Petraeus began earlier in the summer and the FBI determined fairly quickly , by late summer at the latest , that the affair did not create a security breach .Absent a security breach , the FBI argued last week that it was appropriate not to notify Congress or the White House earlier .According to the White House , it was n't informed of the FBI investigation that involved Petraeus until Election Day , Nov. 6 .The very fact that the White House was kept out of the loop has caused the appearance of a cover up by the Justice Department , timing the release of the information to the White House until after the election .The concern has more to do with Petraeus ' role in the investigation of the Benghazi attack than any concerns over the propinquitous relationship between the general and his now infamous biographer .There has emerged over the past week a difference in the story between Petraeus and the Obama White House over who characterized the Benghazi attack as a spontaneous protest which got out of hand .The White House has argued all along that they were not intentionally misleading the American people .If the testimony of General Petraeus is to be believed , it would appear that the Obama administration , on their own , made a deliberate decision to state and restate the claim that the attack was spontaneous and grew out of a demonstration against an anti - Islam video .This claim was made by the President , the Secretary of State and UN Ambassador Susan Rice .If the claim is proven false , some believe the Obama Administration wanted at all costs to avoid a narrative that undermined their foreign policy claims , and an al - Qaida attack on Benghazi would have been damaging to the President 's re - election chances .Other observers argue that there is no evidence Petraeus was pushed out because of his role in the Benghazi response .The fact that he resigned right after the election and right before another closed - door Benghazi hearing is simply a coincidence .Since there was no evidence of a security breach and simply an affair , those observers argue the FBI was correct in not informing the President earlier .Forum Question of the Week : .Should the FBI have reported to President Obama once General Petraeus became the target of their investigation ?Is the Petraeus scandal in the news now simply because it was being conveniently delayed until after the election ?Scandal : If it ai n't there , fabricate it !By Marianne Stanley .AUGH !Once again , we have a trumped up story about nefarious and imaginary shenanigans by the Obama administration .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.374092"}

{"text": "The way federal agencies delegate FOIA decision authority varies widely .Some departments assign the handling of FOIA requests to separate agencies or divisions that make up that department .For example , within the Department of Justice , that would include such agencies as the FBI , DEA , ATF , Bureau of Prisons , Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys , and so forth .Sometimes other smaller subunits , such as the office of the secretary or the FOIA office itself are separated out .In other instances the suborganizations are defined geographically when FOIA processing is decentralized regionally .Other organizations do n't delegate FOIA authority and handle FOIA administration centrally .In these cases , the organization and suborganization are one and the same .See a complete list of the organizations and suborganizations we used .( Note : when possible , if an agency has moved departments or been reorganized , we tried to apply the categories applicable to its current configuration , even though the suit may have originated prior to this change . )For lawsuits , this classification is based on the defendants explicitly named in the lawsuit .Sometimes lawsuits only formally sue the department as a whole - Department of Justice , Homeland Security , Defense , etc . - rather than the component(s ) within the department - FBI , ICE , Army , etc . , that withheld the records .Because of this , the counts for suborganizations may under - represent the number of times that component 's withholding is being challenged in court .Lawsuits that only name the department and do not name the actual component that withheld the record appear under the \" suborganization \" category with \" ( overall ) \" following the department 's name .Not a Federal Agency .Sometimes the defendants sued were not federal agencies .When this occurred the category \" Not a federal agency \" was used .This category reflects cases where no federal agency ( or federal official sued in his / her official capacity ) was named as a defendant in the suit even though the nature of the suit for the case had been classified under the FOIA category .Sometimes these involved pro se cases filed by individuals without an attorney where the records being sought were from some nonfederal governmental body - such as a state agency or a local police or sheriff 's department .In other cases , while a federal body was sued it was n't subject to FOIA - for example , federal courts or Congress itself .Finally , in some cases , there was ambiguity over whether a particular federal body was subject to FOIA .This can be a complex issue , particularly for example , when it comes to identifying which of the many organizations in the White House are subject to the Act .These we classified as \" Not a federal agency \" if that body did not file annual FOIA reports .( If this is an area of particular interest or about which you have expertise , TRAC would welcome volunteers to make recommendations on how our classification might be improved in areas where ambiguities concerning FOIA 's coverage exist . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.36276"}
