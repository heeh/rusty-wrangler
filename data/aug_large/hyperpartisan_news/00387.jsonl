{"text": "So , at the urging of Senators John McCain of Arizona and Carl Levin of Michigan , the IG launched a second probe .The inquiry was completed three months ago , about one year after Moseley was fired as Chief of Staff .After reviewing the report , Air Force Secretary Michael Donley imposed the letter of admonishment , and announced his decision this week .But that begs an obvious question : does General Moseley deserve the delayed punishment ?On one hand , the admonishment appears to be a blow for accountability -- something sorely lacking in the Air Force in recent years .By sanctioning Moseley in retirement , Secretary Donley reminded USAF personnel that accountability continues -- even after they hang up the uniform .On the other hand , the punishment handed out to Mike Moseley is somewhere below that proverbial \" slap - on - the - wrist .\" General Moseley left active duty last summer ; he 'll never hold a command position or face another promotion board .So , the admonishment is little more than an exercise in public humiliation for a man who was fired as Chief of Staff .From that perspective , this week 's punishment could be viewed as piling on -- and an effort to appease Congressional critics .That 's why we wonder if the Moseley case could have been handled in another manner .The General was still under investigation by the IG at the time of his retirement in 2008 .If the allegations against Moseley were serious ( and they were ) , why was n't the general retained on active duty ( in a special assistant post ) , pending outcome of the IG probe .Imposing punishment on an active - duty flag officer would have far greater impact than a letter mailed to a retired general .But we 're guessing that was part of the plan .The IG investigation represented a bit of unfinished business that needed to be wrapped up .And Defense Secretary Robert Gates had no desire to let Moseley linger on active duty , given his perceived failings in the Air Force 's nuclear debacle .So , General Moseley got the boot last summer , pushing the Thundervision probe to the back burner -- something to be resolved down the road .And for that reason , we question the letter of admonishment .In our view , a general officer under investigation should not be allowed to retire , though it 's happened on several occasions .Nor should a flag officer be allowed to move on to new assignments -- something General Goldfein did twice during the Thundervision inquiry .In fact , military regulations specifically prohibit retirements or transfers when a service member is the target of an official probe .So , why was Moseley allowed to retire last summer and why did Goldfein move on to jobs as Vice Commander of Air Combat Command and Vice Director of the Joint Staff before retirement ?Those are the two , unanswered questions of Thundervision and quite frankly , we do n't expect any resolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.052124"}

CROWLEY , FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS : Yes , he did .I mean the president 's policy is to assist in the removal of Moammar Gadhafi .The issue is not with the policy , the issue is the mechanism .We 're acting in a limited manner to level the playing field so the Libyan people themselves and the opposition that has formed , they 'll do that job .It 's not for the United States to impose that from the outside .MORGAN : I mean you 're a former Air Force colonel .You worked with NATO in Kosovo .Do you think that the way this coalition has now been constructed is likely to be an effective one ?CROWLEY : I mean Kosovo is a very good example of where we did a bombing for 79 days .It created conditions that eventually led to the ouster of Milosevic but it was ultimately , you know , the people of Serbia who did that , you know , not the United States .We 're using military action decisively but ultimately the removal of Gadhafi will be one that 's , through a variety of tools , economic and political , while applying the military pressure that we 're currently applying .MORGAN : It 's an unusual state of affairs for America and , indeed , NATO to get involve in preventing a humanitarian disaster before it 's even started to happen .Are you absolutely confident that what everyone assumes was going to happen in Benghazi is what was going to happen ?CROWLEY :Well , if you look at Egypt , the fundamental decision -- why Egypt worked the way it was is because the Egyptian military , from the outset , said very clearly , we are not going to turn our weapons on our own people .Gadhafi chose a different path ., through a combination of armor and aviation , he was in fact turning his weapons on his own people .And that 's what separates Gadhafi from other leaders in the region .MORGAN : Presumably , given that 's what 's happening in Syria and Yemen , you would want to go in there as well , would you ?CROWLEY : Understand the predicates to military action .We got a very strong statement in the GCC and Arab League and a very strong resolution from the U.N.

{"text": "While acknowledging that many female sailors are simply trying to balance a naval career against their desire to start a family , others are gaming the system , they say .In some cases , they say female sailors become pregnant to avoid a projected deployment , or get out of an assignment they do n't like .Years ago , sailors who became pregnant while on active duty were immediately dismissed from the service .By comparison , today 's family - friendly Navy goes to great lengths to accommodate pregnant sailors , and there 's not much a Captain or Master Chief can do except grit their teeth and suck it up .You 'd think the IG report would offer a cautionary tale for the submarine force and its plan for mixed - gender crews .Running an attack boat or a boomer takes an exceptionally well - trained , cohesive team of officers and enlisted members .Simply stated , the silent service ca n't afford the kind of turnover caused by pregnancies in other Navy organizations .But such concerns are being ignored in the rush to break down one last bastion of male service .Sub skippers and Chiefs of the Boat know what 's on the way , but speaking out would be a career killer .If the IG 's findings are any indication , we 'll soon be reading about training , turnover and reliability problems in the sub fleet , thanks to female crew members who decided to get pregnant .According to David Ignatius of the Washington Post , Iran may not be as close to a nuclear weapon as we might believe .In a column published last Friday , Mr. Ignatius reported that Tehran 's supply of low - enriched uranium -- the potential feedstock for a nuclear weapon -- has impurities that could cause centrifuges to break , if the Iranians attempt to raise it to weapons grade .That assessment is based on a recent article in Nucleonics Week , a nuclear industry trade publication .Sources tell the magazine ( published by a division of McGraw - Hill ) that Iran has been unable to remove all traces of molybdenum from the gaseous form of uranium , produced at a plant near Esfahan .After being converted to a gas , the uranium is enriched in centrifuges at the Natanz complex , and ( presumably ) , a similar plant , recently discovered near the holy city of Qom .But if Iran 's existing stockpile of LEU is contaminated , that would greatly hinder efforts to produce a nuclear bomb .Building a bomb 's nuclear core from highly enriched uranium -- Tehran 's most viable option at present -- would require decontaminating remaining supplies of low - enriched uranium .That process could take years to complete , meaning that Iran may not be on the threshold of producing its first nuclear weapon .The contamination problem may also provide an explanation for Iran 's sudden willingness to go along with western proposals for uranium enrichment .At a preliminary meeting on its nuclear program ( held in Geneva earlier this month ) , Tehran tentatively agreed to send its LEU to Russia , where it would be raised to the 19.75 % purity level , required for use in medical isotopes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.955215"}

{"text": "The measure , co - sponsored by 14 Senators , would prevent interest from accruing on the loans of military personnel -- including members of the National Guard -- while they serve on active duty .According to Washington Monthly , the interest free period would be limited to 60 months , and generate an average savings of $ 1,100 - 1,400 for each military member .To some degree , VerBruggen has a point , though his argument is poorly focused .For starters , we 'll assume that the student loans in question were used before the individual joined the military .With generous tuition assistance for active duty personnel ( and GI Bill benefits for those on active service and qualified veterans ) , there should be little need for personnel in those categories to take out student loans .Additionally , virtually all of the services have student loan forgiveness programs for new enlistees .By signing up for a specified period of service , new troops can have their students loans wiped away -- and still qualify for active - duty education benefits .Instead of offering an interest - free period , it might be more practical to expand the loan forgiveness programs .In terms of raising pay , VerBruggen 's proposal would create something of a problem .Special pay -- including re - enlistment bonuses -- is paid to service members who possess specific skills , or volunteer for particular career fields .There is no precedent ( that we know of ) to pay Private Smith an extra $ 200 a month to service interest on his student loan , while his comrade gets less compensation because they do n't have education debt .Besides , if National Review is genuinely concerned about disparity and waste in the DoD education budget , they 're barking up the wrong tree .We would suggest a closer look at the Tuition Assistance ( TA ) program for military personnel , which provides up to $ 4,500 a year for the cost of college classes .Tuition assistance has been around for decades , and ( overall ) it has been a highly successful program .Thousands of military personnel have earned college degrees , enhancing their skills and those of the military as a whole .For years , TA compensation was capped at 75 % of a course 's tuition costs .Military members picked up the rest , and paid for incidental costs , including books and technology fees .To help service members , many colleges offered discounted tuition rates and book scholarships , reducing out - of - pocket costs .In 2002 , the military decided to raise the payment rate from 75 % to 100 % of tuition costs .Pentagon officials viewed it as a necessity ; with an improving civilian economy ( and increased operations tempo associated with the War on Terror ) , increased TA rates were deemed essential to the military 's recruiting and retention strategy .Besides , conventional wisdom suggested that the expanded program would n't cost that much .In early 2002 , one of the Air Force 's highest - ranking budget officers predicted that the new TA program would require ( at most ) a 25 % increase in funding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.6821"}

'nuff said .remember that the context is that both McCain and Romney ( Clinton too if I recall ) - went after Obama hard on his statement that he 'd go into Pakistan to get bin Laden if given a chance .This was a major talking point , remember ?That Obama was naive , did n't understand international relations or the military , and so on .That picture of President Obama et al . still reminds me of when one of the youngster would come over to the adults ' table at Christmas dinner .Back in my military daze , there was a bit of folk wisdom that went \" Lead , follow , or stand out of the way .\" The last is probably the best I can do for President Obama .You folks at least nominally pretend to respect the military side of the Bin Laden raid , so then have the decency to take Adm.

{"text": "However , we had at least one \" census imposter \" who tried to get into a local home during the operation -- we found out only because the home owner knew one of my crew leaders and contacted him .That 's something else the Census Bureau does n't like to admit ; the decennial process also attracts con men and crooks who pose as listers , and trek through neighborhoods in search of potential victims .Correspondent Jonathan Karl reports that the Pentagon is shifting resources from other programs to speed development of the so - called Massive Ordnance Penetrator ( MOP ) , a weapon that went into development just two years ago .Dropped by a B-2 bomber , the 30,000 pound bomb is designed to take out deeply - buried and hardened facilities -- like Iran 's recently - disclosed uranium processing facility near Qom .When the project was first announced in 2007 , the Defense Department said it had an \" urgent need \" for a weapon that could target such facilities .Now , the MOP program has taken on an even greater urgency .In a budget \" reprogramming \" request submitted earlier this year , DoD asked Congress to transfer almost $ 70 million from other accounts , to accelerate development of the bunker - buster bomb , designed the GBU-57A / B. That total includes $ 19.1 million to buy four of the weapons ; $ 28.3 million to accelerate the bomb 's development and testing , and $ 21 million to integrate the weapon into the B-2 bomber fleet .But that does n't mean a stealth bomber will be dropping a MOP on the Qom facility ( or Iran 's primary enrichment complex at Natanz ) any time soon .Production , integration and testing take time , even on an accelerated timeline .Defense Industry Daily recently reported that the program is about 10 months behind schedule , because of problems associated with bomb racks on test aircraft .Apparently , the MOP is so big that the racks had to be redesigned to accommodate the weapon .With that problem now solved , contractors will conduct test drops from B-52s , before final integration on the B-2 .Each stealth bomber will be capable of carrying two of the massive weapons .At this point , it 's hard to say when the giant bomb will be available -- though the additional funding is clearly aimed at compressing the development process .And , it 's worth remembering that ordnance programs can sometimes achieve operational status in relatively short order .In the run - up to the first Gulf War , Air Force engineers quickly converted a 8 inch artillery shell into a guided bomb , aimed at destroying bunkers used as a hideout by Saddam Hussein .After only a few weeks of development , a prototype weapon was declared ready for action and flown , non - stop , from McClellan AFB , California , to Taif AB , Saudi Arabia , where deployed F-111s were stationed .Acting on fleeting intelligence , the weapon was off - loaded from a C-141 transport and mounted on an F-111 that was preparing to launch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.3714"}

{"text": "Iran - Saudi tensions were escalating throughout 2015 .The mediatory role of Islamabad was quite understandable .In the past , Islamabad repeatedly declared the inadmissibility of a military intervention in a conflict on the side of any state within the Muslim Ummah .Secondly , it was caused by Iran 's reaction to the establishment of an anti - terrorist alliance under the leadership of the KSA in December 2015 .Islamabad was registered as its member , but it learned about it from statements of officials in Riyadh .The list included 34 more states , with the exception of Iraq , Iran and Syria .As the Saudi authorities explained later on , these countries had not been invited because of a lack of confidence in them .Pakistan demonstrated impartiality during the growing tension between the two countries .Riyadh 's request to send several thousand Pakistani soldiers at the disposal of the authorities of the KSA changed the subsequent course of events .Islamabad immediately canceled a visit of the civilian Defense Minister H. Asif to Tehran in mid - January this year .In a short time , the Pakistani military and , in particular , the Army Chief of Staff General R. Sharif , initiated a project of mediation in the Iran - Saudi conflict .On January 18 this year , two Sharifs ( the namesakes - Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff General R. Sharif ) visited Riyadh with a mission to settle disputes by peaceful means in the interest of the unity of the Muslims in these difficult times .The next day , on January 19 , the civil and military leadership of Pakistan arrived in Tehran .It is fair to say that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was the first world leader who visited Iran after the lifting of sanctions .The mediation of Pakistan yielded positive results .On January 20 , 2016 , the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly condemned the attack on the embassy of the KSA in Tehran for the first time .It seems that Riyadh and Iran heard each other thanks to the efforts of the intermediary .But instead of a triumph , Islamabad 's diplomacy failed once again .On January 25 , 2016 , Minister of Foreign Affairs of the KSA Adel Al Dzhubeir said that Tehran was pursuing a hostile policy towards the Arab world , and interfered in the internal affairs of foreign countries inciting religious strife and supporting terrorism .Of course , the efforts of Islamabad turned out to be useless against this background .On his return from a tour of Iran and Saudi Arabia , Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif refused to extend General R.Sharif 's term of office .The army commander had nothing to do but to publicly declare his refusal to continue service and his retirement upon reaching the retirement age .The generals of Pakistan are one of the strongest and most masterful government institutions and have seized power in the country four times ; the Army Chief of Staff is the de facto first person in the state .Thus , the completion of the anti - terrorist campaign initiated by General R.Sharif delivered has been jeopardized .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.80968"}

{"text": "Looking across the street , I could see people in the gold section , crowded into their little section of the Mall .3rd Street was kept empty .The amount of fencing erected for this event must add up to dozens and dozens of miles .All kinds of fencing , and of course lots of concrete barriers too .People sitting on a concrete barricade .My section was next to the Capitol reflecting pool , but of course there was yet another fence preventing us from getting too close .Maybe they were afraid someone would try to swim to freedom .Empty space by the Capitol reflecting pool .There were jumbotrons at the north and south ends of our area .I got to see Beyonc\u00e9 sing the national anthem .Beyonc\u00e9 on the Jumbotron .When the ceremony was over , I decided to venture onto to Mall to see if there was anything interesting .I walked one block west to 4th St , by the National Gallery of Art .But 4th St was completely blocked off .More fencing ! 4thSt & Madison Dr NW .When I turned around to head back to the 3rd St entrance , someone put his hand on my shoulder and told me I was n't allowed to walk that way .He did n't identify himself , but it was one of those security goons ( shown below ) .I was shocked someone would lay a hand on me .Is n't that a form of assault ?And it was completely idiotic that we would n't be allowed to walk east on Madison Dr - this was after the ceremony had even ended !Why would anyone prevent people from entering the ticketed areas after the event had ended ?Furthermore , he did n't care that I had come from the ticketed area that I was trying to return to .This was the most idiotic , frustrating moment of the day .This guy would n't let me turn back .So I continued west .It was n't until 7th St that we were able to turn north .7th St NW .At 7th St and Constitution Ave , a guy with a bullhorn said to turn right to enter the parade area , and left to go to Metro .I certainly was n't in the mood for a parade after this , so I headed further west on Constitution Ave . .At 10th St & Constitution Ave , I got a closer look at one of the entry points for viewing the parade .Yet another screening tent , but this one had big signs saying \" Achtung ! \"- I mean , \" Attention ! \" , adding \" by entering this secured area you are consenting to a search of your person and your belongings .\" This in order to walk on a public street .No thanks . 10thSt & Constitution Dr NW .At 12th St & Constitution Ave , it seemed as if I had found a way north .Signs indicated this was the way to Metro ; I figured one could n't go further north than the Federal Triangle Metro station , since the parade route had been completely closed since the morning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.65575"}
