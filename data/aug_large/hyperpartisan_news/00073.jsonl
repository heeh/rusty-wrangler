{"text": "_ _ _ .AP White House correspondent Julie Pace in Chicago contributed to this report .WASHINGTON ( AP ) - Hillary Rodham Clinton jumped back into presidential politics on Sunday , making a much - awaited announcement she will again seek the White House with a promise to serve as the \" champion \" of everyday Americans .And unlike eight years ago , when she ran as a candidate with a deep resume in Washington , Clinton and her personal history were n't the focus of the first message of her campaign .In the online video that kicked off her campaign , she made no mention of her time in the Senate and four years as secretary of state , or the prospect she could make history as the nation 's first female president .Instead , the video is collection of voters talking about their lives , their plans and aspirations for the future .Clinton does n't appear until the very end .\" I 'm getting ready to do something , too .I 'm running for president , \" Clinton said .\" Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times , but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top .Every day Americans need a champion , and I want to be that champion , so you can do more than just get by .You can get ahead and stay ahead .It 's a message that also made an immediate play to win over the support of liberals in her party for whom economic inequality has become a defining issue .They remain skeptical of Clinton 's close ties to Wall Street and the centrist economic policies of the administration of her husband , former President Bill Clinton .Many had hoped Clinton would face a challenge from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who has said she will not run .Unlike some of the Republicans who have entered the race , Clinton was scant on policy specifics on her first day as a candidate .Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul , for example , kicked off his campaign with a website and online videos that described his positions on an array of domestic and foreign policy issues .Clinton also began her campaign for president in 2007 with a video , followed by a splashy rally in Des Moines where she said , \" I 'm running for president , and I 'm in it to win it .\" This time around , Clinton will instead head this week to the first - to - vote Iowa , looking to connect with voters directly at a community college and small business roundtable in two small towns .When families are strong , America is strong .So I 'm hitting the road to earn your vote .Because it 's your time .And I hope you 'll join me on this journey , \" she said in the video .This voter - centric approach was picked with a purpose , her advisers said , to show that Clinton is not taking the nomination for granted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "28.414433"}

Kerry of Massachusetts , best known to the outside world as the man who failed to beat George W. Bush in the 2004 election .As a steadfast and reliable member of the United States Senate since his election in 1984 and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Kerry would appear to be a safe pair of hands to take over at the State Department once Hillary Clinton departs .Like Hillary , Kerry will be a well - known public face with a long - standing record of public service , a distinguished war record in Vietnam and with an excellent appreciation of the nation , its place in the world and its foreign relations .As one would expect from a senator from Massachusetts , his voting record is generally to the left , but this is not expected to be of any great significance when he ( presumably ) takes office .There is speculation that he could enhance the concept of digital diplomacy , which would be a boost tot his concept .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.34227"}

Bush won the Texas governorship , and Jeb Bush barely lost in Florida .Had Jeb won , it 's likely he would have been the Bush running for president in 2000 .Would he have won ?Maybe .And while it 's damning with faint praise , most observers do believe that Jeb is the more competent of the Bush brothers .Since leaving office , Jeb has made a living acting like someone who is aware of reality , arguing in favor of immigration reform , and saying he 'd be willing to accept some revenue increases as part of a budget deal .Of course , he 's also praised his brother , so he 's not entirely reality - based - but he at least has a passing familiarity with the concept .There 's no guarantee that Bush runs , but if he does , he 's got the Bush network that he can plug into .That alone will scare off a number of potential candidates .If Jeb is the candidate , he 's probably the standard - bearer for the hacks , and we might get a chance to see whether America is ready for four more years of Bushes .( Spoiler alert : we are n't . )Marco Rubio is a good public speaker and pretty charismatic , but that 's not why he 's being touted by GOPers .No , Rubio is on the short list because he 's Latino , and if 2012 has taught the GOP anything , it 's that they desperately need to win over Latinos .If they nominate Rubio , the thinking goes , Latinos will rush to vote for Republicans for the same reason whites rushed to vote for Mitt Romney .That said , Republicans are wrong if they think Rubio will automatically win over Latino voters .Believe it or not , Latinos vote based on issues , and on the issues , Rubio has been out of step with the majority of them .Hispanic voters are not likely to embrace a candidate who has his roots in the anti - immigration , Tea Party wing of the party , any more than African American voters would have embraced Herman Cain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.700836"}

{"text": "As the son of Cuban immigrants , Rubio has a fascinating narrative and is well positioned to take full advantage of his heritage , youth , and position as senator for the key state of Florida heading into 2016 .Accordingly , this visit was all about establishing international credibility and elevating the senator in the eyes of potential kingmakers in the GOP .Senior parliamentarians with whom he met were understood to have been impressed , although those who had not met with him were heard to mutter in the corridors of power ' Is n't he a bit of a nutter ? 'Well , the simple answer is , no , he is n't , and it is concerning that such a view was being aired so openly .Whilst the depth of the senator 's grasp of the issues was never tested , his breadth of knowledge and the span of the talk were more than sufficient .Cuba was mentioned just once , clearly signalling that Rubio is seeking to position himself not as the Cuban candidate , but simply as a candidate who happens to be of Cuban extraction .He will , doubtless , reap an electoral windfall from the huge influx of Latino voters who are expected to form a huge voting bloc in 2016 .One wonders in what capacity London will next welcome Marco Rubio to these shores ?In November 2012 , Barack Obama won re - election to a second term as President of the United States .Since then , many have been eagerly awaiting confirmation as to who he would name to the key foreign policy positions in his administration : State , Defence , NSC , CIA etc .What has emerged can safely be described as having NOT been Obama 's first choice line - up and has taken far longer than expected to emerge .These two aspects are NOT unrelated as the timing of the announcements and the individuals named have been impacted by a series of unforeseen incidents that could have long - term implications , and stretch well into Obama 's second term .In planning for his anticipated second - term , it is safe to conclude that Barack Obama anticipated naming Dr. Susan Rice as Hillary Clinton 's replacement as Secretary of State and to continue with David Petraeus as DCI .The fact that neither individual will be in their anticipated position come Inauguration Day owes much to the debacle in Benghazi , a calamity that will continue to dog Obama into 2013 .It will certainly be an issue for Hillary Clinton if she considers a run for the presidency in 2016 .Her role as Secretary of State at the time of the incident and subsequent incapacity , which has prevented her from testifying in the subject , will doubtless be open to scrutiny in 4 years time .Ironically , it appears certain that part of the reason for allocating this task to Ambassador Rice was an attempt to elevate her visibility and stature ahead of the nomination process in an anticipated second - term .If this was the case then it spectacularly backfired , casing senators to openly question her suitability for the role , and allowing other questions to be raised in relation to her political and personal qualities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.65421"}
