{"text": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) - Senators backing gun control are discussing ways to revise the defeated Senate background check bill to help win the votes they need to resuscitate the measure .Among the changes they might consider are limiting the fees buyers would pay at gun shows , adding provisions dealing with the mentally ill and altering language extending the background check requirement to all online sales , senators said Tuesday .Supporters fell five votes short when the Senate defeated legislation last month that would have extended required federal background checks to more buyers .That vote , four months after the massacre of 20 first - graders and six educators at a school in Newtown , Conn. , was a defeat for President Barack Obama and gun control advocates .Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev . , has promised to revisit the issue , perhaps by early summer .While Senate Democrats hunted more votes to expand background checks , the Republican - run House took a step in the opposite direction Wednesday , voting to make the system less restrictive for some veterans .The House Veterans Affairs Committee voted by voice to require a judge or magistrate to declare a veteran is dangerous before the name is entered in the background check system 's database of people barred from getting firearms .Currently , the Department of Veterans Affairs sends the system the names of veterans it has declared unable to manage their financial affairs - 127,000 names since 1998 .Supporters of the measure said veterans who ca n't handle their money are n't necessarily dangerous .The department opposes the measure , saying veterans in the database already have the ability to appeal .Gun rights advocates were also taking the offensive in the Senate .The chamber planned to vote Wednesday on a measure by Sen. Tom Coburn , R - Okla . , allowing firearms on land owned by the Army Corps of Engineers if it did n't conflict with state law .( Read the rest here . )This bill represented moderation and compromise , \" President Obama said after his gun registry bill went down to defeat yesterday .The President appeared angry at the press conference discussing the bill .He vowed , \" This effort is not over ... so long as the American people do n't give up \" on the effort .What this means in terms of real politics remains to be seen .The President used political blackmail against Democratic senators to force them to support the Affordable Health Care Act .He also lied to Democratic Congressmen , saying that he would support religious and conscience exemptions to the bill .He then signed and has stood by the HHS Mandate .I think this led to mistrust of the president in some quarters .I would guess that this played a part in why gun owners were \" upset \" about this bill and why they did not trust the president 's statements in support of it .There is a large segment of the population that believes the president absolutely .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.16712"}
