{"text": "LORI PETERSON , MINNEAPOLIS .I 'm not as convinced as Ms. Peterson is about Tim Dolan , although she has the right idea .As if that expense were n't enough , the Minneapolis City Council found even more extra money in the budget for the latest band - aid fix to the city 's entrenched crime problem : \" Minneapolis approves gunfire sensors \" .The Minneapolis City Council approved a new system that detects the sound of gunfire in the city , allowing police to respond more quickly to possible crimes .The system detects the acoustic signature of gunshots and even the sound of a bullet as it travels through the air .It uses 8 to 20 sensors per square mile to pinpoint gunfire to within 75 feet .\" If response time is predictably swift , then criminals have a much less friendly environment to operate in , and that deters a lot of people , \" says Minneapolis City Council Member Don Samuels , who represents the city 's North side .Samuels voted for the Shot Spotter technology in the council 's meeting Friday morning .The system would cost about $ 325,000 to be installed .Samuels says it is worth the price .I thought the general concensus is there were n't enough officers ?If that 's the case , how will there be a quicker response ?And how does this technology solve the problem of thugs streaming into Minneapolis for the myriad crime opportunities ?If the sensors ultimately result in an increase in arrests of criminals , but they 're turned back on the street by wishy - washy judges , how does that help the good citizens of Minneapolis and St. Paul ?Answer : It does n't .A lot of the crime problems can be boiled down to soft - headed liberalism and political correctness , which is why the problems are not going away any time soon .Throwing taxpayer 's money at the problem is not the answer ( but usually is the answer for Minneapolis leaders ) .A number of solutions have previously been posted and hashed over on this blog , but I 'm not confident the decision - makers are paying attention , so crime in Minneapolis will continue to be business as usual .Thanks for writing the article about the hurdles that the Police in Mpls . face .I met Sgt .Jindra at the 4th precinct and I am glad that there are still journalists in this town that will seek true expert opinion on the appalling crime issue .I wish there were more people in the news media that were willing to get to the bottom of what 's going on instead of accepting the Mayor / City Council 's reasoning that the existence of guns and not enough job opportunity are the problem .City officials are obviously covering their asses and not being candid or are truly clueless .Minneapolis has unfortunately become a prime place to be a career criminal and the bad guys know it .Derek ( McGruv ) ------ .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.99273"}

Maloney and Henry Hilow , the two attorneys representing the officers , declined to comment to Mother Jones about the officers ' participation in the investigation , saying it would be inappropriate to do so while the investigation was ongoing .\" It 's not only an ethical requirement but almost certainly a departmental imperative to do what they can to save the life of the suspect .The failure to do that is really disturbing . \"Whether Garmback could also potentially face criminal charges is a complex question , says Seth Stoughton , a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies policing .Stoughton says that he would expect prosecutors to at least consider the possibility , adding that both officers ' actions in the wake of the shooting also raise stark ethical questions : \" The Tamir Rice shooting was a use of horrible tactics , \" he says .\" It was a ludicrous way to approach a scene where you 've been told that there is a person with a gun who has been aiming it at bystanders .I would expect the officers would park at a safe distance and walk up , using cover and concealment , and try to initiate communication at a distance .That 's the ' three Cs ' of tactical response .\" It remains unclear why , in the minutes after both Rice and his sister lay on the ground , the officers did not tend to Rice .According to Stoughton - who previously served as a police officer himself for five years - a fundamental principle of policing is that once a threat has been eliminated and a scene secured , an officer 's first priority is to aid an injured person .\" At that point , the officer and his medical kit might be the only thing between the suspect and death , \" he says .\" It 's not only an ethical requirement but almost certainly a departmental imperative to do what they can to save the life of the suspect .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.80433"}

'In 2010 , eight people were killed by officers in the nation 's largest police department and 16 were wounded in police gunfire - another record low .The New York Police Department started keeping comparable data on firearms discharges in 1971 , when officers killed 93 people , chief NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said .There were 12 police shooting deaths in 2009 , and the previous low was nine in 2005 .Commissioner Raymond Kelly praised the officers ' training for reducing the number so greatly over the decades .\" It is a tribute to the police officers ' training and restraint as well as a reflection of a safer city that fatalities have plummeted despite an increase in police numbers and in the capacity of their firearms , \" Kelly said .The NYPD , which has more than 34,000 officers , has the lowest ratio of fatal , police - involved shootings of any major police department in the nation , officials said .One of the deaths occurred in October , when Emmanuel Paulino was shot by officers after a stun gun failed to subdue him .He was wielding a 6-inch knife after a fight with a girlfriend and refused to drop it , so officers fired a Taser stun gun , but one of the wired prongs meant to stick into his body did n't connect , police said .Officers shot him after he kept advancing , they said .Officers also shot and killed a man armed with a knife in December , and another fatal shooting occurred in June , when the department said a man started firing at officers during a search for guns and drugs .Among those wounded by police was a man trying to rob a hair salon where an off - duty officer was getting her hair done .She shot the gun out of his hand .Overall , NYPD officers are firing fewer times and the number of people killed by police bullets each year has hovered around a dozen during the past decade .The numbers are low even as it has become easier to shoot : Before 1993 , officers were armed with six - shot revolvers compared to today 's 16-shot semiautomatic pistols .The reason for fewer shootings is n't that there are fewer confrontations , it 's that the officers are being held more accountable , said Maria Haberfeld , a professor of police studies at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.98039"}

{"text": "A Problem in Madison .The department that I headed for over 20 years is coming under attack regarding the shooting of an unarmed intoxicated man last November .( For a news account CLICK HERE . )It will become a moral dilemma for a police department that has enjoyed a high level of community trust , respect and support for over 40 years .The investigation by the district attorney found that the officer involved was not criminally liable for the man 's death .Subsequently , the internal investigation by the police department found that the officer had not violated the department 's policy on the use of deadly force .The chief has tried to be forthcoming regarding press conferences and the release of the department 's internal investigation .Still , questions remain .In the 1989 U.S. Supreme Court Decision , Graham v. Connor , the standard for police use of force became \" objective reasonableness \" - translated : what counts is what was reasonably in the mind of the officer regarding a deadly threat , not what someone else thinks .For years , however , the department operated under a policy that highly cautioned the use of deadly force : .As in these and other situations in which state permitted police to do something , police leaders often chose a more restrictive use of police authority .In the 1970s , for example , we issued a policy regarding the use of deadly force that was more restrictive than what was permitted by Wisconsin law .At that time , Wisconsin , like many other states , permitted police to use deadly force against any \" fleeing felon .\" Our policy ( and thus our training ) instructed officers and required them to use deadly force only against those who , if not stopped , would present a clear and imminent life - threatening danger to others .Thus , auto thieves ( most of whom were juveniles ) and other thieves could no longer be apprehended by shooting them .Though state law permitted police to do so , we believed that it would be immoral for us do so .When I discussed what I was proposing with the community , they overwhelming supported my decision .Some of my officers did not .Nevertheless , my commitment to the community was that deadly force would be used only as a last resort by Madison police officers because we , as a department , believed in the sanctity of human life and the importance of using a lesser amount of force whenever possible .This harkens back to over 150 years ago during the time Sir Robert Peel in England .When he ( and others ) organized the new Metropolitan Police .Nine principles were promulgated as \" Peel 's Principles , \" two of which have to do with the use of force : .Police ability to secure public co - operation diminishes the need to use physical force .Police use physical force to enforce the law or restore order only when persuasion , advice and warning is insufficient .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.948395"}

{"text": "The data from Los Angeles County ( LAC ) reveals a somewhat comparable 24 percent decline .\" Until this research , \" Aveni says , \" performance has never been accurately matched to lighting conditions , \" even though as many as 77 percent of police shootings are believed to occur under some degree of diminished lighting .Some departments tally \" outdoor \" versus \" indoor \" shootings , but most appear not to precisely differentiate between low - light and ample - light events , despite the preponderance of shootings during nighttime duty tours .A multiple - officer shooting , in which more than one officer fires during a deadly force engagement , has an even greater influence on hit probability , Aveni discovered .According to the LAC data , when only one officer fired during an encounter , the average hit ratio was 51 percent .When an additional officer got involved in shooting , hits dropped dramatically , to 23 percent .With more than 2 officers shooting , the average hit ratio was only 9 percent - \" a whopping 82 percent declination , \" Aveni points out .Multiple - officer shootings , Aveni told Force Science News , are three times more likely to involve suspects with shoulder weapons than single - officer shootings .This tends to \" increase the typical stand - off distance , \" he says .Many of these confrontations also embody fast - changing , chaotic and complex circumstances .These factors , Aveni believes , help explain the negative impact on accuracy .Aveni also discovered a correlation between multiple - officer shootings and number of rounds fired .With LAC shootings involving only one officer , an average of 3.59 police rounds were fired .When 2 officers got involved , the average jumped to 4.98 rounds and with 3 officers or more to 6.48 .\" The number of rounds fired per officer increases in multiple - officer shootings by as much as 45 percent over single - officer shootings , \" Aveni says .Again , he judges distance to be a likely factor . \"A higher volume of fire may be used to compensate for the lower hit ratio as distance increases , \" he speculates .He believes the highly violent nature these events often present may be influential , too .\" Emotional contagion , \" where officers fire merely because others are shooting , is almost certainly an element of at least some multiple - officer shootings , Aveni concedes .But the extent of this assumed influence is difficult if not impossible to document .Certainly the claim , sometimes made after high - profile group shootings , \" that cops are firing their weapons empty in panic , is not supported by the facts , \" he stresses .The shooting of unarmed suspects is another phenomenon on which Aveni 's research sheds new light .After the restrictions imposed by Garner , \" you 'd expect fewer unarmed suspects to be shot , \" Aveni explains .Not necessarily true , though , Aveni found .In a recent 12-year period , Metro - Dade ( Miami ) PD reported 34 shootings in which suspects were \" clearly unarmed \" or in which officers thought they saw a gun but none was found .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.68965"}

District of Columbia .The court cited that the Act violated due process and equal protection rights of minors and Fifth Amendment rights of parents to make decisions for their minor children and to raise their children in a responsible manner .As the third objective of this initiative , the USAO conducted a public education campaign aimed at destroying the glamorous and powerful mystique of firearms and at changing the level of public acceptance of the presence of illegal firearms .The objective was to use a multi - media approach to influence District of Columbia residents , particularly young people .The USAO requested $ 250,000 for this campaign as part of the task force funding request .However , the EOUSA 's review committee did not fund this portion of the proposal .The Executive AUSA for Community Relations , who oversaw this public education campaign , stated that the United States Attorney made a commitment to this objective despite the review committee 's funding decision .As a result , resources for this objective were drawn from community donations and volunteer efforts .The USAO held Youth Anti - Violence Forums at four District of Columbia junior and senior high schools from February 1996 to March 1997 .The goal of each two - day forum was to reduce violence in the community by engaging youth , parents , teachers , and other community leaders in violence prevention training .The Attorney General , USAO representatives , MPD police officers , and television and radio personalities participated and made presentations .Each two - day program also offered a lecture on some of the realistic aspects of violence and drug involvement .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.285904"}

{"text": "Please feel free to leave a comment with your thoughts below ... .In the United States today , unemployment among those age 18 to age 34 is at epidemic levels and the number of young adults that are now living at home with Mom and Dad is at an all - time high .So why are so many of our young adults jobless ?Why are record numbers of them unable or unwilling to move out on their own ?Well , there are quite a few factors at work .Number one , our education system has completely and totally failed them .As I have written about previously , our education system is a joke and most high school graduates these days are simply not prepared to function at even a very basic level in our society .In addition , college education in the United States has become a giant money making scam that leaves scores of college graduates absolutely drowning in debt .Many young adults end up moving back in with Mom and Dad because they are drowning in so much debt that there are no other options .Thirdly , the number of good jobs continues to decline and this is hitting younger Americans the hardest .Millions of young people enter the workforce excited about the future only to find that there are hordes of applicants for the very limited number of decent jobs that are actually available .So all of this is creating an environment where more young adults are financially dependent on their parents that ever before in modern American history .Since the start of the recession , the percentage of young adults in America that are employed has dropped like a rock .In 2007 , the employment rate for Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 was 62.4 percent .Today , it is down to 54.3 percent .Yes , there are certainly many out there that are lazy , but the truth is that most of them would like to work if they could .It is just that it is much harder to find a job these days .And it is n't just young people that think that the job market has gotten tougher .According to one recent survey , 82 percent of all Americans believe that it is harder for young adults to find jobs today than it was for their parents to find jobs .But if they can not get jobs , then young adults can not financially support themselves .So more of them than ever are heading back home to live with Mom and Dad .In the year 2000 , 8.3 percent of all American women between the ages of 25 and 34 were living at home with their parents .Today , that figure is up to 9.7 percent .In the year 2000 , 12.9 percent of all American men between the ages of 25 and 34 were living at home with their parents .Today , that figure is up to an astounding 18.6 percent .Take a moment and let those statistics sink in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.30142"}

{"text": "When you look at Americans age 18 to age 24 , it is even worse .Among Americans age 18 to age 24 , 50 percent of all women and 59 percent of all men still live with their parents .Those are very frightening numbers .Part of this has to do with a fundamental cultural shift .An increasing number of parents these days expect that they will have to take care of their own children beyond the age of 22 .The following is from a recent article by Pew Research .... .When asked in a 1993 survey what age children should be financially independent from their parents , 80 % of parents said children have to be self - reliant by age 22 .In the current survey , only 67 % of parents say children have to be financially independent by age 22-a drop of 13 percentage points .But what accounts for the tremendous gender disparity that we see in the figures above ?Well , one major factor is that young women are now far more likely to pursue a college education than young men are .According to an article in the New York Times , women now account for approximately 57 percent of all enrollments at U.S. colleges and universities .The less education you have , the more likely you are to be unemployed in America today .So that is certainly a significant factor .But many that have gone on to college are also moving back home .When you are a young adult with no job and no prospects and you are swamped with tens of thousands of dollars of student loan debt , it can be incredibly difficult to be financially independent .After adjusting for inflation , U.S. college students are now borrowing about twice as much money as they did a decade ago .Many students that go on to graduate school end up with more than $ 100,000 in total student loan debt .It means that there are millions upon millions of angry , disillusioned and frustrated young adults out there today .A recent USA Today article told the story of 32-year - old Dennis Hansen .... .After a year without work , Hansen , 32 , was hired to monitor Lake Michigan and Lake Superior water for the state and federal governments over two summers .He also had short stints as a census worker and as an extra post office hand during one holiday crush .It has n't been enough : Hansen says he has a $ 13,000 credit card debt and that 's just for basics - his $ 600 monthly mortgage , heat and food .If the economy was humming along on all cylinders , it would be easy to blame our young adults for being too lazy .But these days most young adults have to scramble like crazy just to get a really low paying job .Large numbers of very talented young adults are waiting tables , flipping burgers or stocking shelves at Wal - Mart .And this reality is reflected in the overall economic statistics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "131.40118"}
