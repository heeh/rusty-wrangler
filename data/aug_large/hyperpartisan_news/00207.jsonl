{"text": "The Senate passed such a bill in May , but Republicans in charge of the House of Representatives declined to negotiate a compromise between it and their \" enforcement - only \" bill , approved by the House last December .Instead , they held dozens of public hearings across the country to rally support for their version , a bill that spurred protests by millions of Latinos and their supporters last spring .In the end , the Secure Fence Act , the portion of the House bill that Bush signed Thursday , was the only immigration reform expected to be enacted this year .Fencing of some kind already exists along 106 miles of border , mostly in short stretches around cities .The law requires two layers of new reinforced steel fencing along five segments of the 1,952-mile border , including the entire Arizona border and about 200 miles of the border in southern Texas .It also calls for additional infrastructure -- roads , vehicle barriers and additional Border Patrol checkpoints -- and electronic surveillance tools , including unmanned aerial vehicles , ground - based sensors , satellites , radar coverage and cameras .And it mandates a study of border security along the 4,000-mile Canadian border .A separate budget bill for the Department of Homeland Security that the president signed this month appropriated $ 1.2 billion for border fencing and barriers where practicable and \" other forms of tactical infrastructure and technology .\" The physical barriers that already exist along the border are being fortified by National Guard troops deployed to support the Border Patrol 's 12,000 agents .They are building and repairing roads , fences and vehicle barriers in the sectors of the border near San Diego ; Yuma and Tucson in Arizona ; and El Paso , Texas , Border Patrol spokesman Mike Friel said Thursday .The Department of Homeland Security also awarded a contract to Boeing Co. in September to construct a \" virtual fence \" along all 6,000 miles of the U.S. border , north and south .The project , known as the Secure Border Initiative Network , could run to $ 2.5 billion .Cost estimates for the 700 miles of fencing range from $ 2 billion to $ 7 billion .Supporters and opponents alike assert that the $ 1.2 billion allocated this month is inadequate .\" Even if it were all spent on the fence , it 's only enough to build 90 miles , so you 've got to start asking what is this about , anyway ? \" said Jeanne Butterfield , executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association in Washington , D.C. , which supports comprehensive reform .She called the border fence a politically motivated piece of symbolism and said it would not effectively deter illegal immigration .Leaders of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps , a volunteer border patrol militia that has staged its own fence construction effort on ranches near the border in Arizona this fall , have criticized the bill on their Web site as \" toothless . \"But U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter , R - Alpine ( San Diego County ) , a longtime fence supporter , applauded the signing , saying the fence will make border communities more secure . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.23579"}

Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee , said on Tuesday that he planned to ask Napolitano about the new ICE policies during Wednesday 's hearing .\" The Obama policies may be an impermissible intrusion on Congress 's plenary authority over immigration law , \" said Grassley , speaking at Judicial Watch .\" They 're pushing the envelope for sure and there 's little transparency in their actions . \"OBAMA QUIETLY PURSUING HIS BIT BY BIT BY BIT AMNESTY BY NON - ENFORCEMENT !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.48619"}
