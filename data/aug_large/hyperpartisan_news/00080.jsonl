{"text": "One of the most immediate challenges for a serious independent candidate would be to make sure his or her name showed up on the ballots in all 50 states , Georgetown University associate professor Hans Noel told ABC News .The states differ dramatically on the requirements to qualify to have a candidate 's name added to a ballot .The individual filing deadlines range mostly through the summer months , with Texas having the earliest deadline of May 9 , according to the site .Beyond that , the candidate in question would need to solicit thousands of signatures , indicating widespread appeal .\" If the barrier to an independent candidate were that they could n't mobilize enough people to get on the ballot in the 50 states , then that 's somebody that 's not going to win , \" Noel said .When it comes to campaign finances , the deadline is less of a factor .Christian Hilland , a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission , said candidates need to register with the agency within 15 days of spending at least $ 5,000 on campaign activity .The FEC allows for preliminary work and an exploratory committee to be formed , both of which could easily cost more than $ 5,000 , without having the candidate formally register .That grace period ends when the individual begins explicitly referring to him or herself as a candidate , Hilland said .Past Cases .Ross Perot and Ralph Nader may have been the most recent men to run as independent candidates , with the Reform and Green parties , respectively , but they were n't the most successful in terms of results , Noel says .\" The most successful independent candidate was Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and he had already been president ... and he still did n't win , \" Noel said .Democratic candidate then - Gov .Woodrow Wilson ended up winning with 41.8 percent of the vote , while Roosevelt got 27.4 percent as a member of the Progressive Party .William Howard Taft won 23.2 percent and socialist Eugene Debs got 6 percent of the vote .Noel explained that , essentially , Wilson held on to the majority of the Democrats , Roosevelt and Taft effectively split the Republicans , costing themselves the election .\" It 's reasonable to suggest that either had Roosevelt not run or Taft not run , either one of them might have beat Wilson , but because they were both in the race , neither won , \" Noel said .Noel said that it remains unclear with which party Bloomberg would align more closely , which makes sense given the media mogul 's political history .He was a registered Democrat until 2001 when he decided to run for New York City mayor as a Republican .Bloomberg , 73 , stayed with the GOP until 2007 when he became a registered independent before winning a third term .\" Whichever party he is closest to , his running helps the other candidate , \" Noel said .Looking at the Electoral Map .Beyond ballot access and political posturing , the biggest factor that will prove difficult is that Bloomberg would have to win -- not come in second , but win -- a sizeable number of states to seriously compete with the Democratic and Republican nominees .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.60568"}

'By that case , then , if Bernie won the Democratic nomination and Carly Fiorina won the Republican nomination , we should be supporting Carly Fiorina .\" Fiorina , of course , suspended her campaign for the Republican nomination shortly before Sanders ' HuffPost Live interview , meaning Clinton is the only remaining woman in the race .Sanders also praised the way millennials embrace feminism today , by speaking up when they experience inequity .She added that speaking up was n't so easy when she was younger , and she admires women who fought for equality during that less - inviting period for women .Her example , interestingly , was Gloria Steinem , who also found herself in hot water for comments about gender and the Democratic primary .Steinem has since apologized for saying that young women may support Sen. Sanders because \" the boys are with Bernie .\" Jane Sanders told HuffPost Live she valued the apology and chooses to judge Steinem on her life 's work rather than one remark .\" She apologized .I know that young people were offended by it , but it was a mistake , \" Sanders said .\" That 's what I do n't like about politics too much , that somebody makes a misstatement [ and it blows up].We know her life has been about equity for women and feminism .She made a mistake , she said so .I absolutely still respect her very much . \"Today , during the Upfronts , ABC was totally up front about a new political television series that 's about to hit the airwaves - one which will provide conclusive proof that Donald Trump has totally trumped the GOP .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.1181"}

Marco Rubio lagging far behind in third place .In New Hampshire , the race remains unchanged at the top , with Trump holding a commanding double - digit lead over his two closest - but - still - distant rivals Cruz and Rubio , who are locked in a tight battle for second place .Further down , Ohio Gov. John Kasich has edged past New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie into fourth place .Looking ahead to South Carolina , Trump continues to hold a double - digit lead over Cruz , his closest competitor in that state .In Politico , Katie Glueck reports that former Texas Gov. Rick Perry endorses Ted Cruz . \" Of those individuals who have a chance to win the Republican primary , at this juncture , from my perspective , Ted Cruz is by far the most consistent conservative in that crowd , \" Perry said . \"And that appears to be down to two people .\" Perry , who is famously skilled at retail politics , will campaign with Cruz Tuesday across Iowa , and will join Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King to stump for Cruz again Wednesday .Perry and King will both join Cruz at a Des Moines rally Wednesday night .The endorsement gives Cruz the blessing of the longest - serving governor in Texas history , just as the senator faces intensifying heat from other veteran politicians , including from his colleagues in Washington , Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole .In The New York Times , Patrick Healy writes about the campaign of Clinton and Sanders in Iowa .The race between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders , which voters will begin deciding a week from Monday , is not just about the White House anymore .It has intensified into an epochal battle over their vastly different visions for the Democratic Party .Mr. Sanders , a New Deal - style liberal from Vermont , last week became the party 's first top - tier candidate since the 1980s to propose broad - based tax increases .He argues that only muscular government action - Wall Street regulations , public works jobs , Medicare for all - will topple America 's \" rigged \" economy .\" Something is grotesquely wrong in America , \" he said Thursday in New Hampshire , urging voters to deliver a landslide in November that would cow Congress into enacting his agenda .Columbia University linguist John McWhorter wrote of language in The Atlantic this month , \" the serendipities of history chose one \" dialect \" as a standard and enshrined in on the page .\" When it comes specifically to the language of public policy , history has not been kind to us , imposing a style that is jargonistic , obtuse , and shot through with grandiose emptiness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.466675"}

W. Bush in 1988 .Never until the 1940s and after did a sitting Vice President ever get considered at all for the Presidency , other than if he succeeded the President by natural death or assassination .So we had Vice President John Nance Garner trying to win the 1940 Democratic Presidential nomination , but unfortunately for him , Franklin D. Roosevelt decided to seek a third term .In 1948 , former Vice President Henry Wallace in the third term of FDR tried for the Presidency as a third party candidate ( Progressive Party ) , fighting against fourth FDR term Vice President Harry Truman , who had succeeded FDR upon his death in 1945 .Alben Barkley , Vice President under Truman in his full term , tried to win the 1952 Democratic Presidential nomination , but his age was used against him , which may have been good , since Barkely died during the next term when he would have been President .Richard Nixon ran for President to succeed Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1960 , but lost in a close election to John F. Kennedy .Of course , Nixon won eight years later , being the first Vice President elected since Martin Van Buren in 1836 , but eight years after .Hubert H. Humphrey ran for President in 1968 to succeed Lyndon B. Johnson , but was defeated by Nixon , and tried for the nomination again in 1972 , but failed to be selected as the Presidential nominee .Walter Mondale ran for President in 1984 after he and Jimmy Carter were defeated in 1980 for a second term , but lost to Ronald Reagan .George H. W. Bush is the only exception to this reality , winning in 1988 after serving two terms as Vice President under Ronald Reagan .Dan Quayle tried for the Republican nomination in 1996 after serving one term under George H. W. Bush , but flopped badly .Dick Cheney had tried briefly for the Presidency in 1996 , but when he was Vice President under George W. Bush for two terms , his health was fragile and he chose not to try for the Presidency in 2008 .And now Joe Biden , after two terms as Vice President under Barack Obama , has reluctantly decided not to run for President in 2016 , due to the tragic death of his son Beau in May , and the grieving period preventing organization of a Presidential campaign .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.230774"}

{"text": "Articles , columns and blog posts .As I explained in an earlier post , Jane Kelsey 's anti - TPPA roadshow features a minor anti - trade activist called Lori Wallach , described most flatteringly by the NZ Herald as a \" leading expert \" .Wallach is a casebook study .I 'm late to this , but conservative commentator Matthew Hooton was leaked an email that shows Labour has fallen for the trick too .Hi All .The leading critic of TPPA , Jane Kelsey has offered to brief Labour Party staff at 4 pm today with Lori Wallach ( the American trade analyst / commentator ) before their Wellington public meeting .Grant Robertson who spoke for us at the Auckland public meeting found Lori quite useful and interesting , especially her analysis of the US Congress and political situation .I think this is a great opportunity for staff to hear from both experts and encourage you to attend .... .This is fairly alarming .Wallach is a fringe activist from the Nader - left in the US .There are plenty of serious trade critics in Washington , largely from within organised labour and the Democratic Party establishment , but Wallach is not one of them .As I wrote earlier , she may be an unheralded genius -- but , make no mistake , Wallach is decidedly , utterly , unheralded .The idea that Labour would take a steer from Lori Wallach on the TPPA should be troubling to anyone who cares about the state of that party .Wallach is simply not a credible voice outside of alternative media circles and the far - left flank of the US political spectrum .A related issue : Kelsey and Wallach oppose every trade deal out of principle .There is no conceivable version of the TPPA that either could support .To that extent , how useful is their counsel to a party that claims to support free trade in principle ?The answer , quite clearly , is not at all .When you call in Kelsey and Wallach for advice , you must know what form it will take .Just more evidence , if it were needed , that the protectionist elements of the former Alliance have staged what amounts to a silent coup within Labour on trade policy .In Bloomberg , Mark Niquette reports that Sanders singles out Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in his latest campaign ad .While the ad does n't mention Clinton by name , the Vermont senator has criticized her for the $ 675,000 she was paid for three speeches she gave to the firm in 2013 .It 's the latest effort by Sanders to tap voter anger about what he calls a \" rigged economy , \" with polls showing Sanders and Clinton in a close race in Monday 's Iowa caucuses .As the words \" Goldman Sachs \" appear on the screen , with the firm 's Jersey City office depicted , the ad mentions the firm 's agreement announced on Jan. 14 to settle a U.S. investigation into its handling of mortgage - backed securities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.39838"}
