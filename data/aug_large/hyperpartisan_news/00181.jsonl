{"text": "First example : .Addressing these economic development policy challenges is a crucial part of preparing for the future of work .A resilient , flexible economy must have a resilient , flexible workforce ; and vice versa .Workers will benefit under improved economic settings through the creation of new and better employment opportunities , the potential for fairer , more sustainable wages , and the development of higher value skills that are in demand internationally .A key benefit of a step change in economic development will be the social and economic gains that come from ongoing , meaningfulemployment .This is so far removed from how people actually communicate - so impossibly abstract - that it has n't a hope in hell of resonating with people who are not themselves engaged in public policy ( and , even then , it would be a hard slog ) .Or try this : .Different businesses and even different sectors respond to economic challenges and opportunities in different ways .As a small economy in a globalised world , it can be difficult for New Zealand to set the agenda .New Zealand businesses need to be well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities ... .Is there anyone across the world or political spectrum who could dispute the premise that \" different businesses and even different sectors respond to economic challenges and opportunities in different ways \" ?Not only is that true of New Zealand , but of every country at every point in human history .It simply does not need to be said .The kind of sophistry that turns people off politics .If you 're making a point that can not be challenged , that signals its weakness as an argument , not its strength .In government , there is a natural and often constructive tension between public servants and political staff .An effective Ministerial staffer pushes back against the tendency of bureaucrats to use dense , inaccessible language .Speeches are the clearest example of this .A public servant will draft a speech which will be dour , factual , jargon - filled and , above all else , safe .Depending on the stakes involved , political staff will often tear it to shreds , turning it from bureaucratese into language capable of connecting more forcefully to the public .( This is not to criticise public servants - it 's not for them to draft the kind of blunt , adversarial language that animates political language ) .When it has n't been copied and pasted from The Economist , Labour 's Future of Work papers read for all money like the work of public servants- odd , since Labour is in opposition and only has political staff .One possible explanation is that the Future of Work 's lead MP is Grant Robertson , who was a diplomat in his previous career .And I have written before that risk - aversion is Robertson 's Achilles ' Heel - and perhaps this is why the taskforce produces material like this .But I suspect the problem runs deeper .More and more , Labour thinks , acts and communicates less like a political party than some hybrid government department / NGO , having lost along the way the knack of talking to voters in language likely to resonate , let alone persuade .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.034195"}

Obama could not have had a better opponent than Hillary Clinton .Nor could he have had a better opponent to prepare him for the battle royal to come against John McCain and the Republicans ahead of the November elections .Hillary Clinton was like a big Mama cat determined to teach her kitten how to hunt , and hang with the big dogs for the fights ahead .And how about Bill Clinton , Chelsea , and th whole Clinton team .They were magnificent .They really showed their metal .BRAVO !TEAM CLINTON ...BRAVO !And how about YOU ! my fellow Americans .I 'm so proud of you .And proud to be one of you .You showed what you are made of .And what makes America so great .You never gave up on your Champion Hillary Clinton .Time , and time again you eagerly waited your turn to vote for Hillary Clinton .To pick her up and pass her along down the line to the rest of your fellow Americans .You never gave up on her .Just as Hillary Clinton never gave up on you .No matter how many times they counted her out .No matter how many times they brutally knocked her down .You knew she would get back up .And you were ready to support her when she did .AMERICA LOVESA FIGHTER .AMERICA UNDERSTANDS A FIGHTER .AMERICA IS A FIGHTER .I'MPROUD OF YOU AMERICA !Hillary said she would accept the VP spot on the ticket if ask .And I am thrilled to hear that .I think it would be crazy not to take her up on that offer .You could not have a better VP than Hillary Clinton .Hillary Clinton is Sen. Obama 's best chance of winning the Whitehouse in November .And it is essential that the democrats take back the Whitehouse .The American people are in a very desperate condition now .George Bush has wrecked America , and much of the world . jacksmith ...Working Class :-) .p.s .I really liked Sen. Barack Obama 's speech in Minnesota .I think he just maybe ready now for the Bush Republican attack machine , dirty tricks , and vote fraud machine .It 's time to let Obama choose his own running mate , perhaps Edwards , Richardson or someone else who likes him and shares his values .Selecting Hillary Clinton would backfire badly , in my view .Many remain suspicious of her sudden leap into populism , in the face of her many financial ties to those who profit from war and poverty .As candidate and vice - president , too , it is hard to believe that she would not undermine Obama with all her force -- as she has done consistently .Had Edwards or one of the other candidates made she attacks she has done or refused to retire in dignity , no one would have given them the public praise heaped on her as \" strong \" , that is , egotistic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.146194"}
