{"text": "Texas , \" said Shannon Edmonds , state lobbyist for the Texas District and County Attorneys Association .Last year , .South Carolina adopted the death penalty for the second offense of raping a child under age 11 .Oklahoma followed , passing Jessica 's Law with a death penalty provision for raping a child under age 14 .Texas already had some of the toughest child predator laws on the books with its two - strikes rule that sends child predators to jail for life .But the push for even harsher punishment was coming from the state leadership , rather than from the grass roots , as tightening of criminal laws often does .\" Prosecutors will tell you these are the most difficult cases to get a guilty verdict on , \" .Edmonds said .\" Prosecutors lose more of these cases than any other .The Texas Association Against Sexual Assault also voiced its concerns about \" unintended consequences \" of Jessica 's Laws .The mandatory sentences can backfire , said TAASA spokeswoman Karen Amacher , as prosecutors lose the flexibility to seek lesser sentences in cases where a jury trial may prove too taxing for a child witness , or a jury or judge may not feel a 25-year sentence is warranted .Since an estimated 80 % of child sexual assaults are committed by family members , groups like Amacher 's are concerned that mandatory sentence laws , not to mention the death penalty , might dissuade certain people from reporting abuse to authorities . \"With sex offenders we want to say let 's lock them up and throw away the key - these folks are just awful , after all - but it 's just not realistic , \" Amacher said .Even avowed supporters of the death penalty in murder cases think the .Texas proposal would be a bad idea .Legal scholars from both sides of the political spectrum have warned .Texas legislators the death penalty for repeat sex offenders would likely be declared unconstitutional .In 1977 the Supreme Court ruled in Coker vs. .Georgia that the death penalty in rape cases was cruel and unusual punishment .Nevertheless , several states have retained old laws providing the death penalty for rape of minors - including .Florida , .Montana and .Louisiana .Only one state , .Louisiana , currently has someone on death row charged with raping a child : Patrick O. Kennedy , who faces the death penalty after being convicted in 2003 of raping an eight - year - old .His case is being appealed and could make its way to the Supreme Court , according to Richard Dieter , head of the Death Penalty Information Center .Even so , prosecutors are n't willing to sit and wait for the highest court in the land to sort it all out .Instead , district attorneys around the state told the legislature that what they really needed were more tools to win cases , not limits on their choices .Working in committee , prosecutors and victims ' rights groups managed to include evidence rule changes that would give them more flexibility in presenting child witnesses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.518303"}
{"text": "It does n't seem like a difficult choice .Who would n't want to support laws targeting convicted sex offenders and be paid for it ?Yet legislatures from Arizona to Illinois to Rhode Island are leaning against implementing the law .Because once you get past the painful emotions and look hard at the problem of child sexual abuse , it turns out that sex offender registration and community notification laws might not actually prevent sexual violence .Sex offender laws are based on two popular myths about child abuse : that children have most to fear from strangers , and that sex offenders will repeat their crimes .In fact , more than 90 percent of child sexual abuse is committed by someone the child knows .And authoritative studies show that three out of four sex offenders do not reoffend within 15 years of release from prison .In fact , 87 percent of sex crimes are committed by people with no previous sex offense convictions .The Adam Walsh Act does n't tackle the real dangers to children , and contains disturbing provisions .It requires states to register and identify online children age 14 and older who commit sex offenses .Many states treat child sex offenders differently than adults , exempting them from community notification .They understand that child sex offenders respond well to treatment and have an excellent chance of rehabilitation -- and that crimes they committed as children should not haunt the rest of their lives .Thus the Illinois legislature , knowing it was acting in conflict with the Adam Walsh Act , recently overrode the governor 's veto of a law exempting child offenders from online registration .In the past , federal law required only that states register sexually violent offenders for 15 years .The new act requires states to register virtually anyone convicted of a sex offense .This would force some states to significantly expand their registries .The Adam Walsh Act also extends from 15 years to 25 years or life the time someone is on a registry and subject to community notification , without the possibility of petitioning to be removed .Implementing the changes required by the act will cost states a lot of money .And there are other costs to implementing the act .Subjecting convicted sex offenders to community notification for the rest of their lives may do great harm -- both to the individuals and to community safety .Offenders included on online sex offender registries endure shattered privacy , social ostracism , diminished employment and housing opportunities , harassment and even vigilante violence .Their families suffer as well .Unnecessarily expansive community notification laws may drive more offenders underground , away from supportive services like treatment , and away from the supervision and monitoring of law enforcement .Harsh enduring consequences also provide little incentive for former offenders to live without re - offending : as one registrant told Human Rights Watch , \" No one believes I can change , so why even try ?\" Every child has the right to live free from violence and sexual abuse .Promoting public safety by holding offenders accountable and by instituting effective crime prevention measures is a core governmental obligation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.78408"}
