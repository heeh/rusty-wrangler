' called \" Murder For Infinity \" .( That has a real Quinn Martin ring to it , do n't you think ? )The detectives are tossing a scuzzy room in a Seventh Street flop - house trying to find clues that will lead them to their suspect in a murder investigation .Detective Johnny Corso brings in this guy , another \" resident \" by the name of \" Marco \" who is less than forthcoming with any information about the suspect - that is , until Mike Haines tells Corso to check him out .Fearful that the cops might search his pad , \" Marco \" describes the guy who was with the suspect .Marco \" was played by Sam Waterston , and the reason I put his name in quotation marks is because I want to make the argument that he was actually Jack McCoy , the character Waterston played on ' Law & Order ' for sixteen years .Jack McCoy grew up in Chicago , the son of an abusive , bigoted cop who would beat him and his mother for failing in his eyes .( The father would later die of cancer . )One reason why he may have gone to NYU 's School of Law was to put distance between him and his father .( I 'm not saying he went directly to work for the D.A. 's office upon graduating , but it does take three years to complete law school in the United States . )And that flophouse down on 7th Street would be walking distance to the school .Maybe it was a dump , but Jack probably did n't have access to much money at the time .Even later in life , when he was making a very nice living as the Executive ADA for New York City , he was appreciative of a bargain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.79939"}

'He promised us that anyone who died in the war would be a martyr and go instantly to paradise . 'He laughs . 'I know how it sounds now but at the time , whenever a mullah came to talk to us about the war at school , I was burning to join up . 'The regime used aggressive recruiting techniques , particularly in mosques and schools in lower income urban and rural areas where passionate talk of religious sacrifice and martyrdom fired up the populace .Iranian television broadcast pictures of young men - boys - with their red Basij headbands and guns , saying how wonderful it was to be a soldier for Islam , to fight for freedom and your country .There were films of women saying how proud they were that their sons had died martyrs for the cause .The Basiji orders were founded to absorb young men who were not old enough to join the regular military .Although Hassan was 16 when he joined up , he says there were plenty of much younger boys . 'There was a kid who was 12 , ' he says . 'He lied about his age but they let him join anyway .He said he had his parents ' permission but I ca n't imagine any mother would willingly let their child go to war like that .

{"text": "There is a sense of resentment from the general public who tend to exaggerate the benefits , but nonetheless this signifies a change in attitude to the war and those who fought or died in it .Duel , a film made by Ahmadreza Darvish and released last year was remarkable for two things : it was the most expensive film ever made in Iran and , unlike the multitude of earlier war films , it made no attempt to glorify martyrdom and sacrifice .In fact it made a pretty good case for the futility of war .Hassan went to the front in 1981 .An Iraqi officer once described the effect this had on his men : ' They come on in their hundreds , often walking straight across the minefields , triggering them with their feet as they are supposed to . 'He said that his men would cry and try to run away from these men - most of them very young : ' my officers had to kick them back to their guns . 'The Basiji had a piece of white cloth pinned to their uniforms as a symbol of a shroud , and wore a plastic key around their necks , issued as a symbol of their assured entry to paradise .At first they had little or no training and were used mostly as human minesweepers , but as the war raged on , they became more sophisticated in their training and preparation .In July 1982 Iran launched Operation Ramadan on Iraqi territory , near Basra .Although Basra was within range of Iranian artillery , the clergy - who had taken charge of operations earlier that year - used ' human - wave ' attacks by the Pasdaran and Basij against the city in one of the biggest land battles since 1945 .Ranging in age from only nine to more than 50 , these eager soldiers swept over minefields and fortifications to clear safe paths for the tanks .Unsurprisingly , the Iranians sustained an immense number of casualties , and it is from this battle that Hassan has his limp .Despite what were horrific injuries , he went back a few years later , towards the end of the war .I ask him why and he hesitates . 'It 's hard to explain if you were n't there , ' he says , looking into the distance . 'But it was hard to get back to normal life .People in Tehran were scared of the bombing and my family wanted to go north to be safe .I just kept thinking of my friends and wandering what was happening . 'He looks embarrassed and clears his throat . 'You know , I felt close to God there .
