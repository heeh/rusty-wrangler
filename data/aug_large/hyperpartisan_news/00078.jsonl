County 's Department of Social Services .Nationwide , Americans pay around $ 22 billion annually to provide illegal immigrants with welfare perks that include food assistance programs such as free school lunches in public schools , food stamps and a nutritional program ( known as WIC ) for low - income women and their children .Surprise , surprise ; Census Bureau data reveals that most U.S. families headed by illegal immigrants use taxpayer - funded welfare programs on behalf of their American - born anchor babies .Even before the recession , immigrant households with children used welfare programs at consistently higher rates than natives , according to the extensive census data collected and analyzed by a nonpartisan Washington D.C. group dedicated to researching legal and illegal immigration in the U.S.The results , published this month in a lengthy report , are hardly surprising .Basically , the majority of households across the country benefitting from publicly - funded welfare programs are headed by immigrants , both legal and illegal .States where immigrant households with children have the highest welfare use rates are Arizona ( 62 % ) , Texas , California and New York with 61 % each and Pennsylvania(59 % ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.50216"}

{"text": "A response from Archbishop Dolan to the comments on this page would be greatly appreciated by all , I 'm sure .I understand he is busier than I can possibly imagine , but please do n't give us such an inflammatory and divisive statement and not respond to our honest and sincere comments on it .Thank you .Thank you Archbishop Dolan for your response to Arizona 's discriminatory and mean - spirited law .I work for Catholic Charities assisting immigrants with legal process in obtaining lawful status .As the Catholic church and those of us in the legal immigration community have long recognized , our nation 's immgration laws are broken .The law draws arbitrary distinctions regarding \" legal \" and \" illegal \" status .Although many parts of the United States government allows \" illegal \" or undocumented immigrants to pay taxes , attend schools , contribute to our society in many ways , the civil laws refuse to recognize these immigrants by granting them legal status .Not only is the Arizona law unconstitutional and un - American as Archbishop Dolan correctly points out , it also dedicates huge sums of tax payer money to finding and detaining people who are not criminals ( residing in the United States illegally is a civil violation not a crime ) .This law will break up families , divert police resources from investigating and capturing actual criminals , and will ultimately do nothing to resolve the serious crisis our country faces with immigration laws .I applaud Archbishop Dolan for recognizing the true nature of this law and the human rights violations that it will engender .Thank you for speaking out for the least of those among us and giving a voice to the many Catholic immigrants whom this law will negatively affect .I have such high regard for you .On this question , there is one thought that continually comes to my mind .This is where reform MUST start ! !I am in entire agreement with Archbishop Dolan 's statement on the Arizona law .At a minimum , it constitutes an infringement of the federal government 's authority to regulate immigration which is derived from broad powers believed to inhere in nation states ( and not their political subdivisions ) by virtue of general international law .More importantly , the law also constitutes an effort to resolve the immigration controversy by means of the politics of attrition .Its potential for discrimination and abuse is manifest , as many commentators have pointed out .We should recognize that many individuals who have come here in undocumented fashion have done so because their own states were unable to maintain their social rights at a minimally acceptable level .Archbishop Dolan 's statement appropriately reflects the humanitarian and pastoral concerns which should be extended to these immigrants , rather than the condemnation which they have received under the Arizona statute .It should also be recognized that our current immigration laws really provide no avenue for these undocumented workers ( who perform labor which is neither skilled nor professional ) to come here legally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.00213"}
