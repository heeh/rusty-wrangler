{"text": "In most of these cases , police have defended the use of force , arguing the killer officers ' safety was put in danger during some kind of altercation , the nature of which has been disputed by witnesses each time .If the grand jury indicts Darren Wilson for killing Michael Brown , a similar defense will certainly be heard in the courtroom .The grand jury proceedings in the Brown case could take weeks , perhaps months .Prosecutors are currently investigating the death of Kajieme Powell .In the meantime , Ferguson and the broader St. Louis area will continue to be a hotbed of organizing and activism .The late night clashes that stunned the public may be over , but peaceful marches continue on a daily basis .Last Tuesday , two St. Louis police officers shot and killed 25-year - old Kajieme Powell just a few miles away from the ongoing protests sparked by the police killing of another young black man , Michael Brown of Ferguson , Missouri .A video shot by an eyewitness and released last week by the St. Louis police shows Powell approaching the officers after allegedly stealing snacks from a store - before being shot about a dozen times .The video contradicts the police 's initial story about the incident .Witnesses called the shooting excessive and wondered why police did n't shoot Powell in the foot or use a Taser instead of mowing him down with a fatal barrage of bullets .St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson , however , said the officers followed proper protocol .By early evening , groups of protesters were already holding signs about Powell and Brown and marching on Ferguson 's West Florissant Avenue , where protests have occurred daily since Brown 's death on August 9 .The protesters were peaceful , but I watched the police arrest a woman as soon as I arrived .As free speech advocates with the National Lawyers Guild scrambled to learn the woman 's identity , police could be seen arresting another individual who had been marching in a crowd across the street .Both arrests were presumably made because the protesters left the sidewalk and entered the street .Perhaps they had chanted protest slogans toward police .A protester would later warn me to stay on the sidewalk and watch out for the police \" snatch squads . \" Led by a few local ministers , a march took form from the informal groups of sign - wielding protesters and began a long procession - on the sidewalks , of course .About 200 people joined the march , which continued for about two miles before reaching the 24-hour vigil and protest across the street from the main Ferguson police station .Cars continuously honked their horns as we marched , and children gathered on front lawns to join in the chanting , holding signs reading , \" hands up , do n't shoot ! \"Vanessa Lucas and Rona Cadwell came to Ferguson from East St. Louis on the week of August 22 , 2014 to \" help the cause . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.22446"}
{"text": "County Police Chief Jon Belmar said his officers have responded with \" an incredible amount of restraint \" as they 've had rocks and bottles thrown at them , been shot at and had two dozen patrol vehicles destroyed .The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown , citing threats against that officer and others .The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer , but the Ferguson police chief said later that the name was incorrect .Like last year 's Trayvon Martin shooting , social media brought international attention to a tragedy that might otherwise have been known only to the immediate community .Ferguson spawned a proliferation of hashtags and was the dominant subject Thursday on Twitter , Facebook and other sites .Journalists and protesters offered real - time pictures , videos and text reports , and the world responded , often in outrage .Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street .They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car , then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer 's weapon .At least one shot was fired inside the car .The struggle then spilled onto the street , where Brown was shot multiple times .The officer involved was injured , with one side of his face swollen , Jackson said .Dorian Johnson , who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened , has told a much different story .He has told reporters that the officer ordered them out of the street , then grabbed his friend 's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing .He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him , firing multiple times .Attorney General Eric Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed eyewitnesses to the shooting .A person familiar with the matter , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing , said federal authorities have interviewed Johnson .Holder spoke by telephone Thursday with Brown 's family to offer condolences and to tell them that the Justice Department was committed to a full and independent investigation .Associated Press writers Alan Scher Zagier and Jim Suhr in Ferguson , Eric Tucker in Washington and Hillel Italie in New York , and AP researcher Rhonda Shafner , also in New York , contributed to this report .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.35009"}
