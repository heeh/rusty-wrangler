While playing in the pool with his aunt , he noticed one of his toys fell in the pool drain and when he tried to get it out , his arm got stuck .Although Usher V was rescued and recovered from his injuries , his mother Tameka Raymond initiated a request for temporary emergency custody , saying Usher was leaving their sons in the care of others , which made her uncomfortable .Unfortunately for Foster , the judge denied her request and allowed Usher to continue to have primary custody of their children .But if you thought Tameka Foster losing the custody hearing against Usher would shut her down , think again !According to Hip Hop Enquirer , Foster revamped her legal team and showed up to court again to gain custody of Usher V and Naviyd , the two children she had with Usher .As Tameka was ready to fight for her motherly rights , Usher was nowhere to be found in court .Since Usher was a no - show , the Judge requested Tameka , her lawyers , and Usher 's legal team have a meeting in chambers .The meeting in chambers concluded with rescheduling a hearing for sometime in October , at which time Usher is expected to show face .We 'll be watching to see if he does .It was exactly one week ago when we first reported that R&B singer Usher Raymond 's son , Usher Raymond V ( Cinco ) was involved in a terrible pool accident at the singer 's home .5-year - old Raymond nearly almost drowned after his arm got stuck in a pool drain after he dove into the pool , hoping to recover a toy that he saw in the drain .Both his aunt and the housekeeper jumped into the pool in an effort to save him , but unfortunately , they were unsuccessful .Thankfully he was rescued by one of the men who worked in his home , but the incident was so traumatic , he spent days in the intensive care unit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.86335"}
