{"text": "We found that men who reported spending more time in childcare also had the lowest testosterone levels in 2009 , which provided additional support for this hypothesis .There were other nuances to our findings , some of which we were surprised to see .For instance , although all fathers as a group had comparatively greater drops in their testosterone across the 5 years of the study , the hormonal drop was much larger among men who had newborn babies .In these men , testosterone levels were about half their former pre - fatherhood levels measured in 2005 .When we looked at men whose youngest child was older than 1 month , we found that their testosterone drop was less than in this group of men with newborns .These findings generated a great deal of media and scientific attention .They are the first demonstration in humans that fatherhood seems to drive down a man 's testosterone , rather than the other way around .Our data suggest that the drop in testosterone may be especially dramatic soon after birth but then rebounds partially afterwards .They also suggest that the extent to which a father 's testosterone drops or stays relatively low is somehow linked with his commitment to caring for offspring .While these findings helped answer certain questions , they also led to new ones .What is the cause of the decline in testosterone ?What are the likely effects on a man 's behavior or health ?As is often the case with new findings such as ours , we do not have definitive answers to many of these questions .However , we will do our best to address a few of the implications of these findings below .Why should fathers have lower testosterone ?Does this \" make sense \" ?There has traditionally been a great deal of debate about the effects that testosterone has on human behavior .In general , we can think of the hormone as providing a bit of a competitive and confidence boost .Classically , the hormone has been seen as motivating behaviors that help males compete for and attract mates .In our study , we found that the men who entered relationships and became fathers during the 5 years of the study had higher testosterone to begin with .Although we did not investigate what behaviors or other characteristics might explain the tendency of higher testosterone males to find mates , this finding is broadly consistent with our basic understanding of the role of the hormone in many species .Some of the effects that are encouraged by testosterone focus one 's attentions and energies on the social realm .Just as these behaviors could improve the likelihood of a young man finding a mate and becoming a father , they might then become a detriment when duties shift to caring for dependents .For instance , it is known that men with higher testosterone are moderately more likely to express aggressive behaviors .Higher testosterone men are also more likely to be \" sensation seekers \" and to engage in risky behaviors , such as drug or alcohol abuse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.87476"}
{"text": "Researchers at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor surveyed over 100 couples who recently became parents .They asked the men and women to detail their sexuality following the birth of their new child , and they found that both moms and dads reported a postpartum decline in their sexual desire and activity .The researchers found that most common cause behind the dip in sexuality was not a lack of female desire or a resistance on her part , but rather a lack of energy for both partners .The moms and dads in the study both said that fatigue and stress kept them from wanting to have sex , and that their desire took a dip along with their energy following childbirth .In other words , becoming a parent is n't just hard on new moms and female sexuality .Dads are equally impacted by this huge life change .In fact , studies have shown that dads actually undergo hormonal changes along with their partners .New dads often experience a decrease in testosterone , which is a hormone that is linked to libido as well as behaviors such as aggression and dominance .Researchers believe that lower testosterone levels might have made sense from an evolutionary perspective because they helped to ensure that fathers would be more committed and available to their partner and new baby .Since women are unable to have sex right after childbirth and require plenty of assistance , lower levels of testosterone might have helped men to rein in their libido and to be more hands - on and nurturing to their partners during this vulnerable time .Studies have also shown that new dads have an increase in oxytocin ( the bonding hormone ) which could help them to feel more intimate and bonded with their mates and their child .Studies such as these are important because they help to highlight how couples impact one another 's sexual desires and how parenthood can cause our sexuality to change and evolve .It 's a good idea to keep findings like these in mind when trying to get your sex life back on track after having kids .Realizing that it is n't your \" fault \" and that a decrease in sexuality is normal and even beneficial from an evolutionary standpoint can help you to feel more confident as you start initiating sex once again .That 's why it is so crucial to tune into one another and to communicate about your desires and even your fears .Troubleshoot ways to find more time and energy for sex , and prioritize your relationship along with your new parenting responsibilities .A strong , healthy marriage is one of the best gifts you can give your baby , so do n't feel selfish for putting your relationship first and for spending time alone as a couple .It is possible to have an amazing sex life and be a parent ...but you have to work with your partner to make it happen .Thanks for signing up !Oops !ABOUT THE AUTHOR .Laura Berman , PhD .Laura Berman , PhD , is a leading sex and relationship educator and therapist , popular TV and radio host , New York Times best - selling author , and assistant clinical professor of ob - gyn and psychiatry at the ... read more Search form .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.95552"}

{"text": "Based on cross - species data , it is widely assumed that the hormone testosterone ( T ) plays a primary role in mediating such shifts in reproductive strategy between mating and parenting .There is growing evidence that this model may apply to human males .For example , men with elevated T show greater skeletal muscle mass [ 14 ] , particularly if they are physically active [ 15 ] , which may reflect energetic investments in mating effort [ 5 ] , [ 16 ] .Moreover , elevated T predicts heightened risk - taking [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] and greater likelihood to engage in health - compromising display behaviors [ 24 ] as well as drug and alcohol abuse [ 25 ] .Men with higher T have also been found to have a greater number of lifetime sexual partners [ 26 ] .Recently , low sensation seeking fathers were also shown to have reduced T relative to high sensation seeking fathers [ 29 ] .Fathers with lower baseline T have also been found to engage in more hands - on caregiving behaviors in observed parent - child interactions [ 30 ] .Collectively these findings suggest that elevated T likely facilitates somatic growth and behavioral priorities that enhance men 's mating effort but may also reduce resources fathers have available for parental investment and diminish their sensitivity to offspring needs .Taken together these results suggest that direct interaction with children may be an important cause of the lower T often observed among fathers .One important way that fathers may interact with their offspring is through cosleeping [ 12 ] , [ 39 ] , which involves close proximity with their offspring during sleep .To date , little work has evaluated the effects of cosleeping on human male physiology or behavior .Specifically , cosleeping is an umbrella term that defines any sleeping arrangement in which a child and his / her caregiver sleep in close enough proximity to engage in and communicate through sensory exchanges [ 40 ] .However , much less is generally known about the role and placement of the father in cosleeping arrangements cross - culturally [ 45 ] .Though available data are limited , preliminary observations also suggest that this pattern of fathers being present with mothers and children during sleep may also be common in cultures where cosleeping is more widely practiced [ 47 ] - [ 49 ] .Research on the physiological and behavioral implications of familial sleeping arrangements has focused almost entirely on mother - infant cosleeping , particularly as it contributes to promotion of breastfeeding .Although variation in sleep quality can influence men 's health [ 50 ] and physiology [ 51 ] as well as mental well - being for fathers of young children [ 52 ] , comparatively little is known about the impacts of different familial sleep arrangements on paternal behavior and biology .In two existing studies of familial sleep behavior , bedsharing fathers showed less synchrony with their infants ' arousals , compared to mothers , and generally slept beyond arm 's reach of their infants [ 45 ] , [ 53 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.96674"}
{"text": "Based upon the finding , we think it unlikely that low testosterone before men were fathers led to more childcare .Instead our best guess is that childcare , or some behavior or activity that is associated with childcare , somehow lowered the testosterone levels of highly - involved fathers in our sample .It is important to note that several recent experimental studies ( here and here ) , including our own , have failed to find that testosterone drops immediately in fathers after they interact with their children .For instance , in a recent study of 42 fathers in our study , we looked at hormone levels before and 30 and 60 minutes after they interacted with their offspring .Testosterone levels were stable across this period .This could indicate that interacting with a child does not lead to a drop in testosterone .However it could also indicate that we did not measure men over a long enough period of interaction to see a biological response .For instance , a father 's body might only \" reset \" hormone levels in response to more extended periods of interaction , such as over weeks or months .That is , was the intensity and number of hours spent in childcare influenced by the drop in testosterone experienced by new fathers , rather than vice versa ?Addressing these various possibilities will require new studies with more fine - grained data on testosterone and paternal care as fathers engage with their newborn babies in the weeks and months after birth .We look forward to seeing what future studies reveal !What are the possible effects of the testosterone drop on a man 's behavior and health ?Fathers who learned of our findings expressed a range of emotions , from excitement to fascination to concern .If testosterone declines with the onset of fatherhood , what effects on behavior or health might this have ?Here we briefly review the evidence linking testosterone with several of the traits that men seemed to express most concern about , in hopes of dispelling some of the concerns that were raised .First , as we noted above , the largest drops in testosterone were seen in fathers whose partners had only recently given birth to newborns .Although fathers ' testosterone declined more than non - fathers regardless of child age , evening testosterone declined a median of 49 % in fathers of newborns compared to 34 % in other new fathers .Thus , the first point to keep in mind about our study 's findings is that the biggest drop in testosterone appeared to be temporary , and to rebound somewhat about a month after birth .Second , although testosterone is an important male reproductive hormone , many reproductive functions are maintained at quite low levels of the hormone .Common sense and every day experience tell us that fathers must maintain the ability to have additional children , even if their testosterone decreases , because many men have large families with multiple offspring .Indeed , of the 162 men in our study who transitioned to fatherhood between ages 21 and 26 , roughly 27 % had two or more children during that period .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.174076"}

{"text": "While these findings helped answer certain questions , they also led to new ones .What is the cause of the decline in testosterone ?What are the likely effects on a man 's behavior or health ?As is often the case with new findings such as ours , we do not have definitive answers to many of these questions .However , we will do our best to address a few of the implications of these findings below .Why should fathers have lower testosterone ?Does this \" make sense \" ?There has traditionally been a great deal of debate about the effects that testosterone has on human behavior .In general , we can think of the hormone as providing a bit of a competitive and confidence boost .Classically , the hormone has been seen as motivating behaviors that help males compete for and attract mates .In our study , we found that the men who entered relationships and became fathers during the 5 years of the study had higher testosterone to begin with .Although we did not investigate what behaviors or other characteristics might explain the tendency of higher testosterone males to find mates , this finding is broadly consistent with our basic understanding of the role of the hormone in many species .Some of the effects that are encouraged by testosterone focus one 's attentions and energies on the social realm .Just as these behaviors could improve the likelihood of a young man finding a mate and becoming a father , they might then become a detriment when duties shift to caring for dependents .For instance , it is known that men with higher testosterone are moderately more likely to express aggressive behaviors .Higher testosterone men are also more likely to be \" sensation seekers \" and to engage in risky behaviors , such as drug or alcohol abuse .In addition , prior research shows that men with higher testosterone are more likely to be promiscuous , and indeed , have been shown to have a greater number of lifetime sexual partners .Personality differences between men , and cultural variation in social norms , can modify the relationships between hormones and behaviors like these .But the general assumption among many anthropologists who study the role of hormones in human fatherhood is that these behaviors represent time investments that would likely detract from a man 's ability to be an effective and attentive father and caregiver .Although there are very few available studies that have evaluated the effects of testosterone on fathering behaviors , there is preliminary evidence that lower testosterone can sensitize men to being more involved as caregivers .As we noted above , in our study we found that fathers who reported being involved in childcare had the lowest levels of evening testosterone .Perhaps more compelling evidence is reported by a study which showed that fathers with lower testosterone expressed greater sympathy towards , and a need to respond to , infant cries .Similarly , a recent study , released just this week , found that men 's testosterone decreased when they heard recorded infant cries , but only if they felt a need to nurture the upset infant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.284275"}

Gettler published a study finding that sparked countless sensational headlines .Examining the testosterone levels of Filipino men across a five - year period revealed a drop in the stereotypical He - Man hormone after a particular shared milestone : fatherhood .Although separate studies had identified a testosterone - fatherhood correlation in other species , this was the first to document longitudinally the hormone drop in human dads [ source : Gettler et al ] .Compared to the men who remained single throughout the study term , those who got hitched and had babies had much less testosterone in their saliva [ source : Gettler et al ] .Not only that , the men who went on to become fathers often had higher than average amounts of testosterone at the start of the study , when they were single .So what gives ?Evolutionary biology maintains that males with more testosterone tend to be more sexually desirable , since the hormone selects for certain come - hither traits , such as facial symmetry and bulked - up musculature .Therefore , as potentially fitter mate prospects , it makes sense that those testosterone - rich fellows settled down [ source : Lende ] .Meanwhile , the fatherhood - prompted dip in testosterone production may represent an evolved mechanism for preening hunter - gatherer males into caregivers .In other words , by tamping down on the aggression - sparking and sex drive - revving chemical that is testosterone , the male body essentially settles itself down to help raise the kids , with heightened protective and care - giving instincts [ source : Lende ] .Furthermore , a 2002 study examining the hormonal changes associated with marriage and parenting also revealed that husbands with lower testosterone spend more time with their wives [ source : Gettler et al ] .On the flip side of these family - oriented fellows , a 2002 study from the University of Toronto found that male participants with higher baseline testosterone levels were less sympathetic and responsive toward the sound of crying babies [ source : Gettler et al ] .However , just like the mouse dads that sprouted brain cells in response to offspring interaction , lowered testosterone is n't a standalone turnkey for paternal care - giving .In these cases , behavior seems to presuppose biology , first requiring quality interaction with offspring to signal the male body to dial down testosterone production .Single dads who did n't see their children experienced little hormonal change in the Northwestern University study , for instance [ source : Gettler et al ] .So , while it might seem like less testosterone makes a new father into less of a man , it does the exact opposite .It quite possibly primes that man to become more of a dad .Author 's Note : Do new fathers have lower testosterone than single men ?Lee T.

{"text": "However , as we see above , there is at least preliminary evidence that having high testosterone can focus a male 's attentions and energies on social activities , while low testosterone appears to improve the attention and care that men provide their own young .Both point to the potential benefits of reducing levels of the hormone as social duties shift with the onset of fatherhood .What is the cause of the decline in testosterone among fathers ?In our study we found that fathers who reported spending the most time ( 3 or more hours each day ) with their offspring had lower testosterone levels compared to other fathers who reported spending no time caring for their young .Here once again it is difficult to know what is \" cause \" and what is \" effect \" : does childcare reduce a father 's testosterone , or were fathers with lower testosterone simply more inclined to be involved caregivers ?The short answer is that we can not say for sure , but we do have some hints .Our best guess is that not only did fatherhood lead to a decline in testosterone , but interacting with a child , or some correlate of time spent with a child , influenced how far the levels dipped once men became fathers .Let us explain how we reached this tentative conclusion .Researchers had previously speculated that providing direct care might lead testosterone levels to drop in new fathers .For instance , in a study in Senegal , fathers who showed greater investment in their children , including hands - on childcare , had lower testosterone than fathers who were reported to be less invested .Similarly , another fascinating study looked at testosterone levels in fathers in two cultural groups in Tanzania .Testosterone was only lower among the fathers in the cultural group in which fathers are expected to be involved in offspring care - in the second group , among whom fathers typically are not involved caregivers , fathers did not have lower testosterone than non - fathers .These findings suggested that it is not simply being a father , but a committed father who spends time with his offspring , that seems to influence testosterone levels .Paralleling these findings , we published an article in 2009 that considered a cross - sectional ( \" snap shot \" ) study of relationships between fatherhood , childcare , and testosterone in the young men from Cebu .We found that fathers who identified themselves as primary caregivers to their children had lower testosterone compared to fathers who did not identify themselves as caregivers .Taken together , these studies set the stage for us to consider in greater detail in our new study in PNAS whether the amount of time that a man spends in childcare relates to his testosterone levels .In our new study , we found that men who reported spending more time in childcare each day had the lowest testosterone levels in 2009 .As with examples above , there are several possible interpretations of this finding that we had to consider .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.09661"}

{"text": "New demands and responsibilities during the postpartum period often cause major changes in a father 's life .Thus , it is important to understand how stress factors in a father 's environment affect the development of depression during the postpartum period .Fathers often experience more difficulties in developing emotional bonds with their children than mothers , who tend to develop an attachment almost immediately after a child is born .The father - infant bond appears to develop more gradually over the first two months postpartum .80 Before then , fathers have more difficulties than mothers with emotional bonding with their infants .81The relative slow development of attachment might be related to the father 's feeling of helplessness and depression for the first few postpartum months .One of the factors that may make parenting difficult for many fathers is the absence of a good role model .In recent years , we see a dramatic increase in society 's expectation for fathers to have greater involvement in parenting , yet many fathers report that they did not learn appropriate parenting skills from their own fathers or other male seniors .82 Competence in parenting among fathers is significantly associated with the father 's sense of mastery in his role and family functioning .83 The lack of understanding of what is expected of a father might cause anxiety , especially the first - time fathers , and lead to a greater risk of paternal PPD .Lack of rewards in parenting might also contribute to the development of paternal PPD .Fathers report positive feedbacks , such as smiles from their infants , as the most significant reward in parenting .80 However , a father 's lack of experience in parenting and fewer hours with an infant may tend to make interactions more distressing for the infant .Fathers also report being isolated from mother - infant bonding and feeling jealous about their partners ' dominance in spending intimate time with babies , especially through breastfeeding .3 Interestingly , fathers may report feelings of jealousy toward their babies because the babies occupy a great amount of their partner 's attention .Furthermore , the stress from the relationship with their partners might influence fathers ' moods during the postpartum period .Because of sudden life changes , marital relationships often are threatened during the early postnatal period time .80 Fathers report increased dissatisfaction with their relationships with their partners , including lack of intimacy 85 and the partner 's loss of interest in sexual relationship .30 Some studies found that the quality of relationship not only with their partners but also with their in - laws , especially mothers - in - law , can influence fathers ' involvement in parenting .In marital relationships , fathers ' parenting stress during the postpartum period can be further complicated by the differences in and perceptions of distinct gender roles of fathers and mothers .The emphasis on the man 's role as the breadwinner may be increased due to the increased financial burdens after the birth of the child , and , in turn , may prevent fathers from being more involved in parenting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.258904"}

{"text": "Fatherhood , Childcare , and Testosterone : Study Authors Discuss the Details .Recently we published a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reporting a drop in testosterone levels among newly partnered new fathers .We were gratified to see those findings discussed widely , from the front page of the New York Times to spirited conversations among groups of parents .As the study percolated through the media and across blogs , inevitably some of its nuances , interesting implications , and important limitations were obscured .In addition , news of our results was also used by some to reinforce unfortunate stereotypes about masculinity .Critiques of the interpretation of the study and especially its portrayal in the media have been published ( for example , see critiques here and here ) .Clearly , these findings struck a chord !We would like to contribute to the discussion by providing more scientific detail and context for our findings .We welcome this opportunity to discuss , for example , the previous research that motivated our question , exactly what we found in our study , and why we interpret our findings as we do .We will also discuss the gaps in current understanding that leave open important questions .As others have done in response to this study , we would also like to reflect upon what we think these findings imply about the nature of human males and human fatherhood .Brief introduction to the problem .The idea that testosterone might drop in new fathers first appeared in studies of other species in which mothers and fathers cooperate to raise their young .For instance , fathers are especially involved in caregiving in many bird species , because eggs need to be incubated and protected , and the chicks also need to be fed after they hatch .In many of these species , it was long ago shown that testosterone levels are often high during periods of mating , but then decline once males began caring for their young .Although less common , males among the rare species of mammal in which fathers care for offspring in some cases also show a decrease in testosterone .Researchers hypothesized that this might make good sense : given that testosterone motivates behaviors related to finding and competing for mates , perhaps this social drive was no longer needed , and might even be a distraction , as a male 's duties shifted to caring for dependent young .Starting more than a decade ago , researchers began reporting evidence suggesting that human fathers might also share this pattern of testosterone response .In 2000 , Anne Storey and colleagues published a study showing that expectant fathers had higher testosterone late in their partners ' pregnancies compared to new fathers shortly after their infants were born .In 2009 , we published our first article on testosterone and fatherhood in the Cebu Study that was the focus of the recent PNAS article .Consistent with findings in these other societies , we found that fathers in committed relationships had lower testosterone than single non - fathers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.5525"}

{"text": "As we noted above , in our study we found that fathers who reported being involved in childcare had the lowest levels of evening testosterone .Perhaps more compelling evidence is reported by a study which showed that fathers with lower testosterone expressed greater sympathy towards , and a need to respond to , infant cries .Similarly , a recent study , released just this week , found that men 's testosterone decreased when they heard recorded infant cries , but only if they felt a need to nurture the upset infant .In a separate study examining hormonal changes during father - toddler interaction , Dr. Anne Storey and colleagues concluded that \" ... low baseline testosterone levels or greater testosterone decreases are associated with men being more responsive or attentive to their toddlers . \" Much more research will be needed to clarify the possible effects of lower testosterone on men 's abilities to perform as effective caregivers .However , as we see above , there is at least preliminary evidence that having high testosterone can focus a male 's attentions and energies on social activities , while low testosterone appears to improve the attention and care that men provide their own young .Both point to the potential benefits of reducing levels of the hormone as social duties shift with the onset of fatherhood .What is the cause of the decline in testosterone among fathers ?In our study we found that fathers who reported spending the most time ( 3 or more hours each day ) with their offspring had lower testosterone levels compared to other fathers who reported spending no time caring for their young .Here once again it is difficult to know what is \" cause \" and what is \" effect \" : does childcare reduce a father 's testosterone , or were fathers with lower testosterone simply more inclined to be involved caregivers ?The short answer is that we can not say for sure , but we do have some hints .Our best guess is that not only did fatherhood lead to a decline in testosterone , but interacting with a child , or some correlate of time spent with a child , influenced how far the levels dipped once men became fathers .Let us explain how we reached this tentative conclusion .Researchers had previously speculated that providing direct care might lead testosterone levels to drop in new fathers .For instance , in a study in Senegal , fathers who showed greater investment in their children , including hands - on childcare , had lower testosterone than fathers who were reported to be less invested .Similarly , another fascinating study looked at testosterone levels in fathers in two cultural groups in Tanzania .Testosterone was only lower among the fathers in the cultural group in which fathers are expected to be involved in offspring care - in the second group , among whom fathers typically are not involved caregivers , fathers did not have lower testosterone than non - fathers .These findings suggested that it is not simply being a father , but a committed father who spends time with his offspring , that seems to influence testosterone levels .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.867264"}
{"text": "Androgen Therapy for Women .HIV - positive women may also experience some of the same problems as their male counterparts : muscle wasting , fat gain , fatigue , depression , loss of libido , and impaired sexual function .And , as in men , these symptoms may be due to low testosterone .Normal testosterone levels vary widely from woman to woman ; a typical normal range is 20 - 100 ng / dL for total testosterone or 1 - 2 ng / dL for free testosterone .Low testosterone levels appear to be common in HIV - positive women , especially those with wasting syndrome .In Grinspoon 's 1997 study of women with HIV , 66 % with severe wasting , 50 % with early wasting , and 33 % with no wasting had free testosterone levels below the normal range for healthy women of the same age .Testosterone supplements may be used in women , but require caution to avoid unwanted , and possibly irreversible , virilizing side effects such as excessive facial or body hair growth ( hirsutism ) , hoarseness or deepening of the voice , and clitoral enlargement .For this reason , testosterone patches , creams , or gels are preferred over higher - dose testosterone injections .Compounding pharmacies can prepare creams that contain the desired dose .If virilizing side effects or menstrual changes occur , doses should be lowered or therapy discontinued .Testosterone is contraindicated in women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant .In the April 26 , 2004 issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine , Sara Dolan , NP , and colleagues from the MGH team reported that twice - weekly testosterone patches improved muscle function in this population .Importantly , however , more testosterone is not necessarily better .In Miller 's study , the same benefits were not seen in women who received supraphysiological doses of testosterone ( two patches twice weekly ) .Some researchers think anabolic steroids with less androgenic effects , such as nandrolone and oxandrolone , may be a better option for women , although these agents may not provide the same benefits in terms of improving libido or relieving depression .At the 8th Retrovirus conference in February 2001 , Kathleen Mulligan , M.D. , from San Francisco General Hospital presented results of a study of 38 HIV - positive women with wasting randomly assigned to receive nandrolone or placebo .The women in the nandrolone arm experienced increased total weight and lean body mass , while virilizing side effects were rare .To date , however , neither nandrolone nor oxandrolone has been adequately studied in women with HIV .Grinspoon recommends only natural testosterone , since synthetic anabolic steroids may adversely affect the liver .Another option is combined testosterone / estrogen therapy ( e.g. , Estratest ) .For some women , supplementing both androgens and estrogens appears to improve menopausal symptoms , energy , and libido more than either alone .HIV - positive transgender individuals who are using hormone therapy for gender transition face some special concerns .Individuals transitioning from male to female usually take oral estrogen ( with or without androgen - blocking drugs ) , while individuals transitioning from female to male typically use injected testosterone and sometimes aromatase inhibitors to block the conversion of testosterone to estrogen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.049805"}

{"text": "We found that fathers who identified themselves as primary caregivers to their children had lower testosterone compared to fathers who did not identify themselves as caregivers .Taken together , these studies set the stage for us to consider in greater detail in our new study in PNAS whether the amount of time that a man spends in childcare relates to his testosterone levels .In our new study , we found that men who reported spending more time in childcare each day had the lowest testosterone levels in 2009 .As with examples above , there are several possible interpretations of this finding that we had to consider .In fact , as we reported in the study , we did not find this - the amount of time a man spent in childcare in 2009 was unrelated to his baseline testosterone levels .Based upon the finding , we think it unlikely that low testosterone before men were fathers led to more childcare .Instead our best guess is that childcare , or some behavior or activity that is associated with childcare , somehow lowered the testosterone levels of highly - involved fathers in our sample .It is important to note that several recent experimental studies ( here and here ) , including our own , have failed to find that testosterone drops immediately in fathers after they interact with their children .For instance , in a recent study of 42 fathers in our study , we looked at hormone levels before and 30 and 60 minutes after they interacted with their offspring .Testosterone levels were stable across this period .This could indicate that interacting with a child does not lead to a drop in testosterone .However it could also indicate that we did not measure men over a long enough period of interaction to see a biological response .For instance , a father 's body might only \" reset \" hormone levels in response to more extended periods of interaction , such as over weeks or months .That is , was the intensity and number of hours spent in childcare influenced by the drop in testosterone experienced by new fathers , rather than vice versa ?Addressing these various possibilities will require new studies with more fine - grained data on testosterone and paternal care as fathers engage with their newborn babies in the weeks and months after birth .We look forward to seeing what future studies reveal !What are the possible effects of the testosterone drop on a man 's behavior and health ?Fathers who learned of our findings expressed a range of emotions , from excitement to fascination to concern .If testosterone declines with the onset of fatherhood , what effects on behavior or health might this have ?Here we briefly review the evidence linking testosterone with several of the traits that men seemed to express most concern about , in hopes of dispelling some of the concerns that were raised .First , as we noted above , the largest drops in testosterone were seen in fathers whose partners had only recently given birth to newborns .Although fathers ' testosterone declined more than non - fathers regardless of child age , evening testosterone declined a median of 49 % in fathers of newborns compared to 34 % in other new fathers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.179855"}

{"text": "In 2000 , Anne Storey and colleagues published a study showing that expectant fathers had higher testosterone late in their partners ' pregnancies compared to new fathers shortly after their infants were born .In 2009 , we published our first article on testosterone and fatherhood in the Cebu Study that was the focus of the recent PNAS article .Consistent with findings in these other societies , we found that fathers in committed relationships had lower testosterone than single non - fathers .We also showed that fathers who reported being a primary caregiver to their children had low testosterone , especially in the evening , compared to fathers who did not consider themselves one of their child 's primary childcare providers .Thus , many biologists and anthropologists , including our research team , have assumed for some time that fatherhood likely lowers a man 's testosterone levels , as many of the past studies suggested that men likely conform to the pattern seen in other species with paternal care .However , this evidence , although fascinating , did not allow definitive conclusions to be reached about whether fatherhood reduced a man 's testosterone levels .This was because these studies were \" cross - sectional \" , meaning that they only measured fatherhood status and hormones as a single snapshot during one visit and interview .Had the act of becoming fathers reduced these men 's testosterone ?Or alternatively , were the men who had low testosterone to begin with simply more likely to have become fathers ?Both scenarios could explain these findings equally well , and so the matter remained unsettled .What we found in our new study .As noted above , when we first measured testosterone among the men in our study in 2005 we found that fathers had lower testosterone levels than the men who were single at that time .What makes our new study unique is that we measured these same men a second time about 5 years later .Importantly , because the men were quite young , many of them became fathers for the first time during this 5 year period , which allowed us to test whether new fathers experienced a greater drop in their hormone levels compared to men who remained single and childless .We found that the single men who ended up being partnered fathers 5 years later had higher testosterone when the study began .This is important , because it allowed us to rule out the other possible interpretation of our data - that men with low testosterone were simply more likely to become fathers .That was clearly not the case in our sample .We also found that , once these men became fathers , their testosterone levels went down substantially , and more dramatically than other groups of men .In fact , most of the men in the sample experienced some decline in testosterone during this 5 year period .Testosterone levels tend to peak in early adulthood and then gradually decline with age , so this was expected .But the new fathers experienced much greater declines than would be expected based upon age alone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.810402"}

{"text": "Conclusion .This research highlighted a possible link between both testes size and testosterone levels and caregiving tendencies among a small number of fathers of children under two years old .One of the main limitations of the study was that it was cross - sectional and therefore can not determine whether variations in testosterone levels could be directly responsible for the differences in caregiving seen .The study also did not account for a range of factors which could also affect paternal caregiving - for example , their own father 's involvement , and the influences of cultural and societal expectations on the role of the father .The effects of these other factors could potentially play a larger role than any biological effects , but this was not explored .Parental caregiving desire and practice could be heavily influenced by culture , religion , social status , geographical location , or life circumstances at the time .So the study represents an attempt to isolate the biological influence on parental caregiving away from these other complex societal factors .However , by not taking into account these influences , the results may have been significantly biased .Future researchers should factor in societal , ethical and cultural influences to assess the dual influence of biology and circumstance together , to get an idea of the relative influences and how they interact .The researchers acknowledged that external factors , such as stress or socioeconomic status , could be related to testosterone and may also interfere with fathers ' ability to take a more active parental role , despite a desire to be active in their child 's life .The study did not assess parenting involvement past the age of two years so could not report on whether the father became more or less involved over time .The researchers also assessed some of the indirect attempts of fathers to support their children , through working longer hours and increasing household income , rather than changing nappies .However , this was a relatively narrow and short - term assessment of the possible indirect ways a father might be attempting to support the family .This means indirect caregiving activities might not have been properly factored into the results and conclusions .Overall , this study does not prove that men with larger testes or higher testosterone levels will naturally be less involved in child caregiving than those with smaller testes or lower testosterone levels , or vice versa .It did , however , tentatively suggest there may be link between the two that may relate to evolutionary pressures .The relative effect of this in relation to societal and cultural expectations of fatherhood was not assessed and may be significant .Does testicle size play a role in parental ability ? \" Want to know if your partner will be a good dad ?Measure his testicles : Men with small glands are more involved in parenting , \" was the Daily Mail 's take on research into what makes some men more involved in parenting than others .Researchers asked small groups of mothers and fathers of infants about the ways and amount the dads were involved in raising their child .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.110676"}

{"text": "For fathers , different types of support may ease the transition process to fatherhood during the postpartum period .The most effective supports likely come from their partners because paternal PPD is closely related to partners ' mental health and their relationship with the fathers .More encouragement from a mother and active discussion in each couple as they await and prepare for their baby may help the father 's involvement in parenting and ease the stress as a new father .Mothers sharing parenting roles with fathers may also lower fathers ' feelings of isolation from the relationship between mother - infant , as well as difficult feelings , such as jealousy toward the infant .Furthermore , support and acknowledgement from other family members about the father 's role and understanding the difficulties the fathers may encounter may have a positive effect on fathers .Educational programs in the community help fathers understand their expected roles .Findings suggest that a program for PPD mothers and their partners is more effective then a program with PPD mothers alone .87 For the same reason , a program for both PPD fathers and mothers could be more effective to alleviate paternal PPD .In addition , because anxiety and depressed mood might start during the partner 's pregnancy , earlier intervention for both parents would be more effective before the symptoms become serious .Support from society , such as paid paternity leave , would help fathers adapt to changes during the postpartum period .The US has no policy for paid paternity or maternity leave . 88Globally , there are 45 countries with policies for paid paternity leave or parental leave ( leave used as maternity or paternity leave ) , and 27 countries guarantee paid paternity leave .In the case of Finland , 68 percent of fathers use a three - week leave with part pay .89 Policy for paternity leave in Sweden has experienced changes to encourage fathers to exercise their right to paternal leave .78 \" Father 's quota \" allocates 30 days among 450 days of parental leave for paternal leave .This means if fathers do not use 30 days for paternal leave , the days of parental leave will be lost .In addition to ' Father 's quota , ' fathers in Sweden have 10 days of paternity leave and allowance to take care of their families at home .This parental leave can be used any time until a child becomes 18 months old .There is accumulating evidence that there are benefits to child outcomes of positive paternity leave .For example , Feldman and colleagues 90 showed that longer paternal leave is associated with a more positive attitude toward parenting .On the other hand , the shorter paternal leave is associated with low quality of child care and less adaptation at work among fathers .Lack of understanding and lack of a supportive network for new fathers is common .28 Traditionally , fathers have been largely recognized only as support providers for their partners .However , given a recent increase in fathers ' involvement in parenting , proper supports from the society that focus on the active roles of fathers would help new fathers ease their stress in the early postpartum period .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.664192"}

{"text": "March 4 , 2008 .Testosterone Levels Linked to Depression .A new Australian study found men over 70 with low testosterone levels may be more susceptible to depression .In the study , a team of researchers from University of Western Australia examined about 4,000 men aged 70 or older and found a three - fold increase in depression among those with the lowest testosterone levels .The scientists believe the hormone may affect levels of key brain chemicals associated with depression .Previous research had found among those under 65 , women were more likely to be depressed than men .However , after age 65 the difference in depression rates between the genders becomes negligible .In performing their study , the Australian research team examined 3,987 men over the age of 70 .Each participant gave blood samples and took tests to determine if they were depressed .In total , 203 of the participants were assessed as being depressed , and had substantially lower levels of both total testosterone and free testosterone , which is not bound to proteins .The researchers adjusted the data to account for additional factors such as educational attainment and body fat levels .They found those participants whose level of free testosterone was in the bottom 20 % were three times more likely to be depressed than those in the top 20 % .The researchers said further work was required to confirm their findings .Testosterone levels decline with age , but with wide variation .But the study raises the possibility that effective treatments for depression might come from boosting testosterone levels in older men .Previous studies on testosterone and depression had revealed links between the two .A study of 800 men over 50 found those with low testosterone levels had a 33 % increased risk of death over an 18-year period than those with higher levels .Those with low testosterone levels appeared significantly more likely to have a cluster of risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes , raising the possibility that men with low testosterone may be prone to depression because they are also more likely to be in poor physical health .However , the Australian research found that this could not fully explain the association , and suggests other factors must also be at work .Professor David Kendall , a pharmacology expert at the University of Nottingham in the UK , told BBC News there was a wealth of evidence that testosterone levels are linked to mood .For instance , farmers had long castrated their stock to pacify them .Animal research has also shown that removal of the gonads blocked the action of anti - depressants on key mood - controlling chemicals in the brain .\" It would be no surprise that low testosterone reduces mood , \" Kendall said .\" Testosterone therapy offers a relatively simple intervention , potentially , for some groups of older depressives with hypogonadism ( low production of sex hormones ) .\" Professor Stafford Lightman , a hormone expert at the University of Bristol , said testosterone potentially had many small effects that could raise depression risks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.723633"}

{"text": "Menstrual problems in HIV - positive women are seen less often since the advent of HAART , but anti - HIV treatment itself may sometimes contribute to such irregularities .Much remains to be learned about how female sex hormones and the immune system interact .For example , hormonal factors appear to influence women 's vulnerability to HIV infection ( see table below ) .Studies have shown that HIV - positive women have higher CD4 cell counts than men who have been infected for a similar length of time , and show greater disease progression than men with the same CD4 cell counts .Hormonal factors may also help explain differences in how women and men metabolize antiretroviral drugs .Research suggests that female sex hormones play a role in HIV transmission and acquisition .Some studies indicate that levels of HIV in women 's genital fluids fluctuate over the course of the menstrual cycle as hormone levels change , which could have implications for sexual and mother - to - child transmission .In addition , Chia Wang , M.D. , of the University of Washington and colleagues reported in the January 23 , 2004 issue of AIDS that use of hormonal contraceptives was associated with increased cervical shedding of HIV .Hormone levels also appear to affect women 's vulnerability to infection .Other research suggests that the use of oral or injected hormonal contraceptives without additional barrier methods increases the likelihood that women will contract HIV .Looking at a subset of more than 150 women who seroconverted , the same team found that women using hormonal contraceptives at the time of infection were more likely to have a higher viral load set - point and multiple viral variants , which are associated with more rapid disease progression .As HIV - positive women live longer , they are subject to the same age - related hormonal changes as their HIV - negative counterparts .The use of hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) in women with or without HIV is currently controversial .Menopause typically ensues between the late thirties and late fifties .During menopause and the preceding period known as peri - menopause , declining estrogen levels can cause symptoms such as hot flashes , night sweats , insomnia , fatigue , depression , irritability , forgetfulness , and vaginal thinning and dryness .The more intense symptoms typically improve over two to three years as hormone fluctuations even out .A careful differential diagnosis is necessary to avoid confusing symptoms of menopause with those related to HIV itself , OIs , or antiretroviral therapy .For young women who experience premature amenorrhea before the normal age of menopause , oral contraceptives may be used to restore levels of estrogen and progesterone and re - establish normal menstrual cycles .For older women undergoing menopause , physicians have traditionally offered HRT using either oral estrogen ( e.g. , Premarin ) or estrogen plus progesterone ( e.g. , Prempro ) .HRT did lower the risk of hip fractures and colon cancer , but the researchers concluded that the overall risks outweighed the benefits .This past March the estrogen - only arm of the study was also halted after seven - year data revealed that estrogen not only failed to provide the hoped - for cardiovascular benefits , but also appeared to slightly raise the risk of strokes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.15724"}
{"text": "Further studies are needed to show whether such correlations can be extrapolated to all fathers during the postpartum period and if they might be part of an excessive adjustment .If proven , testosterone levels might contribute to a biological explanation of paternal PPD and even point toward a means of testing and prevention .Second , paternal PPD might be related to lower levels of estrogen .Among men , the estrogen level begins to increase during the last month of his partner 's pregnancy until the early postpartum period .69 Given findings on the relation between increased levels of estrogen and maternal behaviors , 70 the increase in estrogen in a father might enhance more active parenting behaviors after the birth of his child .Fleming and colleagues 63 also found that the more involved the father is in parenting , the higher the level his estrogen is compared to other fathers .In rats , increased numbers of estrogen receptors in brain areas important for parental behaviors , including the medial preoptic area , are associated with parental experience with pups .71 Perhaps then dysregulation of paternal estrogen may disturb paternal behaviors and constitute another important risk factor for any depressed mood in fathers .Third , paternal PPD might be related to lower levels of cortisol , a hormone that regulates the physiological responses to stressful events .72 High cortisol levels are generally associated with high stress levels .However , for a mother , during the early postpartum period , high cortisol levels are associated with increased sensitivity toward her infant 73 and with less depressed mood .74 Thus , the lower levels of cortisol among certain fathers might be related to difficulties in father - infant bonding and associated depressed mood .Fourth , paternal PPD might be related to low vasopressin levels , which increase after the birth of the child in a way analogous to the oxytocin level of the mother .75 Based on research in prairie voles , vasopressin appears to play an important role in enhancing the development of parent - infant bonding for fathers .76A recent primate study reported on marmoset fathers , which are noted for their extensive involvement in parenting , particularly early postpartum period with behaviors such as carrying , protecting , and feeding their offspring .77 These paternal behaviors during the first month of the infant 's life are associated with a rapid increase of vasopressin receptors in the prefrontal cortex of the brain .This particular brain area is important for planning and organizing appropriate parental behavior .78 Perhaps then , human fathers with low levels of vasopressin may have difficulties with parenting behaviors and so again be more vulnerable to depression .Fifth , paternal PPD might be related to changes in prolactin levels .Prolactin is important for the onset and maintenance of parental behaviors .64 Prolactin levels in men rise during pregnancy and continue to rise during the first postnatal year . 64High prolactin levels are related to greater responses to infant stimuli among new fathers . 64Thus , a lower prolactin level could cause a father to experience difficulties in adapting to parenthood and thus exhibit more negative moods .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.185066"}
{"text": "When diagnosing endocrine problems it is important to look not just at absolute levels of specific hormones , but also at the balance between them .For example , if a man begins to convert more testosterone to estrogen , his androgen / estrogen ratio will shift and he may begin to experience \" feminizing \" symptoms such as breast growth , even if his testosterone remains within the statistically normal range .Also , a testosterone level within the normal range may be inadequate for a given individual if his usual level is higher .Some experts recommend getting a baseline testosterone measurement soon after HIV is diagnosed , against which later measurements may be compared .Hypogonadal men can be treated with supplemental testosterone or synthetic androgens .Testosterone may be administered in several forms .Testosterone cypionate or enanthate are injected intramuscularly , usually every 2 - 4 weeks .While this is the least expensive method , cyclical injections provide fluctuating blood levels of the hormone , peaking soon after administration and decreasing over time .Transdermal testosterone patches provide a more steady level .The Testoderm patch is applied daily to the scrotum , while the newer Androderm patch is applied daily to the back , abdomen , upper arm , or thigh .Testosterone gel ( AndroGel ) and creams are also available .Oral testosterone pills are not commonly used since they can cause liver toxicity .Injected testosterone may increase overall body weight and especially lean body mass .In the July 1 , 1998 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine , Grinspoon and colleagues reported that hypogonadal men with HIV - associated wasting gained muscle mass and reported improved appearance and quality of life after six months of testosterone therapy ( one injection every three weeks ) .Grinspoon 's team also found that Beck Depression Inventory scores decreased ( indicating improvement ) in men treated with testosterone .Testosterone skin patches are also effective .More recently , testosterone has been studied as a treatment for lipodystrophy and other metabolic manifestations associated with HAART .In individuals with mixed lipodystrophy ( loss of fat from the limbs and face accompanied by abdominal fat gain ) , the hormone may both decrease fat and increase lean tissue mass .Further , Wesley Fairfield , M.D. , from MGH and colleagues reported that testosterone therapy led to increased bone density in eugonadal HIV - positive men with osteopenia .In addition to testosterone , synthetic androgenic steroids may also be used .Some have a more androgenic ( masculinizing ) effect , while others have a more anabolic ( muscle - building ) effect .The latter may provide some of the benefits of testosterone without unwanted virilization , which is especially important for women , as discussed below .Steroids with more anabolic effects include nandrolone decanoate ( Deca - Durabolin ) , which is injected every 1 - 2 weeks , and oxandrolone ( Oxandrin ) , which is taken orally every day .Julian Gold , M.D. , and colleagues from Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney reported in the June 1996 issue of AIDS that nandrolone increased lean body mass , enhanced exercise performance , and improved quality of life in HIV - infected hypogonadal men .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.26073"}

{"text": "The experience of sexual orgasm is enhanced for both men and women by testosterone .The pituitary hormone oxytocin rises dramatically as well , enhancing skin and sexual organ sensitivity .Sexual fulfillment is accomplished by the rise in oxytocin ( sometimes called the \" touchy , feely \" hormone ) .Oxytocin is enhanced by estrogen and antagonized by a high testosterone level .Finally , sexual bonding , or love and marriage , is mediated in women by the estrogen - induced enhancement of oxytocin .For men , testosterone activates the pituitary hormone vasopressin , which causes them to pursue females and become territorial .So , it is easy to see how a sex hormone imbalance can affect multiple aspects of sexuality , with a domino - like effect .In men , one of the first signs of a testosterone deficiency is a diminished libido , which can lead to problems with sexual function and fulfillment , which then further compounds the problem because these are often tied to a man 's sense of overall well - being and self - worth .In this way , sexual problems can contribute to mental or emotional problems ( such as a damaged self - esteem , moodiness , and depression ) , which can further compound the sexual problems , and without treatment the cycle continues .How Does Estrogen Affect Testosterone ?The effects of testosterone are further complicated by its relationship to another sex hormone - estrogen , especially estradiol .As discussed earlier , the yin - yang balance between the estrogen hormones and testosterone is key for both men and women ; together , they define our sexuality .Fortunately , the human body is amazingly adept at converting what it has to what it needs .In the male body , an abundant supply of testosterone combines with a plentiful enzyme called aromatase to produce estrogen when and where it is needed .Dr. Shippen believes that \" men 's bodies would not have a process for making estrogen if it were useless to them . \"He identifies many estrogen - sensitive areas of the male body , including the brain , and explains that estrogen is an extremely important aspect of the brain chemistry that triggers natural sexual functions .He states , \" Too little estrogen will neuter a man just as effectively as too little testosterone . \"However , for most adult men , the problem is not too little estrogen , but too much !A primary cause of hormone imbalance in men as they age is that testosterone is increasingly converted to estrogen , resulting in an excess of estradiol .Life Extension recommends that men maintain estradiol levels between 21.8 and 30.1 pg / mL. Similar to how women react to minute amounts of testosterone , men have a very small window of optimum effectiveness when it comes to estrogen .Because the estrogen derived from aromatase actually displaces testosterone at the receptor sites , it has the effect of \" turning off \" testosterone - driven activities or regulating the force of those actions .In this way , estrogen and testosterone exist in a delicate yin - yang balance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.748894"}

{"text": "Introduction .Humans are among a relatively restricted group of mammals , 5 % or less , that display male paternal care [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .It is not uncommon for fathers to provide direct care to dependent offspring well into the second decade of their life , often even caring for multiple overlapping offspring at the same time ( e.g. , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ) .As a consequence of paternal investment human males must regulate the time and energy they allocate between mating and parental effort [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .Wingfield , Hegner , Duffy , and Ball 's ' challenge hypothesis ' , based on research from bird species , suggests that testosterone ( T ) helps to regulate the trade - off between mating and parenting [ 5 ] .Specifically , it explains the function of varied T levels in seasonally breeding birds , wherein T levels rise in the mating season and then subsequently drop during the period of brooding and parental care .The challenge hypothesis , reviewed in [ 6 ] , has since been adapted to also account for changes in mating and parenting effort in humans ( review in [ 7 ] , example : [ 8 ] ) .Of course , in humans , breeding does not follow a seasonal pattern , instead human males experience high chronic T levels and can pursue mating opportunities throughout their lifespan [ 9 ] .Nonetheless , research on the life history of human males appears to support the idea that T is intricately involved in regulating mating and pair bonding / parenting behavior ( for review : [ 10 ] ) .Low male T levels have been shown to promote features relevant to parenting or investment [ 7 ] .For example , married men are known to have lower T levels than samples of matched men who are unmarried ( e.g. , [ 11 ] - [ 14 ] ) .Likewise , men who are in committed relationships have been shown to have lower levels of T than uncommitted single men ( e.g. , [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] ) .A complementary line of research has shown that the transition to fatherhood is also associated with a decrease in T levels ( e.g. , [ 13 ] , [ 17 ] - [ 20 ] ) .The role of low T in facilitating parenting seems to be robust : in non - Western populations fathers have also been found to have lower T levels than non - fathers [ 17 ] , [ 19 ] - [ 21 ] .The adjustment of T levels upon the transition to fatherhood has been proposed to facilitate better fathering through priming men to provide care [ 22 ] .Yet , T levels have been found to be negatively related to paternal investment in three studies from non - Western cultures [ 17 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] .The notion of low levels of T being associated with nurturing responses is , however , consistent with recent laboratory based work by van Anders and colleagues [ 24 ] who showed that providing a nurturing response to a crying doll decreases male T levels .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.99319"}

{"text": "A new Australian study found men over 70 with low testosterone levels may be more susceptible to depression .In the study , a team of researchers from University of Western Australia examined about 4,000 men aged 70 or older and found a three - fold increase in depression among those with the lowest testosterone levels .The scientists believe the hormone may affect levels of key brain chemicals associated with depression .Previous research had found among those under 65 , women were more likely to be depressed than men .However , after age 65 the difference in depression rates between the genders becomes negligible .In performing their study , the Australian research team examined 3,987 men over the age of 70 .Each participant gave blood samples and took tests to determine if they were depressed .In total , 203 of the participants were assessed as being depressed , and had substantially lower levels of both total testosterone and free testosterone , which is not bound to proteins .The researchers adjusted the data to account for additional factors such as educational attainment and body fat levels .They found those participants whose level of free testosterone was in the bottom 20 % were three times more likely to be depressed than those in the top 20 % .The researchers said further work was required to confirm their findings .Testosterone levels decline with age , but with wide variation .But the study raises the possibility that effective treatments for depression might come from boosting testosterone levels in older men .Previous studies on testosterone and depression had revealed links between the two .A study of 800 men over 50 found those with low testosterone levels had a 33 % increased risk of death over an 18-year period than those with higher levels .Those with low testosterone levels appeared significantly more likely to have a cluster of risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes , raising the possibility that men with low testosterone may be prone to depression because they are also more likely to be in poor physical health .However , the Australian research found that this could not fully explain the association , and suggests other factors must also be at work .Professor David Kendall , a pharmacology expert at the University of Nottingham in the UK , told BBC News there was a wealth of evidence that testosterone levels are linked to mood .For instance , farmers had long castrated their stock to pacify them .Animal research has also shown that removal of the gonads blocked the action of anti - depressants on key mood - controlling chemicals in the brain .\" It would be no surprise that low testosterone reduces mood , \" Kendall said .\" Testosterone therapy offers a relatively simple intervention , potentially , for some groups of older depressives with hypogonadism ( low production of sex hormones ) .\" Professor Stafford Lightman , a hormone expert at the University of Bristol , said testosterone potentially had many small effects that could raise depression risks .For instance , low levels have been linked to poor cognitive performance , and indeed testosterone replacement therapy has been shown to help some elderly men with mild Alzheimer 's disease .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.75391"}
{"text": "Much has already been written about the dangerous side - effects that can result when athletes abuse a testosterone supplement by injecting anabolic steroids to build muscle mass .Newer and easier - to - use testosterone gels and creams may also lead to a temporary excess of testosterone if not used appropriately , but it is rare that testosterone levels will remain excessive as a result of these supplements .A more likely and perhaps equally dangerous result from excessive natural testosterone supplementation is a high rate of testosterone conversion to estrogen .However , Dr. Hertoghe cautions that an excess of any hormone often indicates a deficiency of other hormones , so a thorough hormone test is probably wise before assuming that the problem is entirely related to testosterone levels .The most important thing to remember is that the benefits of testosterone therapy far outweigh the potential drawbacks , especially when there is appropriate delivery , dosage , and monitoring .In fact , a landmark study using HIV - positive men demonstrated that testosterone therapy was safe and effective , even for such extreme cases with numerous additional medical complications .References .Dr. Thierry Hertoghe ; American Academy of Anti - Aging Medicine ; Las Vegas , NV ; December 1999 .Connections is a publication of Women 's International Pharmacy , which is dedicated to the education and management of PMS , menopause , infertility , postpartum depression , and other hormone - related conditions and therapies .This publication is distributed with the understanding that it does not constitute medical advice for individual problems .Although material is intended to be accurate , proper medical advice should be sought from a competent healthcare professional .Publisher : Constance Kindschi Hegerfeld , Executive VP , Women 's International Pharmacy Co- Editors : Julie Johnson and Carol Petersen , RPh , CNP ; Women 's International Pharmacy Writer : Kathleen McCormick , McCormick Communications Illustrator : Amelia Janes , Midwest Educational Graphics .Copyright \u00a9 March 2012 , Women 's International Pharmacy .This newsletter may be printed from the PDF version and photocopied for educational purposes , provided that your copy(s ) include full copyright and contact information .Testosterone .Costs of Hypogonadism .September 29 , 2012 .Prevalence studies have shown that nearly 39 % of men over the age of 45 presenting to primary care offices have signs and symptoms of hypogonadism .While prior studies on male hypogonadism have demonstrated a significant economic and quality - of - life burden , these previous trials have not evaluated the direct or indirect impacts of hypogonadism on healthcare utilization and costs in US men .A recent study sought to compare direct healthcare and indirect ( disability leave or medical absence ) costs between privately insured US men with hypogonadism and controls without hypogonadism .The study included a sample size of 4,269 employed men ages 35 - 64 with 2 or more hypogonadism diagnoses .Employees and controls had a mean age of 51 years .This study demonstrated that men with hypogonadism had higher statistically significant comorbidity rates compared to controls with respect to hyperlipidemia , hypertension , musculoskeletal pain , and human immunodeficiency virus infection , which are directly related to increased financial costs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.813347"}

{"text": "Prenatal and childbirth classes were n't much help either because very little time was spent on topics directly related to being a father .Support from friends and family tended to be focused on the mom 's needs as if she would be the only one affected by the birth of the baby .While dads wanted to support their partners , they felt that little useful information or advice was offered to them .Dealing with Reality .Just as many mothers anticipate what their babies will be like , fathers spend much of pregnancy imagining their new lives with a newborn .The babies in parents ' dreams are often nothing like the real thing .Many men have little experience caring for babies and some new fathers know almost nothing about newborns or how to care for them .Fathers in the studies reported feeling frustrated because they wanted their babies and partners to be happy yet they did n't have the skills to be much help .Dads were overwhelmed by the work needed to take care of babies and the sudden radical changes in their relationships with their partners .They relied on trial and error , friends , and their partners to help them build their confidence as new dads .Over time , they learned how to recognize and address their babies ' needs .Despite their new abilities , many of the dads found that their efforts were n't recognized by friends , family , or professionals .They were still seen as the \" second string \" when it came to parenting and the lack of recognition of their importance in their babies ' lives was a big source of frustration .Building a Bond .In the 1960s ( of Mad Men fame ) , the stereotypical man went back to work the day after his baby was born and accordingly , he had very little to do with his child until he bought him / her a basketball as an 8th birthday present .Those days are long gone .Most of today 's fathers want to play an active role in their children 's lives .Dads in the studies enjoyed spending time with their newborns and feeling that they were providing the care their babies needed , especially when their babies were able to respond by calming down or smiling back at them .Dads sometimes thought that feeding was the only way to bond with babies and some fathers of breastfeeding babies reported being disappointed that they had to \" wait \" to bond with their babies until breastfeeding was over .Of course , Secrets readers know that feeding is only part of parents ' connections with babies .Building baby care skills helped fathers in the studies feel more confident , connected , and in control .They learned how to support and protect their new families through trial and error , from other dads , and reading .We know we have dad - readers out there and we hope that you 'll share your questions with us .Let us know what 's confusing you ; we 're here to help .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.85621"}

{"text": "But the general assumption among many anthropologists who study the role of hormones in human fatherhood is that these behaviors represent time investments that would likely detract from a man 's ability to be an effective and attentive father and caregiver .Although there are very few available studies that have evaluated the effects of testosterone on fathering behaviors , there is preliminary evidence that lower testosterone can sensitize men to being more involved as caregivers .As we noted above , in our study we found that fathers who reported being involved in childcare had the lowest levels of evening testosterone .Perhaps more compelling evidence is reported by a study which showed that fathers with lower testosterone expressed greater sympathy towards , and a need to respond to , infant cries .Similarly , a recent study , released just this week , found that men 's testosterone decreased when they heard recorded infant cries , but only if they felt a need to nurture the upset infant .In a separate study examining hormonal changes during father - toddler interaction , Dr. Anne Storey and colleagues concluded that \" ... low baseline testosterone levels or greater testosterone decreases are associated with men being more responsive or attentive to their toddlers . \" Much more research will be needed to clarify the possible effects of lower testosterone on men 's abilities to perform as effective caregivers .However , as we see above , there is at least preliminary evidence that having high testosterone can focus a male 's attentions and energies on social activities , while low testosterone appears to improve the attention and care that men provide their own young .Both point to the potential benefits of reducing levels of the hormone as social duties shift with the onset of fatherhood .What is the cause of the decline in testosterone among fathers ?In our study we found that fathers who reported spending the most time ( 3 or more hours each day ) with their offspring had lower testosterone levels compared to other fathers who reported spending no time caring for their young .Here once again it is difficult to know what is \" cause \" and what is \" effect \" : does childcare reduce a father 's testosterone , or were fathers with lower testosterone simply more inclined to be involved caregivers ?The short answer is that we can not say for sure , but we do have some hints .Our best guess is that not only did fatherhood lead to a decline in testosterone , but interacting with a child , or some correlate of time spent with a child , influenced how far the levels dipped once men became fathers .Let us explain how we reached this tentative conclusion .Researchers had previously speculated that providing direct care might lead testosterone levels to drop in new fathers .For instance , in a study in Senegal , fathers who showed greater investment in their children , including hands - on childcare , had lower testosterone than fathers who were reported to be less invested .Similarly , another fascinating study looked at testosterone levels in fathers in two cultural groups in Tanzania .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.95877"}

{"text": "In one study , almost every mammalian species examined demonstrated a marked increase in a male 's testosterone level upon encountering a novel female .P.J. James et al . investigated the role of genotype on such so - called reflexive testosterone increases in male mice .They also concluded that this response is related to the male 's initial level of sexual arousal .In non - human primates it has been suggested that testosterone in puberty stimulates sexual motivation , which allows the primate to increasingly seek out sexual experiences with females and thus creates a sexual preference for females .Some research has also indicated that if testosterone is eliminated in an adult male human or other adult male primate 's system , its sexual motivation decreases , but there is no corresponding decrease in ability to engage in sexual activity ( mounting , ejaculating , etc . ) .Higher levels of testosterone were associated with periods of sexual activity within subjects , but between subjects testosterone levels were higher for less sexually active individuals .Men who have sexual encounters with unfamiliar or multiple partners experience large increases of testosterone the morning after .Men who watch a sexually explicit movie have an average increase of 35 % in testosterone , peaking at 60 - 90 minutes after the end of the film , but no increase is seen in men who watch sexually neutral films .Men who watch sexually explicit films also report increased optimism and decreased exhaustion .Previous research has found a link between relaxation following sexual arousal and testosterone levels .Testosterone increases in men who engage in brief conversations with women .This result was seen in heterosexual men who had engaged in sexual activity in the 6 months prior to the study .The increase in T levels was associated with the amount of \" courtship \" behaviours that the men exhibited .Men 's levels of testosterone , a hormone known to affect men 's mating behaviour , changes depending on whether they are exposed to an ovulating or nonovulating woman 's body odour .Men who are exposed to scents of ovulating women maintained a stable testosterone level that was higher than the testosterone level of men exposed to nonovulation cues .Testosterone levels and sexual arousal in men are heavily aware of hormone cycles in females .In a 1991 study , males were exposed to either visual or auditory erotic stimuli and asked to complete a cognitive task , where the number of errors on the task indicated how distracted the participant was by the stimuli .It concluded that men with lower thresholds for sexual arousal have a greater likelihood to attend to sexual information and that testosterone may have an impact by enhancing their attention to the relevant stimuli .Sperm competition theory : Testosterone levels are shown to increase as a response to previously neutral stimuli when conditioned to become sexual in male rats .This reaction engages penile reflexes ( such as erection and ejaculation ) that aid in sperm competition when more than one male is present in mating encounters , allowing for more production of successful sperm and a higher chance of reproduction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.11895"}

{"text": "Indeed , in this same dataset we have previously shown that men with higher T levels report more sex partners [ 35 ] .Similarly , previous research has shown that men with higher T levels are more likely to get divorced [ 12 ] .Taken together , these behaviors may result in the fathering of more children during their lifespan than fathers who did not engage in the acquisition of more sex partners .However , our results did not show that fathers with high T levels had more children because they remarried or because they had more sex partners .It may be that this effect was obscured because of social desirability in responses , which could especially cause men with a family ( i.e. , fathers ) to underreport extramarital affairs .Apart from the acquisition of more sex partners by men with high T levels , additional mechanisms are plausible .It could be that those fathers with high T levels were more fertile than those with lower T levels .However , when considering fertile men , a recent study found no relationship between semen quality and T levels [ 59 ] .This latter finding suggests that increased fertility is not a likely explanation for our finding .It could be that , although a certain level of T is mandatory for fertility , higher T levels do not lead to increased fertility among men who are already fertile .Furthermore , rather than a direct effect of T on fertility , there could also be a number of indirect effects of T on the number of children a man has .For example , lower T levels are positively associated with obesity , stress and exposure to industrial pollutants ( reviewed in [ 60 ] ) .It could thus be that those men with high T levels have more children since they are more physically motivated and capable , and thus experience more opportunities for mating than men with lower T levels .However , this relationship does not seem that likely since we controlled for BMI , which is an important health indicator .Finally , we found that T levels were not associated with either motherhood or number of living children in our female sample .This finding is in contrast to the results of Kuzawa and colleagues [ 38 ] .In this respect , it is important to note that androgen levels of postmenopausal women are substantially different from those of women of reproductive age ( e.g , [ 61 ] ) .Moreover , the population and context of the Philippines , is very different from that of the United States , which likely makes the populations hard to compare ( see [ 62 ] , [ 63 ] ) .Therefore these findings are not necessarily at odds with those of Kuzawa and colleagues [ 38 ] .There are several notable limitations to this study .Firstly , our conclusions are based on self - reports .It could be that men with higher T levels are more prone to boast their number of children , or alternatively , be more likely to include stepchildren as their own children .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.476753"}

{"text": "Personality differences between men , and cultural variation in social norms , can modify the relationships between hormones and behaviors like these .But the general assumption among many anthropologists who study the role of hormones in human fatherhood is that these behaviors represent time investments that would likely detract from a man 's ability to be an effective and attentive father and caregiver .Although there are very few available studies that have evaluated the effects of testosterone on fathering behaviors , there is preliminary evidence that lower testosterone can sensitize men to being more involved as caregivers .As we noted above , in our study we found that fathers who reported being involved in childcare had the lowest levels of evening testosterone .Perhaps more compelling evidence is reported by a study which showed that fathers with lower testosterone expressed greater sympathy towards , and a need to respond to , infant cries .Similarly , a recent study , released just this week , found that men 's testosterone decreased when they heard recorded infant cries , but only if they felt a need to nurture the upset infant .In a separate study examining hormonal changes during father - toddler interaction , Dr. Anne Storey and colleagues concluded that \" ... low baseline testosterone levels or greater testosterone decreases are associated with men being more responsive or attentive to their toddlers . \" Much more research will be needed to clarify the possible effects of lower testosterone on men 's abilities to perform as effective caregivers .However , as we see above , there is at least preliminary evidence that having high testosterone can focus a male 's attentions and energies on social activities , while low testosterone appears to improve the attention and care that men provide their own young .Both point to the potential benefits of reducing levels of the hormone as social duties shift with the onset of fatherhood .What is the cause of the decline in testosterone among fathers ?In our study we found that fathers who reported spending the most time ( 3 or more hours each day ) with their offspring had lower testosterone levels compared to other fathers who reported spending no time caring for their young .Here once again it is difficult to know what is \" cause \" and what is \" effect \" : does childcare reduce a father 's testosterone , or were fathers with lower testosterone simply more inclined to be involved caregivers ?The short answer is that we can not say for sure , but we do have some hints .Our best guess is that not only did fatherhood lead to a decline in testosterone , but interacting with a child , or some correlate of time spent with a child , influenced how far the levels dipped once men became fathers .Let us explain how we reached this tentative conclusion .Researchers had previously speculated that providing direct care might lead testosterone levels to drop in new fathers .For instance , in a study in Senegal , fathers who showed greater investment in their children , including hands - on childcare , had lower testosterone than fathers who were reported to be less invested .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.875954"}

{"text": "Testosterone was only lower among the fathers in the cultural group in which fathers are expected to be involved in offspring care - in the second group , among whom fathers typically are not involved caregivers , fathers did not have lower testosterone than non - fathers .These findings suggested that it is not simply being a father , but a committed father who spends time with his offspring , that seems to influence testosterone levels .Paralleling these findings , we published an article in 2009 that considered a cross - sectional ( \" snap shot \" ) study of relationships between fatherhood , childcare , and testosterone in the young men from Cebu .We found that fathers who identified themselves as primary caregivers to their children had lower testosterone compared to fathers who did not identify themselves as caregivers .Taken together , these studies set the stage for us to consider in greater detail in our new study in PNAS whether the amount of time that a man spends in childcare relates to his testosterone levels .In our new study , we found that men who reported spending more time in childcare each day had the lowest testosterone levels in 2009 .As with examples above , there are several possible interpretations of this finding that we had to consider .In fact , as we reported in the study , we did not find this - the amount of time a man spent in childcare in 2009 was unrelated to his baseline testosterone levels .Based upon the finding , we think it unlikely that low testosterone before men were fathers led to more childcare .Instead our best guess is that childcare , or some behavior or activity that is associated with childcare , somehow lowered the testosterone levels of highly - involved fathers in our sample .It is important to note that several recent experimental studies ( here and here ) , including our own , have failed to find that testosterone drops immediately in fathers after they interact with their children .For instance , in a recent study of 42 fathers in our study , we looked at hormone levels before and 30 and 60 minutes after they interacted with their offspring .Testosterone levels were stable across this period .This could indicate that interacting with a child does not lead to a drop in testosterone .However it could also indicate that we did not measure men over a long enough period of interaction to see a biological response .For instance , a father 's body might only \" reset \" hormone levels in response to more extended periods of interaction , such as over weeks or months .That is , was the intensity and number of hours spent in childcare influenced by the drop in testosterone experienced by new fathers , rather than vice versa ?Addressing these various possibilities will require new studies with more fine - grained data on testosterone and paternal care as fathers engage with their newborn babies in the weeks and months after birth .We look forward to seeing what future studies reveal !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.00302"}

{"text": "Thus , many biologists and anthropologists , including our research team , have assumed for some time that fatherhood likely lowers a man 's testosterone levels , as many of the past studies suggested that men likely conform to the pattern seen in other species with paternal care .However , this evidence , although fascinating , did not allow definitive conclusions to be reached about whether fatherhood reduced a man 's testosterone levels .This was because these studies were \" cross - sectional \" , meaning that they only measured fatherhood status and hormones as a single snapshot during one visit and interview .Had the act of becoming fathers reduced these men 's testosterone ?Or alternatively , were the men who had low testosterone to begin with simply more likely to have become fathers ?Both scenarios could explain these findings equally well , and so the matter remained unsettled .What we found in our new study .As noted above , when we first measured testosterone among the men in our study in 2005 we found that fathers had lower testosterone levels than the men who were single at that time .What makes our new study unique is that we measured these same men a second time about 5 years later .Importantly , because the men were quite young , many of them became fathers for the first time during this 5 year period , which allowed us to test whether new fathers experienced a greater drop in their hormone levels compared to men who remained single and childless .We found that the single men who ended up being partnered fathers 5 years later had higher testosterone when the study began .This is important , because it allowed us to rule out the other possible interpretation of our data - that men with low testosterone were simply more likely to become fathers .That was clearly not the case in our sample .We also found that , once these men became fathers , their testosterone levels went down substantially , and more dramatically than other groups of men .In fact , most of the men in the sample experienced some decline in testosterone during this 5 year period .Testosterone levels tend to peak in early adulthood and then gradually decline with age , so this was expected .But the new fathers experienced much greater declines than would be expected based upon age alone .Because researchers had previously speculated that the act of providing direct care of offspring might cause a decline in testosterone ( see for instance here and here ) , we made sure to ask men in 2009 about the amount time they spent in childcare each day .We found that men who reported spending more time in childcare also had the lowest testosterone levels in 2009 , which provided additional support for this hypothesis .There were other nuances to our findings , some of which we were surprised to see .For instance , although all fathers as a group had comparatively greater drops in their testosterone across the 5 years of the study , the hormonal drop was much larger among men who had newborn babies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.661583"}

Total testosterone levels of 250 - 400 ng / dL are considered borderline low , and may have functional consequences .However , testosterone levels depend on age ; older men have lower normal levels than younger men .When diagnosing endocrine problems it is important to look not just at absolute levels of specific hormones , but also at the balance between them .For example , if a man begins to convert more testosterone to estrogen , his androgen / estrogen ratio will shift and he may begin to experience \" feminizing \" symptoms such as breast growth , even if his testosterone remains within the statistically normal range .Also , a testosterone level within the normal range may be inadequate for a given individual if his usual level is higher .Some experts recommend getting a baseline testosterone measurement soon after HIV is diagnosed , against which later measurements may be compared .Hypogonadal men can be treated with supplemental testosterone or synthetic androgens .Testosterone may be administered in several forms .Testosterone cypionate or enanthate are injected intramuscularly , usually every 2 - 4 weeks .While this is the least expensive method , cyclical injections provide fluctuating blood levels of the hormone , peaking soon after administration and decreasing over time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.784187"}

{"text": "Depressed parents tend to exhibit negative emotions and helplessness , which can influence their interactions with the infant .For instance , depressed mothers exhibit more irritability , apathy , and hostility to their infants .58 Remarkably , parenting styles of depressed fathers have not yet been studied in great detail .Some findings suggest the link between irresponsive and unaffectionate parenting of both mothers and fathers make infants and the development of insecure attachments .59 An insecure attachment between a depressed mother and her child can cause the child to develop emotional and behavioral problems as well as increase the risk of psychopathology .58 Similarly , one might expect that a father who experienced PPD might fail to build a secure attachment with his infant child , which in turn may have similar negative effects on the infant 's development .The effects of the paternal PPD on an infant seem to interact with maternal mood and may indeed be long - term .A recent study found that children with fathers experiencing postpartum depression tend to exhibit greater behavioral problems , such as conduct problems or hyperactivity .6 Such negative impacts of paternal PPD on behavioral regulation were found to be stronger among boys than girls . 6In another study , paternal depression during the first year postpartum was shown to aggravate the negative impact of maternal depression on children 's development only when a father interacts with an infant for medium to high amount of time .60 Finally , in an attempt to address the long - term outcomes , one recent study showed that paternal major depression was associated with lower psychosocial functioning , elevated suicidal ideation and attempt rates in sons in young adulthood , and depression in daughters .Further , paternal PPD is a risk factor for child maltreatment and infanticide .According to the literature on maternal PPD literature , one of the greatest risk factors for a child to be a victim of maltreatment and infanticide is mother 's depression .62Thus , it is conceivable that a depressed father in an unstable mental state may expose his infant child to a greater risk of such unfortunate events .2 Based on the existing knowledge of maternal PPD , we conjecture that PPD experienced by a father might be caused by hormonal changes occurring during his partner 's pregnancy and postnatal period .We will propose several biological factors for the onset and development of the paternal PPD .First , paternal PPD might be related to changes in his testosterone level , which decreases over time during his partner 's pregnancy and postpartum period .63 , 64 Testosterone levels started to decrease at least a few months before the childbirth and maintain low levels for several months after the childbirth among most of fathers . 65Several researchers suggest that such decrease leads to lower aggression , better concentration in parenting , and stronger attachment with the infant .65 , 66 Fathers who have lower testosterone levels expressed more sympathy and need to respond when they heard infants ' cry .61 Interestingly , recent studies on older men show a significant correlation between low testosterone levels and depression .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.58328"}

{"text": "58 Similarly , one might expect that a father who experienced PPD might fail to build a secure attachment with his infant child , which in turn may have similar negative effects on the infant 's development .The effects of the paternal PPD on an infant seem to interact with maternal mood and may indeed be long - term .A recent study found that children with fathers experiencing postpartum depression tend to exhibit greater behavioral problems , such as conduct problems or hyperactivity .6 Such negative impacts of paternal PPD on behavioral regulation were found to be stronger among boys than girls . 6In another study , paternal depression during the first year postpartum was shown to aggravate the negative impact of maternal depression on children 's development only when a father interacts with an infant for medium to high amount of time .60 Finally , in an attempt to address the long - term outcomes , one recent study showed that paternal major depression was associated with lower psychosocial functioning , elevated suicidal ideation and attempt rates in sons in young adulthood , and depression in daughters .Further , paternal PPD is a risk factor for child maltreatment and infanticide .According to the literature on maternal PPD literature , one of the greatest risk factors for a child to be a victim of maltreatment and infanticide is mother 's depression .62Thus , it is conceivable that a depressed father in an unstable mental state may expose his infant child to a greater risk of such unfortunate events .2 Based on the existing knowledge of maternal PPD , we conjecture that PPD experienced by a father might be caused by hormonal changes occurring during his partner 's pregnancy and postnatal period .We will propose several biological factors for the onset and development of the paternal PPD .First , paternal PPD might be related to changes in his testosterone level , which decreases over time during his partner 's pregnancy and postpartum period .63 , 64 Testosterone levels started to decrease at least a few months before the childbirth and maintain low levels for several months after the childbirth among most of fathers . 65Several researchers suggest that such decrease leads to lower aggression , better concentration in parenting , and stronger attachment with the infant .65 , 66 Fathers who have lower testosterone levels expressed more sympathy and need to respond when they heard infants ' cry .61 Interestingly , recent studies on older men show a significant correlation between low testosterone levels and depression .67 Men aged 45 to 60 who are clinically depressed also exhibit lower testosterone levels than normal men .Further studies are needed to show whether such correlations can be extrapolated to all fathers during the postpartum period and if they might be part of an excessive adjustment .If proven , testosterone levels might contribute to a biological explanation of paternal PPD and even point toward a means of testing and prevention .Second , paternal PPD might be related to lower levels of estrogen .Among men , the estrogen level begins to increase during the last month of his partner 's pregnancy until the early postpartum period .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.87752"}

{"text": "81The relative slow development of attachment might be related to the father 's feeling of helplessness and depression for the first few postpartum months .One of the factors that may make parenting difficult for many fathers is the absence of a good role model .In recent years , we see a dramatic increase in society 's expectation for fathers to have greater involvement in parenting , yet many fathers report that they did not learn appropriate parenting skills from their own fathers or other male seniors .82 Competence in parenting among fathers is significantly associated with the father 's sense of mastery in his role and family functioning .83 The lack of understanding of what is expected of a father might cause anxiety , especially the first - time fathers , and lead to a greater risk of paternal PPD .Lack of rewards in parenting might also contribute to the development of paternal PPD .Fathers report positive feedbacks , such as smiles from their infants , as the most significant reward in parenting .80 However , a father 's lack of experience in parenting and fewer hours with an infant may tend to make interactions more distressing for the infant .Fathers also report being isolated from mother - infant bonding and feeling jealous about their partners ' dominance in spending intimate time with babies , especially through breastfeeding .3 Interestingly , fathers may report feelings of jealousy toward their babies because the babies occupy a great amount of their partner 's attention .Furthermore , the stress from the relationship with their partners might influence fathers ' moods during the postpartum period .Because of sudden life changes , marital relationships often are threatened during the early postnatal period time .80 Fathers report increased dissatisfaction with their relationships with their partners , including lack of intimacy 85 and the partner 's loss of interest in sexual relationship .30 Some studies found that the quality of relationship not only with their partners but also with their in - laws , especially mothers - in - law , can influence fathers ' involvement in parenting .In marital relationships , fathers ' parenting stress during the postpartum period can be further complicated by the differences in and perceptions of distinct gender roles of fathers and mothers .The emphasis on the man 's role as the breadwinner may be increased due to the increased financial burdens after the birth of the child , and , in turn , may prevent fathers from being more involved in parenting .A greater feeling of failure in performance in both work and sex as a part of the emphasized male gender role is significantly related to psychological distress among fathers .For fathers , different types of support may ease the transition process to fatherhood during the postpartum period .The most effective supports likely come from their partners because paternal PPD is closely related to partners ' mental health and their relationship with the fathers .More encouragement from a mother and active discussion in each couple as they await and prepare for their baby may help the father 's involvement in parenting and ease the stress as a new father .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.1247"}

{"text": "Starting a new family can be a wonderful yet stressful experience .Newborns , and even older babies , can seem mysterious and taking care of them may be a little scary .Fortunately , babies are born with the skills and desire to tell parents what they need .In this blog , experienced moms ( who happen to be experts ) will help parents understand why babies behave the way they do and share tips to help parents cope with the ups and downs of this new and exciting time of life .In this extended series of posts , we 've looked closely at the importance of parents ' relationships in babies lives .We 've talked about the changes that new babies bring to couples ' lives and how dads experience the transition .To end this series , we 'll take a look at women 's experiences in becoming mothers .Given that there are literally hundreds of studies about moms , we ca n't possibly do a good job in covering them all .Instead , we 'll focus on some of the most common key findings .The Realities of Recovery .While many mothers in the studies learned about childbirth by taking classes or asking questions , few moms were ready for those first few days home from the hospital .Muscles ache , stitches hurt , exhaustion sets in , and going to the bathroom becomes something to dread .Some moms are also dealing with nausea , incision pain , nasty headaches , and wild mood swings .Do n't be surprised if you feel very emotional during those first few days , it is common for new moms to feel that way , but if you feel out of control of those emotions , you should talk to your doctor .Feeling the Weight of Responsibility .Many new moms feel that they are responsible for the bulk of the baby care and still expected to meet everyone else 's needs too - partners , other kids , friends , family and pets !The weight of all that responsibility can be overwhelming .It is interesting that many of the moms in the studies asked their health care providers how to manage all the responsibility rather than how to get more support .Secrets readers know that we think all moms should ask for help from family and friends so that they can get the time they need for their own physical recovery and to connect with their babies .Even the most independent and organized mom ca n't multitask enough to make those exhausting first few weeks easy ; moms need help .It would be better for moms to use their organizational abilities to make a nice chore chart to share with helpful friends and family .These days , so many moms think they 'll be able to go back to their regular routines in a short time - unfortunately , babies ca n't cooperate with any of moms ' plans until they are older .Dealing with the Fear .Babies are so tiny and they look so fragile , many mothers are worried that they 'll make a mistake and somehow hurt their babies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.98046"}
{"text": "Being prepared and having realistic expectations will help you deal with the inevitable challenges that come with traveling with children .Good luck !Let us know if you have some great tips of your own to share .Next time : We 'll answer another reader 's question .All of us here at the UC Davis Human Lactation Center would like to send our best wishes to all of our readers who serve to promote , protect , and support breastfeeding mothers .This week is designated as World Breastfeeding Week ( this always makes my son laugh ) to celebrate all the work that is going on to assist mothers who have made the decision to breastfeed their babies .Of course , we also congratulate the moms who have ever breastfed or are breastfeeding !We 'll be back next week with a slight detour in our planned posts .We 're going to pass along some tips for moms or dads who must deal with the challenges of airline travel on their own with their babies .At what age do babies usually begin pretend / imaginary play ?Answer : Research shows that pretend play begins between 12 and 18 months , although many experts agree that it is usually closer to 18 months .When pretend play begins , it can be hard to distinguish between imagination and imitation .For example , if a 12-month - old picks up a cup and puts it to her mouth , she could just be imitating what she knows others do with cups , rather than really imagining that she 's drinking .True of False : Recent research shows that babies and young children can not differentiate between reality and fantasy ?Answer : False .Although early psychologists believed that young children were unable to tell the difference between real and imaginary , more recent research indicates that even very young children can tell the difference .Similarly , it used to be believed that young children spend so much time pretending because their brains are immature , but experts can now explain that the opposite is true .True or False : Outgoing children are more likely to have imaginary friends than children who are shy ?Answer : True .In addition , only children and older siblings are more likely to have imaginary friends than are younger siblings .Although having imaginary friends seems strange to most adults , it is very common and beneficial for young children .For example , children with imaginary friends have been shown to be better at predicting the feelings of others compared to children without imaginary friends .How should babies be put down to sleep ?Answer : B. Babies should always be put down to sleep on their backs .Putting babies down to sleep on their backs helps reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ( SIDS ) and promotes brain development by increasing the amount of time spent dreaming .When babies are on their backs , they are more likely to wake up if they are having trouble breathing .Once your baby is able to roll over on his own , it is ok to leave him on his tummy if he rolls over in the night .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.996414"}

{"text": "In animals , there is a direct relationship between testosterone and spatial ability - for humans , that 's not the case .In fact , it was hard for scientists to study testosterone 's impact in humans at all until researchers discovered that a high \" 2D4D \" digit ratio - a ring finger longer than the index finger - is linked to high exposure to prenatal testosterone .In women , who as a rule do n't receive as much exposure , ring and index fingers are often equal in length , while in males the ring finger tends to be longer .Scientists at the University of Giessen in Germany used the association to correlate mathematical and spatial skill with pre - birth testosterone levels .It was already known that men outscore women on spatial and numerical tests overall .But last year in the journal Intelligence , the German scientists reported that women with a \" male - like \" finger ratio ( and therefore higher levels of prenatal testosterone ) scored better than those whose wedding finger was shorter - and they also outperformed the men on the numerical tests .While prenatal testosterone enhances performance of spatial tasks , the relationship is complex and varies from skill to skill .Their findings , published last year in the Journal of Biological Psychology , show that the exclusive predictor for mental rotation ability is gender , with men beating women .Because testosterone level played no role whatsoever , the researchers theorize that the advantage comes from more exposure to the task , and thus , more practice .Finger ratio alone , on the other ( ahem ) hand , predicted targeting and figure - disembedding performance .For figure disembedding , the more prenatal testosterone , the better the performance .But for targeting , the level of prenatal testosterone helped only to a degree .In fact , the relationship was what researchers called \" curvilinear\"-the best performance required a highly favorable level of prenatal testosterone .Too much or too little , and the skill fell off .This could explain why men excel overall in targeting but also why some women may make better sharp - shooters or pilots than many men .The picture is also complex for free - flowing testosterone in adulthood .Instead of equating high - T with spatial skills , the relationship is reversed .It turns out that lower testosterone signals greater skill , University of Cincinnati psychologist Julie Yonker reported in the journal Cortex in 2006 .The results show just how complex the interactions are .In both men and women , excess testosterone is converted to estradiol , a form of estrogen .Studies of women in their childbearing years have found that visual - spatial performance declines during ovulation , when estrogen levels are highest , and is enhanced during menstruation , when estrogen is low .\" We infer that estradiol binds to the brain receptors directing visuospatial tasks , hindering performance , \" Yonker states .Bottom line : We 've got to get away from the idea of \" female \" brains and \" male \" brains and start thinking in terms of high- and low - testosterone and estrogen brains to understand how spatial skills develop .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.95864"}
{"text": "However , our single measurements of saliva do not introduce bias , but merely reduce the reliability of our biomarker measures and thereby limit our ability to detect relationships between hormones as well as with other variables .The relatively modest R - squared values of our regression models would also be expected to increase with greater measurement reliability .That said , the effect sizes ( \u03b2 coefficients ) for our significant regression models are sufficiently large to suggest that our results are biologically meaningful [ 6 ] .The impact of low measurement reliability in our study was partially compensated for by the fact that we collected saliva samples at standardized times in a sample of men that exceeds the size of most prior studies of human male socioendocrinology .In summary , our study is the first to test for relationships between cosleeping and paternal physiology , showing that fathers who slept near their children on the same surface had lower evening T and greater diurnal declines in T compared to fathers who slept separately from their children .In addition , we showed that fathers ' T might respond differently as children age based on how families sleep , as same surface cosleeping fathers maintained lower T regardless of whether they were fathers to infants whereas solitary sleeping fathers with older children had higher T. These results are generally consistent with the idea that human paternal physiology has an evolved capacity to respond to childcare and direct contact with children [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 38 ] .Future studies are needed to clarify whether differential effects of cosleeping versus solitary sleeping on men 's T might influence their effectiveness as caregivers and potentially affect their children 's development .Acknowledgments .Linda Adair played a central role in designing and implementing the CLHNS survey from which a portion of these data and samples were obtained .Jeffrey Huang helped with lab work .Ben Trumble and Michael Clements provided helpful feedback .We thank the Office of Population Studies , University of San Carlos , Cebu , Philippines , for their role in study design and data , and the Filipino participants , who generously provided their time for this study .Author Contributions .Conceived and designed the experiments : LTG SSA TWM CWK .Performed the experiments : LTG SSA TWM CWK .Analyzed the data : LTG JJM CWK .Contributed reagents / materials / analysis tools : TWM CWK .Wrote the paper : LTG JJM SSA TWM CWK .Wingfield JC , Hegner RE , Ball GF , Duffy AM ( 1990 )The ' challenge hypothesis ' : Theoretical implications for patterns of testosterone secretion , mating systems , and breeding strategies .Am Nat 136 : 829 - 846 .doi : 10.1086/285134 .Ellison PT ( 2001 )On Fertile Ground : A Natural History of Human Reproduction .Cambridge , Mass. : Harvard University Press . 346 p. .Salvador A , Suay F , Gonzalez - Bono E , Serrano MA ( 2003 )Anticipatory cortisol , testosterone and psychological responses to judo competition in young men .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.09442"}
{"text": "Thus , though we can not distinguish the specific forms of same surface cosleeping in this sample , it most likely involved fathers sleeping with their partners and child(ren ) on various kinds of mats , thin mattresses , or blankets on the floor of their homes .In American and many European societies , same surface cosleeping is a controversial practice .Certain medical and public health organizations argue that it poses a risk to child health under all circumstances [ 68 ] - [ 71 ] .We also found a statistical trend for cosleeping fathers to be less likely to have sex with their partners on a weekly basis compared to solitary sleeping fathers .The extent to which this might be disruptive to marital cohesion in this cultural setting is presently unclear but warrants exploration in future studies .Here we document similar findings in relationship to familial sleeping practices .Among men who transitioned from being non - fathers at baseline to being new fathers at follow - up , baseline T did not predict whether they coslept or slept separately from their children at follow - up .We also found that cosleeping fathers had a significantly greater longitudinal decline in PM T compared to solitary sleeping fathers , whose PM T increased , on average , between baseline and follow - up .Together these findings are suggestive that the lower evening T among same surface cosleeping fathers resulted from these fathers sleeping in close proximity to their children at night .Thus , it is possible that decreases in paternal T associated with cosleeping could have beneficial implications for children .Thus , though it remains speculative at this juncture , lower T could amplify the beneficial effects of daytime paternal care and nighttime cosleeping , facilitating and/or enhancing fathers ' responses to their children in those contexts , thereby contributing to better child health and development outcomes .It is also plausible that same surface cosleeping fathers have lower T as a result of sleep disruption that is not experienced by solitary sleeping fathers .While it remains to be seen whether similar polysomnographic - observed arousal patterns translate to fathers , laboratory studies have shown that extreme methods of sleep fragmentation , i.e. waking men up every 20 minutes throughout the night , lead to reduced T production [ 80 ] .Further research is needed , generally , to assess causal relationships between naturalistic arousal patterns and men 's T and , specifically , in the context of familial sleeping arrangements .Fathers who practiced same surface cosleeping also showed a significantly greater diurnal decline in T from waking ( AM ) to evening ( PM ) compared to the decline seen in solitary sleeping fathers .It is noteworthy that while AM T did not differ by sleeping arrangement both the diurnal decline and PM T did .The physiological pathways through which this delayed effect might be possible are not well understood .It seems likely the process would be mitigated via the hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal ( HPG ) axis , rather than through alternative physiological pathways that might rapidly affect circulating unbound T [ 81 ] - [ 84 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.11038"}

's ( 2000 ) data demonstrating an acute suppressive effect of infant cues on paternal testosterone production .Consequently , such fathers are expected to exhibit a more pronounced diurnal decline in testosterone than fathers of older children ( e.g. Gray et al .2002 ) .Accordingly , Hadza , but not Datoga , fathers are predicted to show a correlation between the age of the youngest child and the relative decrease in testosterone levels from morning to evening .Material and methods .In most western populations , free testosterone levels peak during young adulthood and decline steadily thereafter with age ( Vermeulen et al .1999 ) .By contrast , in many non - western populations , men exhibit comparatively lower testosterone levels in early adulthood , and thereafter show little or no reduction ( Ellison et al .2002 ) .Eighty Datoga participants between the ages of 18 and 59 were recruited by word of mouth in and around the villages of Mangola and Matala , along Lake Eyasi , during August 2003 .Interviews were conducted either in Kiswahili , by R.B. and M.N.M. , or in Kidatoga , with the assistance of an experienced Datoga field assistant .Questions focused on men 's ages , and their marital and reproductive histories .Thirty - two men in the sample had no children and , of those , 25 had no wife .Most young men knew their date of birth ; for older men , this was estimated with reference to major political and social events ( e.g. Tanzanian Independence 1961 ) , and in relation to known ages of other men .Anthropometric data included measures of height and weight , together with body fat estimates from a bioelectrical impedance scale ( Tanita BF522 ) .BMI was calculated as weight ( kg)/height 2 ( m 2 ) .Twenty - seven Hadza participants between the ages of 17 and 51 were recruited in the Sipunga area , east of Lake Eyasi , during January 2004 .Collection of saliva samples was coordinated by R.B.

{"text": "\u00a9 2014 American Association for the Advancement of Science .THAT health and beauty are linked is not in doubt .But it comes as something of a surprise that who is perceived as beautiful depends not only on the health of the person in question but also on the average level of health in the place where she lives .Ms Marcinkowska came to this conclusion by showing nearly 2,000 men from 28 countries various versions of the same female faces , modified to look less or more feminine , and thus reflect the effects of different levels of oestrogen and testosterone .Oestrogen promotes features , such as large eyes and full lips , that are characteristically feminine .Testosterone promotes masculine features , such as wide faces and strong chins .As the chart shows , the correlation is remarkable - and statistical analysis shows it is unconnected with a country 's wealth or its ratio of men to women and thus the amount of choice available to men .The cause , though , is unclear .Previous studies have shown that women with feminine features are more fertile .A man 's preference for them is thus likely to enhance his reproductive success .Ms Marcinkowska speculates that testosterone - induced behavioural characteristics like dominance , which might be expected to correlate with masculine - looking faces even in women ( they certainly do in men ) , help in the competition for resources needed to sustain children once they are born .But why that should be particularly important in an unhealthy country is unclear .The findings were presented today by Rhonda Voskuhl , M.D. , from the University of California , Los Angeles , at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in Philadelphia .The study was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ( NINDS ) , part of the National Institutes of Health ; and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society .MS is an autoimmune disorder in which immune cells break down myelin , a protective covering that wraps around nerve cells .Loss of myelin results in pain , movement and balance problems as well as changes in cognitive ability .RRMS is the most common form of the disorder .Patients with RRMS experience relapses , or flare - ups , of neurological symptoms , followed by recovery periods during which the symptoms improve .The hormone oxytocin appears to increase social behaviors in newborn rhesus monkeys , according to a study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health , the University of Parma in Italy , and the University of Massachusetts , Amherst .The findings indicate that oxytocin is a promising candidate for new treatments for developmental disorders affecting social skills and bonding .Oxytocin , a hormone produced by the pituitary gland , is involved in labor and birth and in the production of breast milk .Studies have shown that oxytocin also plays a role in parental bonding , mating , and in social dynamics .Because of its possible involvement in social encounters , many researchers have suggested that oxytocin might be useful as a treatment for conditions affecting social behaviors , such as autism spectrum disorders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.21515"}
{"text": "Thus , we predict that the findings that we report for this population will be broadly - applicable to other global populations with similar models of paternal involvement .In addition , there were good practical reasons to conduct the study in this population .Our study required that almost 1000 men were interviewed and had samples collected for hormone analysis at two times that were years apart - before and after many were fathers .As you might imagine , this was no small undertaking !The study has been run \" on the ground \" since its inception by the many scholars and researchers at the University of San Carlos Office of Population Studies Foundation , in Cebu City , where one of us serves as Director ( AF ) .The Cebu Study is known as a \" birth cohort \" because the participants were first enrolled when their mothers were pregnant with them in 1983 - 84 , and it has since followed each of these offspring from birth to the present as they have grown into young adults .It was this ongoing study , which was already following a large group of young adults , that allowed us to test how becoming a new father might influence a man 's testosterone levels .A few final observations .It has recently become clear to anthropologists that humans reproduce using a strategy of \" cooperative breeding , \" meaning that during human evolution it was not just mothers alone , but a larger , flexible social group that helped mothers raise their offspring .As anthropologists have developed this model , there has been much discussion and debate about who would have been involved as caregivers .Some have argued that grandmothers and other female kin were likely key providers of care who assisted mothers with childrearing duties , with others noting that older siblings are often important as caregivers of younger siblings .Although there is little question that parenting roles vary a great deal across cultures , fathers were likely in a good position to cooperate with mothers to raise their young under many circumstances during human evolution .Our study lends support to this idea , because it confirms that human male biology has an ability to respond as childcare duties emerge with the transition to fatherhood .We suggest that this built - in responsivity in male biology likely evolved , in part , because the survival and well - being of children were improved if fathers were highly invested in their partners and offspring .Fathers have been shown to have lower levels of testosterone in many societies , and our study simply confirms that this is likely a result of fatherhood leading to a decline in the hormone .Because paternal care is not present in the living primates most closely - related to humans ( chimpanzees and gorillas ) , it seems likely that this biological capacity appeared sometime more recently during human evolution in conjunction with the unique way that we raise our offspring .These biological changes have likely been experienced by countless generations of human fathers , for hundreds of thousands of years if not more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.42465"}

Phillips at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons discovered the answer while conducting a cross - sectional study of 55 men who were undergoing coronary angiography .At the time of the angiography , none of these men had ever had a heart attack or stroke .When serum testosterone levels from these men were analyzed , they revealed that as testosterone levels decreased , the degree of arterial occlusion increased .Phillips observed that low testosterone levels were associated with several risk factors for heart attack such as high insulin levels , abnormal glucose metabolism , low levels of HDL cholesterol and high blood pressure .Moreover , he further proposed that the converse was also true : testosterone protects against heart disease in men .The research continues .Since Dr. Phillips published his findings , an enormous body of research has gone on to confirm the cardiovascular benefits of testosterone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.55888"}

{"text": "Had the act of becoming fathers reduced these men 's testosterone ?Or alternatively , were the men who had low testosterone to begin with simply more likely to have become fathers ?Both scenarios could explain these findings equally well , and so the matter remained unsettled .What we found in our new study .As noted above , when we first measured testosterone among the men in our study in 2005 we found that fathers had lower testosterone levels than the men who were single at that time .What makes our new study unique is that we measured these same men a second time about 5 years later .Importantly , because the men were quite young , many of them became fathers for the first time during this 5 year period , which allowed us to test whether new fathers experienced a greater drop in their hormone levels compared to men who remained single and childless .We found that the single men who ended up being partnered fathers 5 years later had higher testosterone when the study began .This is important , because it allowed us to rule out the other possible interpretation of our data - that men with low testosterone were simply more likely to become fathers .That was clearly not the case in our sample .We also found that , once these men became fathers , their testosterone levels went down substantially , and more dramatically than other groups of men .In fact , most of the men in the sample experienced some decline in testosterone during this 5 year period .Testosterone levels tend to peak in early adulthood and then gradually decline with age , so this was expected .But the new fathers experienced much greater declines than would be expected based upon age alone .Because researchers had previously speculated that the act of providing direct care of offspring might cause a decline in testosterone ( see for instance here and here ) , we made sure to ask men in 2009 about the amount time they spent in childcare each day .We found that men who reported spending more time in childcare also had the lowest testosterone levels in 2009 , which provided additional support for this hypothesis .There were other nuances to our findings , some of which we were surprised to see .For instance , although all fathers as a group had comparatively greater drops in their testosterone across the 5 years of the study , the hormonal drop was much larger among men who had newborn babies .In these men , testosterone levels were about half their former pre - fatherhood levels measured in 2005 .When we looked at men whose youngest child was older than 1 month , we found that their testosterone drop was less than in this group of men with newborns .These findings generated a great deal of media and scientific attention .They are the first demonstration in humans that fatherhood seems to drive down a man 's testosterone , rather than the other way around .Our data suggest that the drop in testosterone may be especially dramatic soon after birth but then rebounds partially afterwards .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.86485"}

{"text": "Our cross - cultural data support this idea by showing that , among the Hadza , a group exhibiting high levels of paternal involvement , men caring for offspring maintain lower levels of testosterone than men who are not engaged in such care .By contrast , Datoga fathers , who exhibit low levels of paternal involvement , maintained levels of testosterone similar to those of non - fathers .To our knowledge , this is the first demonstration that increased levels of parental care are directly associated with low testosterone in fathers .Among foragers such as the Hadza , when they are not out of camp foraging , men are often near their children , sometimes babysitting weanlings while mothers forage .Because men sleep together with their wives and children , they have direct physical contact with younger children throughout the night .This sort of intimacy is the likely context within which human paternal investment evolved .The increased rates of polygyny and diminished paternal involvement of pastoralists such as the Datoga are probably driven by wealth inequalities among men in the form of cattle ownership that would have been absent prior to the domestication of herd animals .The role of fathers in Hadza childrearing is often overlooked , owing to the focus on grandmothering in this group ( Hawkes et al .1997 ) .However , in Marlowe 's ( 2005 ) data , genetic fathers held their children and interacted with their children twice as much as maternal grandmothers .The intensity of care by genetic fathers may be responsible for the relatively robust effects reported here , with morning testosterone in fathers 30 per cent lower and evening levels almost 50 per cent lower than non - fathers .By contrast , in several North American studies , testosterone differences between fathers and non - fathers were less prominent , and in some cases - particularly among morning samples - non - significant ( Berg & Wynne - Edwards 2001 ; Gray et al .2002 , 2004 a , b ) .A number of studies have reported that evening testosterone levels in humans and chimpanzees show stronger correlates with behavioural measures than do morning samples ( Worthman & Konner 1987 ; Berg & Wynne - Edwards 2001 ; Gray et al .2002 ; Muller & Wrangham 2004 ) .This pattern may be widespread because morning testosterone levels reflect physiology during sleep , whereas evening samples are influenced by the cumulative outcomes of diurnal social interactions .In the present study , we found significant differences between fathers and non - fathers in both morning and evening samples , but , in evening samples , the magnitude of the disparity was greater and the p -value lower .Evidence for a suppressive effect of interactions with offspring on testosterone comes from the correlation between the age of the youngest child and the relative diurnal decline in testosterone observed in Hadza fathers .Although the sample size is small , the data support the idea that , within populations , the level of direct paternal involvement with offspring affects short - term testosterone production , and that this phenomenon is not limited to a brief period following parturition ( Storey et al .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.54944"}

{"text": "We 'll be back next week with a slight detour in our planned posts .We 're going to pass along some tips for moms or dads who must deal with the challenges of airline travel on their own with their babies .At what age do babies usually begin pretend / imaginary play ?Answer : Research shows that pretend play begins between 12 and 18 months , although many experts agree that it is usually closer to 18 months .When pretend play begins , it can be hard to distinguish between imagination and imitation .For example , if a 12-month - old picks up a cup and puts it to her mouth , she could just be imitating what she knows others do with cups , rather than really imagining that she 's drinking .True of False : Recent research shows that babies and young children can not differentiate between reality and fantasy ?Answer : False .Although early psychologists believed that young children were unable to tell the difference between real and imaginary , more recent research indicates that even very young children can tell the difference .Similarly , it used to be believed that young children spend so much time pretending because their brains are immature , but experts can now explain that the opposite is true .True or False : Outgoing children are more likely to have imaginary friends than children who are shy ?Answer : True .In addition , only children and older siblings are more likely to have imaginary friends than are younger siblings .Although having imaginary friends seems strange to most adults , it is very common and beneficial for young children .For example , children with imaginary friends have been shown to be better at predicting the feelings of others compared to children without imaginary friends .How should babies be put down to sleep ?Answer : B. Babies should always be put down to sleep on their backs .Putting babies down to sleep on their backs helps reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ( SIDS ) and promotes brain development by increasing the amount of time spent dreaming .When babies are on their backs , they are more likely to wake up if they are having trouble breathing .Once your baby is able to roll over on his own , it is ok to leave him on his tummy if he rolls over in the night .True or False : Eye color does not change after birth ?Answer : False .Many babies are born with greyish colored eyes and the color tends to change over the first year of life .It has been suggested that almost half of young children experience lightening or darkening of eye color .If you have questions you 'd like to see included in our next quiz , please send them to us .We 'd love to hear from you !Next Time : We 'll answer a reader 's question about the risk of choking when babies are put down on the backs to sleep .Welcome !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.40439"}

{"text": "We also found preliminary evidence that the effects of having young , infant - aged ( 1 year old or less ) offspring may affect men differently based on their familial sleeping arrangements .Men who practiced same surface cosleeping had lower T regardless of whether their youngest child was an infant or older than a year when compared to solitary sleeping fathers whose youngest child was older than 1 year .These possibilities merit exploration in future longitudinal research .This analysis has limitations that warrant mentioning .First , we asked fathers only about their sleeping arrangements on the night before salivary sampling , not their habitual activities .To our knowledge , families practicing cosleeping in Cebu generally do so regularly and for the entirety of the night , at least in part because of household space constraints .This differs from a common practice in more affluent societies in which infants and young children have their own bedrooms and are brought to the parents ' room for portions of the night before being returned to their own sleeping quarters [ 87 ] - [ 89 ] .Thus , though presently there are no relevant scientific data from the Philippines available on the subject , it seems likely that men 's self - reports of their sleeping arrangements from the prior night are generally reflective of their more routine sleeping arrangements .However , there is also a chance that fathers who normally slept separately from their children might have been near them the night prior to sampling because of some extenuating circumstances , e.g. a distressed child or maternal absence .Thus , it is possible that the \" solitary sleeping \" category is mildly underrepresented , though we think it unlikely .Second , as we noted in the Methods , we collected the PM sample the night before the collection of the AM sample in order to reduce participant burden and minimize interviewer field logistics .This study design allowed us to schedule single interviewer follow - up visits to each participant to collect both tubes .Prior research suggests that salivary T measures represent relatively stable baselines for subjects [ 90 ] - [ 92 ] , which we take to be true here , particularly given our study 's sample size .We also relate the PM and AM T values to a behavioral measure ( whether men cosleep with their offspring ) that is believed to be habitual in this cultural context .Consequently , we think that this approach allows us to capture relatively stable between - individual hormonal variability based on familial sleeping patterns .However , we also realize this design differs from studies that conduct AM and PM sampling on the same day .Our approach renders the interpretation of the diurnal change in T potentially more difficult , as our calculation is not change over a single day ( see Methods ) , diverging from other studies [ e.g. 64 ] .However , if our T measurements are representative of relatively stable , day - to - day hormone levels , this issue is largely ameliorated .In total , we think it unlikely that an alternative research design , with both samples collected on the same day , would have substantially altered the results of the study or our interpretations thereof .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.42057"}

{"text": "If not , the progesterone level drops , menstruation occurs , and the cycle begins anew .Most endocrine activity is governed by a series of feedback loops involving the hypothalamus and the pituitary .When receptors in the hypothalamus sense a decreased level of a specific hormone in the blood , the gland secretes a releasing hormone that tells the pituitary to signal the appropriate subsidiary gland to ramp up its activity .Conversely , as blood levels of a hormone increase , the hypothalamus decreases production of the releasing hormone , in effect \" turning off \" the subsidiary gland .For example , when the body is under physical or emotional stress , the hypothalamus relays this information by releasing CRH into a bed of capillaries that feeds the pituitary .CRH causes the anterior pituitary to increase its production of ACTH , which in turn stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce more of the stress hormone cortisol .As cortisol levels rise , the hypothalamus senses this change and stops producing CRH .Without CRH , the pituitary stops secreting ACTH , and the lack of ACTH , in turn , shuts down production of cortisol by the adrenal glands .This negative feedback loop is called the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis .Similar regulatory pathways exist for the thyroid and the gonads .Endocrine function can go awry in several ways .The hypothalamus and/or pituitary can produce too much or too little of the hormones that stimulate the activity of other glands .Subsidiary glands may also produce too much or too little hormone , a condition known as primary gland failure .In addition , cell receptors may fail to respond appropriately to a hormone .Because hormones are involved in so many different bodily processes , it is no surprise that a systemic disease like HIV can affect endocrine function , and vice versa .The first wave of research on endocrine dysfunction in people with HIV occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s , before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) .Autopsy studies of people who died from AIDS - related conditions often revealed direct infection of endocrine glands by opportunistic pathogens such as cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , Pneumocystis carinii , or Mycobacterium avium .In addition , several drugs used to treat opportunistic illnesses ( OIs ) can contribute to endocrine dysfunction ( see table above ) .Today , it is clear that serious endocrine dysfunction occurs more often in people with AIDS or symptomatic HIV disease than in those with early - stage disease and mild immune suppression .Some endocrine disorders are associated with serious illness in general .For example , many severe systemic illnesses , including AIDS , are associated with reduced thyroid hormone production , a condition known as euthyroid sick syndrome ( meaning the thyroid gland itself is normal , but its function is impaired ) .In various studies , decreased T3 has been associated with lower CD4 cell counts , active OIs , and severe weight loss .The endocrine , nervous , and immune systems are interrelated in complex ways that are not yet fully understood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.31445"}

{"text": "As of now , we do not think there are any reasons to be concerned about the health effects of being a father .In fact , there is growing evidence that fathers tend to be healthier than non - fathers , such as was shown by this new large study published less than a week after our PNAS paper was reported .Why did we conduct this study in the Philippines ?The men in this study live in urban and rural neighborhoods in the metropolitan area surrounding Cebu City , a city of almost 3 million people , and the second largest city in the Philippines ( itself a nation of nearly 100 million ) .This is a fascinating time to study fatherhood in the Philippines , because more and more fathers are actively participating in childcare and there have been few studies of fatherhood in the country .Our research and that of others has shown that within this generation ( men currently in their 20s and 30s ) men are increasingly helping take care of their children , which is a role fewer fathers embraced in the past in Cebu and elsewhere in the Philippines .The caregiving duties that fathers in our study reported most commonly will likely sound familiar to many fathers who read this blog : watching TV , feeding and bathing , playing games , and taking their children on walks .Thus , we predict that the findings that we report for this population will be broadly - applicable to other global populations with similar models of paternal involvement .In addition , there were good practical reasons to conduct the study in this population .Our study required that almost 1000 men were interviewed and had samples collected for hormone analysis at two times that were years apart - before and after many were fathers .As you might imagine , this was no small undertaking !The study has been run \" on the ground \" since its inception by the many scholars and researchers at the University of San Carlos Office of Population Studies Foundation , in Cebu City , where one of us serves as Director ( AF ) .The Cebu Study is known as a \" birth cohort \" because the participants were first enrolled when their mothers were pregnant with them in 1983 - 84 , and it has since followed each of these offspring from birth to the present as they have grown into young adults .It was this ongoing study , which was already following a large group of young adults , that allowed us to test how becoming a new father might influence a man 's testosterone levels .A few final observations .It has recently become clear to anthropologists that humans reproduce using a strategy of \" cooperative breeding , \" meaning that during human evolution it was not just mothers alone , but a larger , flexible social group that helped mothers raise their offspring .As anthropologists have developed this model , there has been much discussion and debate about who would have been involved as caregivers .Some have argued that grandmothers and other female kin were likely key providers of care who assisted mothers with childrearing duties , with others noting that older siblings are often important as caregivers of younger siblings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.23479"}
{"text": "The major endocrine glands are the hypothalamus , pituitary , thyroid , parathyroids , adrenal glands , Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas , and the gonads ( testes in males and ovaries in females ) ; see illustration below .Other cells ( for example , in the gastrointestinal tract and the brain ) also secrete chemicals that exert endocrine effects .The Hypothalamus and Pituitary .The hypothalamus , located in the lower middle part of the brain , is the primary link between the endocrine system and the nervous system .The hypothalamus relays information about the body 's external and internal environment from the brain to other glands .The hypothalamus secretes releasing hormones that direct the pituitary to increase or decrease production of its own hormones , which in turn stimulate subsidiary glands such as the thyroid , adrenal glands , and gonads .The major hypothalamic hormones are growth hormone - releasing hormone ( GHRH ) , thyrotropin - releasing hormone ( TRH ) , corticotropin - releasing hormone ( CRH ) , gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) , and prolactin - releasing hormone ( PRH ) .The pituitary , a pea - sized gland located at the base of the brain , is often called the body 's \" master gland .\" The posterior ( rear ) portion of the pituitary secretes antidiuretic hormone ( ADH , or vasopressin ) , which helps regulate the body 's fluid balance , and oxytocin , which triggers uterine contractions during labor and the release of milk .The Thyroid and Parathyroid Glands .The thyroid , a butterfly - shaped gland located at the base of the neck , produces triiodothyronine ( T3 ) and thyroxine ( T4 ) , two hormones that regulate basal metabolic rate .These hormones increase heart rate and blood vessel dilation , affect mood and metabolism , and are necessary for reproduction ; they also play an important role in growth and development in children .Overproduction of thyroid hormones ( hyperthyroidism ) causes rapid metabolism , insomnia , anxiety , weight loss , and heat intolerance .Conversely , underproduction ( hypothyroidism ) is characterized by slow metabolism , fatigue , depression , weight gain , muscle and nerve dysfunction , and cold intolerance .The thyroid also secretes calcitonin , which helps regulate the body 's calcium and phosphorus balance .Located near the thyroid are four small parathyroid glands , which secrete parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) .Along with calcitonin , PTH helps regulate levels of calcium , which is required for proper neural transmission and muscle function .PTH increases the concentration of calcium in the blood by promoting the release of calcium from bones , decreasing calcium excretion by the kidneys , and enhancing calcium absorption in the intestines .Calcitonin , in contrast , inhibits the release of calcium from bones and increases its excretion in the urine .The Adrenal Glands .The two adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney .These glands are comprised of two parts , the medulla ( inner part ) and the cortex ( outer part ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.129105"}
