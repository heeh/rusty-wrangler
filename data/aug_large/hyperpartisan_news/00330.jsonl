{"text": "Similarly , while Donald Trump seems to have a significant lead in the Republican race , it is premature to assume he will win unless he actually performs well in Iowa and New Hampshire .Alfred J. Tuchfarber has looked at the December polls and has also demonstrated how little predictive value they have .In polls from November 2007 , taken two months before voting , Hillary Clinton was leading the Democratic race .Rudy Guiliani was leading the Republican race , with Fred Thompson also ahead of John McCain .In 2011 Herman Cain was leading the Republican race , and had left the race by the time of the Iowa caucuses .One reason for the poor predictive value of national polls is that whoever wins in Iowa and/or New Hampshire generally gets a huge boost in subsequent states .That does n't mean that the polls in Iowa are all that more meaningful as voters there typically do n't make up their minds until the last minute .Hillary Clinton was leading in the polls in Iowa and came in third place in 2008 .In late 2007 Mitt Romney was leading the polls in Iowa , and came in second to Mike Huckabee .Herman Cain was leading in Iowa as well as the national polls two months before the Iowa caucus .Polls also have limited predictive value as the pollsters do not know who will actually turn out to vote .If the Democratic caucus in Iowa is dominated by long time Democratic voters , then the polls are showing the race as very close .If those who have n't previously voted but are showing enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders turn out to vote , there could be a big victory for Sanders .The much stronger degree of support seen for Sanders in social media is very encouraging , but no guarantee of votes .It might also be helpful for Sanders that the Iowa caucuses are later this year than in the 2008 cycle , when many college students were off on vacation .Even more might turn out for Sanders in this year than had turned out for Obama .Similarly we will not know whether Donald Trump will easily win the nomination , or if a party regular will challenge him , until we see how the voters act .The above electoral map prediction from Western Illinois University has received a lot of attention , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders , for showing Sanders winning in a landslide .Some argue that we should take this seriously because the mock election model has been right in every election it was used in since 1975 .The catch is that it was only used three times since 1975 .They deserve some credit for correctly predicting victories for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford before many people had heard of Carter , and for predicting the election of Obama when many were ( as with Sanders now ) claiming he was unelectable .While I would love for this to be true , it is also very hard to accept the results in specific states , such as Sanders winning Mississippi and Georgia but losing in Hawaii and Maryland .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.06154"}

Rand Paul ( R - Ky . ) published on Time 's Web site .\" If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager , there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off , \" he wrote . \" But , I would n't have expected to be shot . \" In his piece , Paul criticized what he called the growing militarization of local police forces .\" There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace , \" he wrote , \" but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response .\" This comes as a change from what we generally expect from Republicans : .Since Richard M. Nixon made cracking down on crime a central issue of his 1968 presidential campaign , Republicans have held themselves up as the alternative to a Democratic Party they have derided as soft on issues of law and order .But an appetite for changes in the criminal justice system has been building among Republicans , many of whom believe the tough - justice approach has run its course .Mr. Paul , Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin are among those who say that the federal and state governments need to rethink the way convicts are sentenced and imprisoned , arguing that the current system is inhumane and too costly .Mr. Paul 's remarks on Thursday were similar to those of other leading conservatives who have weighed in on the events in Ferguson .\"Civil liberties must be protected , but violence is not the answer .\" Erick Erickson , a conservative writer , took to Twitter to question why the police needed to display so much firepower .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "120.729195"}
