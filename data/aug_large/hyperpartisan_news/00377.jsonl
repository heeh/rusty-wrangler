{"text": "If two - thirds of the sitting senators find the president guilty , he is removed from office .If Bill Clinton is removed , Vice - President Al Gore will automatically take over the presidency until elections in 2000 .How did it all start ?Strangely enough , not with Monica Lewinsky .Prosecutor Kenneth Starr was originally granted license to investigate the allegations that Clinton had broken the law in connection with the improper dealings of the Whitewater property company before he even became President .Monica Lewinsky gave evidence , denying any sexual relationship with the President , during the Paula Jones 's sexual - harassment lawsuit against him .Starr had picked up the possibility of Clinton committing or encouraging perjury over the Lewinsky affair in late 1997 .After Starr 's grand jury took evidence from both Lewinsky and Clinton , the Prosecutor published his report in September 1998 .A month later , the House Judiciary Committee voted to launch a congressional impeachment inquiry against Clinton .What is the House Judiciary Committee ?The House Judiciary Committee is one of over two hundred Congress committees currently in use .Because of the number of issues Congress has to deal with , committees are empowered to consider legislation , conduct hearings and investigations , and carry out other assignments as instructed by the chamber .The Judiciary Committee is one of Congress 's more important , permanent standing committees and it considers many other judicial issues apart from impeachment cases .But it will seldom attract as much attention as in the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton .The majority party holds a majority of the seats on every committee .Hence , the Judiciary Committee currently consists of 21 Republican congressmen and women and 15 Democrats .Its pro - Republican , anti - Clinton character is undisputed : chairman Henry Hyde sponsored an amendment banning the federal funding of abortions in the 1970s ; another Republican member , Bob Barr , attempted to impeach Clinton before the Lewinsky scandal broke .In impeachment cases , the judiciary committee 's role is to develop \" articles of impeachment \" ( charges ) against the President .The Senate then uses these in the final trial to decide whether the President is thrown from office .These charges stem from allegations surrounding the President that he denied the Lewinsky affair and tried to obstruct justice during the Paula Jones ' harassment case brought against him .An important precedent was set here by Walter Nixon , a Mississippi judge .He was the last US official to be impeached in 1989 , for lying to a grand jury trial over marijuana - smuggling .Republican Congressman Sensenbrenner believes this case could prove a decisive precedent .How might Clinton be cleared ?A person commits perjury in US law when they wilfully subscribes to any matter he does not believe to be true .Subornation of perjury is when a person induces another to commit perjury .It is very rare for perjury to be applied in civil cases , like the Paula Jones harassment case , because lawyers accept that lying is endemic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "36.922363"}

Bush left office in 2009 our national debt had jumped to $ 10 trillion .Because of this deal , when Barack Obama leaves office our national debt will be nearly $ 20 trillion .When the history books are written , they will say that Boehner and McConnell had the opportunity to stop the madness and put America back on a sound fiscal track , but sadly declined .What is impeachment ?Impeachment is a proceeding in which accusations are brought by a legislative or executive branch of a government against civil officials .Impeachment is the constitutional way in which the American president can be thrown out of office between elections .The president must be found guilty of high crimes - defined by the Constitution as \" Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and misdemeanours \" . \"High crimes and misdemeanours \" have traditionally meant abuses of power .A two - thirds vote of the senators present is required to convict the president after an impeachment inquiry .Punishment is limited to removal from office , although the accused can still be subject to criminal proceedings in the courts after impeachment .What are the origins of impeachment ?Impeachment existed in ancient Greece , as \" eisangelia \" .In medieval times , the English parliament developed the process as a means to exercise some measure of control over the King .The writers of the US Constitution adopted the British procedure and the unique phrase used in English parliamentary impeachments : \" Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanours \" .They modified the practice to discourage the misuse of impeachment as a tool of political advantage .However , the attempt to impeach President Andrew Johnson in 1868 clearly breached this intent and many would argue that the 1998 attempt to impeach President Clinton is similarly politically motivated .Has impeachment occurred before in American politics ?Impeachment occurs frequently at the state level of American politics .Since the adoption of the federal Constitution , all states except Oregon have adopted the practice of impeachment .In Alaska it applies only to the highest judicial officers ; in Alabama , it pertains to all officers of state .No US president has ever been dismissed after an impeachment inquiry , although Johnson and Richard Nixon came close .In 1868 , in the tumultuous years after the American Civil War , the northern - dominated Congress voted to impeach Johnson , who came from the South .Johnson survived the Senate trial by a single vote .An impeachment resolution , passed in the House by a simple majority , enables the judiciary committee to develop \" articles of impeachment \" which are , essentially , charges .This process can take several months .Then the House of Representatives votes on the articles .If approved they are passed on to the Senate , which convenes a special trial - full impeachment proceedings - to remove the president from office .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.86805"}

Res .499 , in the U.S. House of Representatives requesting that the Bush Administration provide Congress with all factual information in its possession , including phone records , relating to this leak .Protecting the functioning of our nation 's Intelligence Community , and all who serve in it , is vital to our national security and to the safety of all Americans .At this time , a resolution of inquiry is the best tool at the disposal of this House to determine how this leak occurred and who perpetrated it . H. Res .499 has been referred to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , as well as the Judiciary , International Relations , and Armed Services Committees .The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence was the first to act earlier today , albeit prematurely in my estimation .If we have learned anything from the war against terrorism , it is that our national security hinges upon human intelligence and the men and women who gather it .Before I introduced this resolution , I talked with a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and they told me I was doing the right thing .I wish all of them had been willing to stand up today for the men and women in the Intelligence Community who put their lives at risk to keep our nation safe .Congress , especially this Committee , has an oversight role .To say that Congress should not act because the Department of Justice , another agency , is investigating is like saying that if the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at wrongdoing at Enron , no Congressional inquiry is appropriate .I am severely disappointed at the lack of bipartisan cooperation on this Committee on a matter so fundamental to the national security of this country .I am disappointed that the Chairman did not even permit an open hearing to allow the public the ability to assess and judge for themselves our deliberations .This matter could have , and should have , been discussed without reference to any classified information .I must conclude that the hearing was closed to stifle debate , rather than to protect classified information .I am disappointed that he did not permit , at the least , opening statements to be on the public record .And I am disappointed that a majority of my colleagues voted yes on the motion to report H.
