{"text": "I suspect that there are very few people in Scotland , other than dyed - in - the - wool Unionists , who believe that the Vow has been , or will be , honoured .With the Vow , the Unionists offered a deal to the Scottish electorate , Devo Max or something close to it in return for a No vote .However , as soon as they got the result they wanted - quite possibly only because of the Vow - they reneged on it .In my view , that is sufficient reason to regard the No vote as invalid and to demand a new referendum - sooner rather than later .These two axes are not the only ones which might be used to classify political parties .One could attempt to rate parties on the basis of their honesty .In government , do they implement their pre - election pledges , or at least attempt to do so ?Do they act on behalf of the electorate as a whole , as they would claim , or for a small part of it ?Can their policies be influenced by MP 's own financial interests or by money , whether as political donations , lucrative directorships and consultancies , or outright bribes ?As a second axis for a graph , one could use Idealism - Opportunism .I will discuss this by describing the hypothetical end members of this scale ; any real party will show some mixture of idealism and opportunism .An entirely idealistic party would have a definite vision of the society it wished to create , and all its policies would be geared towards achieving that society .If those policies were not popular with the electorate , it would not abandon them , but would seek to persuade voters of their merits .An idealistic party might be good or bad , depending on its goals ; the Nazis had their ideals but , tragically , those ideals were evil .An idealistic party , like a religion , can inspire zeal and even fanaticism amongst its followers .This is probably why Wikipedia lists six current UK political parties with the word \" Communist \" as part of their title ; what might have been one minor party is fragmented into complete insignificance .A purely opportunistic party would have only one ideal , namely that it should form the government whenever possible , so that its leading MPs might have the chance to enjoy the prestige , perks and privileges ( legitimate or otherwise ) of ministerial office .Its policies would be chosen entirely on the basis of their likely popularity with the electorate .Blatantly obvious opportunism is unlikely to appeal to voters , or to inspire ordinary party members to go out and campaign for the party ; it would have to be disguised ( perhaps as populism ) , and hence an opportunistic party would also be a significantly dishonest one .In opposition , an opportunistic party may well decide that their failure to win the most recent election proves that the winning party had the most attractive policies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.47937"}

{"text": "The first is that it would be selfish ; there are millions of people in England who do not support the Tories and do not deserve to suffer the consequences of Tory ( or even New Labour ) government .The second reason is that I suspect that the prospects of actually achieving independence , once there is a clear majority in favour of it , may be better with a Real Labour government at Westminster .What I believe is as follows .It is very unlikely that Cameron or any other Tory Prime Minister will sign any similar agreement , knowing that this time a Yes vote is probable - if it is not probable , the Scottish Government is unlikely to want a referendum .Either the Scottish Government will be prevented from holding a new referendum , or Westminster will not recognise a Yes vote as valid .A UDI would be a scary prospect for many people , and support for one , as a last resort , is only likely to go above 50 % if there is truly massive support for independence , and a great deal of anger directed at Westminster .My guess is that , since Labour can no longer rely on Scotland returning mostly Labour MPs , a Real Labour government would be easier to deal with .Real Labour would not renew Trident , and would not have the same need to keep hold of Faslane .Real Labour is less likely to look back on the British Empire with nostalgia , and to treat Scotland as the last remnant of that Empire , as England 's last colony .The third reason to hope for a revival of Real Labour south of the border is that , should Scotland become independent , England would be a better neighbour under Real Labour than under any neo - liberal regime .It will be easier for the Scottish Government to implement socially just policies if England is doing something similar .For example , if the top rate of income tax and benefits were both significantly higher in Scotland than in England , there might be an exodus of rich people from Scotland ( for tax purposes at any rate ) and an influx of unemployed and disabled people .I am glad that Jeremy Corbyn is the new Labour leader ; I see it as an encouraging sign that the neo - liberal tide might perhaps be about to ebb .What it will mean for Scotland , and the cause of Scottish independence , I do not know , but I am cautiously optimistic that it might open up new opportunities , especially if the Tories start quarrelling amongst themselves over EU membership .In a recent radio programme , it was suggested that in the nineteenth century , while many other countries were adopting formal constitutions , people in England were so proud of Magna Carta as a sort of proto - constitution that they thought that Britain did not need anything else .The speculation prior to the election about what might have happened if the result had been a hung parliament highlights the unsatisfactory nature of the UK 's uncodified constitution , key parts of which are are mere conventions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.053"}
{"text": "It will be a sobering moment for the House of Commons .But transforming parliament must mean going much further than even our recent root and branch changes to the parliamentary allowances system .It was right to take away from MPs their ability to set and police their pay and expenses , and so self regulation has given way to statutory regulation by people independent of MPs .But we are also determined to do all that is necessary to restore trust and to ensure that all MPs , like the vast majority do already , concentrate on serving the public and not themselves .And that is why , in grave situations where financial impropriety has been proven , but where parliament itself has failed to act , we are proposing the ultimate power of recall by the people .But , in the new politics , it is also essential that MPs are accountable to their constituents and that their mandate is clear and strong .The first past the post system maintains a clear link to a member of parliament 's constituency and it has usually given governments a clear mandate to govern .The alternative vote system has the advantage of maintaining the benefit of a strong constituency link ; allowing MPs to be not simply policy makers , but also community leaders , community organisers , and thestrongest champions for neighbourhoods they know and love .But if the people decide to back the alternative vote , it also offers voters increased choice with the chance to express preferences for as many of the candidates as they wish .It means that each elected MP will have the chance to be elected with much broader support from their constituency , not just those who picked them as their first choice .In short it offers a system where the British people can , if they so choose , be more confident that their MP truly represents them , while at the same time remaining directly accountable to them .Any change will not be for the forthcoming election .I will argue and campaign for such a change .And because this is a major change in our democratic arrangements , we are today publishing the key clauses we are tabling as part of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill .That bill will have the effect of introducing the primary legislation required to hold a referendum on moving to the alternative vote system , which we intend should be held before the end of October 2011 .And in moving towards a more democratic form of election , I hope too that we can move towards making parliament itself better reflect the people it serves .When I entered parliament in 1983 , the House of Commons was an all white chamber .There were only 23 women .Just think - a chamber where 50 per cent of the population had only 3 per cent of the representation .A black woman did not speak at the Commons despatch box until late last year .That is unacceptable - and it must change .The Equality Bill is extending all - women shortlists until 2030 - and I 'm proud that already three in every five of those candidates selected for the Labour Party in seats we currently hold are women .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.183075"}

{"text": "The third problem is by far the most serious one .The presence or lack of entrenchment is a fundamental feature of constitutions .An entrenched constitution can not be altered in any way by a legislature as part of its normal business concerning ordinary statutory laws , but can only be amended by a different and more onerous procedure ...Entrenchment is an inherent feature in most codified constitutions .( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution#Entrenchment ) .In the UK , sovereignty is vested in ' the Crown in Parliament ' , which in practice means that Parliament rules supreme , and the people are subjects rather than citizens .What passes for a constitution provides only the flimsiest of protection from any government which chooses to abuse their powers .A government with a majority in both Houses of Parliament can change the constitution by passing legislation or even by amending Parliamentary standing orders .There is no requirement for changes to be approved by the electorate , or even for there to be any meaningful public consultation .The Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011 was passed quietly , with little attention from the media or public debate that I can recall , and yet it eroded democracy by decreasing the frequency of general elections .( In the period from 1979 to 2010 , the average time between general elections was less than 4 1/2 years , while now it is to be 5 years unless a government loses a no confidence vote . )I believe that , although democracy does not guarantee good government , alternative systems are worse and almost guarantee bad government .It follows that the more democracy we have , the better .In the UK , there is nowhere near as much democracy as there could be - we have the unelected Lords , and we are rarely given the opportunity to participate in an important decision through a referendum .An increase of a few months in the interval between elections may not be a major change , but it is a step in the wrong direction .A well - chosen codified constitution , which requires approval for any changes through a referendum , puts sovereignty in the hands of the electorate , and lets a country 's citizens put limits on what its government can do .It has the potential to protect democracy , although it is not infallible .The best constitution can be wrecked by a military coup or a government ruthless enough to be undeterrred by the illegality of its actions .Democracy can even betray itself , as it did in Germany in 1933 when Hitler was voted into power .I fear that the UK is slowly moving towards corporate fascism .For some time now , democracy in the UK has been ineffectual ; the occasional elections have changed little because since the Blairite takeover of the Labour party there has been little to choose beteween the only two parties with any chance of forming a government at Westminster .Perhaps Jeremy Corbyn will triumph over the Blairites , revive the fortunes of the Labour party in England , and in 2020 lead a genuinely left of centre party to victory .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.37168"}

{"text": "( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution ) .I believe that there are three major problems which arise from the uncodified nature of the UK 's constitution .The first is the inclusion within it of conventions which have somehow developed over the centuries .A convention is like a gentlemen 's agreement , or a voluntary code of conduct ; it is useful just as long as everyone involved abides by it , even if they only do so for fear of the damage to their reputation should they not do so .Constitutional conventions are not , and can not be , enforced by courts of law .The primary reason for this , according to the Supreme Court of Canada in its 1981 Patriation Reference , is that , \" They are generally in conflict with the legal rules which they postulate and the courts are bound to enforce the legal rules .\" More precisely , the conventions make certain acts , which would be permissible under a straightforward reading of the law , impermissible in practice .The court ruled that this conflict between convention and law means that no convention , no matter how well - established or universally accepted , can \" crystallize \" into law , unless the relevant parliament or legislature enacts a law or constitutional amendment codifying the convention .This principle is regarded as authoritative in a number of other jurisdictions , including the UK .( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_%28political_custom%29 ) .One significant convention is that the monarch always gives the royal assent to any bill which has been passed by Parliament .The last bill to be refused royal assent was one to arm the Scottish militia , which Queen Anne refused to sign in 1708 .Yet legally the Queen could still veto legislation by withholding assent ( with the formula \" La Reyne s'avisera \" ) .If her successor is faced with a bill which he strongly disagrees with , will he submit to the convention , or will he risk provoking a constitutional crisis by responding \" Le Roy s'avisera \" ?A second disadvantage of the UK 's uncodified constitution is that it is quite difficult to know exactly what it really is .There are some Acts of Parliament which clearly form part of the constitution , one of the most important being the Bill of Rights 1689 .The Bill of Rights lays down limits on the powers of the monarch and sets out the rights of Parliament , including the requirement for regular parliaments , free elections , and freedom of speech in Parliament .A separate but similar document , the Claim of Right Act 1689 , applies in Scotland .( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689 ) .Obviously there are other acts which might be considered as part of the constitution , such as the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011 , the numerous Representation of the People Acts and Reform Acts , and of course the infamous Acts of Union .However , even where an Act of Parliament contains some matters of constitutional importance , it may also contain provisions which are clearly not relevant to the constitution , or have been superceded by later legislation , or simply rendered obsolete by changing circumstances .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.6015"}
{"text": "The problem with the 1971 constitution was not its inability to name freedoms but in the weak provisions it created to enforce them .To the limited extent that those general freedoms had any viability under the 1971 constitution , it was due to the measured work of the country 's Supreme Constitutional Court , especially during the 1990s .Indeed , as Tamir Moustafa has argued , the court 's success in this regard ultimately led to the undermining of its work .Presumably , this court will now begin to hear claims based on the declaration .But will there even be time for a case to make its way to the court while the declaration is in force ?Indeed , by including many provisions from the 1971 constitution while excluding others , the declaration exhibits a split personality .Is it meant to provide only the bare essentials for the government to operate , or to act as a fuller constitutional document ?And what is the line between these two goals ?How did the drafters decide what to include and what to leave out ?Some provisions related to the two houses of parliament are included , for example , while many more are left unincorporated .The declaration drops virtually all details of parliamentary oversight of the cabinet as well as those governing the legislative role of parliament .The declaration is very selective in retaining other structures from Egypt 's constitutional order .The SCAF , for instance , was careful to ensure that the 1971 constitution 's provision for the National Security Council was retained , perhaps mindful that this would allow the military some voice in security affairs after it returns to the barracks .But any reference to Egypt 's regional councils was omitted .Does this mean that local councils in Egypt 's administrative districts no longer exist or that they should just continue their work , ignoring the removal of their constitutional basis ?The declaration does protect the SCAF 's transitional role as a legitimate and indeed constitutional actor .Article 56 provides a list of its duties , which include lawmaking , representing the nation at home and abroad , and appointing and dismissing ministers and the prime minister .The powers of the SCAF will last through the parliamentary elections and until a new president is elected and sworn into office .Next Steps in the Transition to Civilian Rule .The declaration adds more details about the timeframe to complete the transition beyond what was specified in the referendum .The process for electing members of both houses of parliament should begin within six months from the date of the issuance of the declaration , meaning by the end of September 2011 .While both houses contain members appointed by the president , in the case of the People 's Assembly , the declaration provides that the SCAF will act as the president in making the appointments .For the Consultative Council , the declaration does not delegate this task to the SCAF but rather states that the two - thirds of its members who are elected are sufficient to constitute the body , without waiting for the one - third that the president will appoint after presidential elections take place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.616776"}

{"text": "At 650 pages Scotland 's Future is not a light read .It stands as the Scottish Government 's manifesto for a yes vote in the independence referendum .The volume ranges from profoundly important questions relating to currency and Scotland 's membership of the European Union , right down to weather - forecasting and the future of the National Lottery .Though it is likely many copies of Scotland 's Future will be printed , it is unlikely many will be read from cover to cover .Its authors probably do not regret its length : by its very heft , the volume seeks to rebut claims that the consequences of independence have not been carefully thought through .This post considers the immediate constitutional consequences of a yes vote in light of Scotland 's Future .Its central argument will be that the timescale proposed by the Scottish Government for independence following a referendum is unrealistic , and may work against the interests of an independent Scotland .The white paper on Scotland 's Future ( the \" prospectus \" ) is silent on the subject of the regulation of magazines , newspapers , radio and television , almost as if the relevant sections had been removed .The Scottish Government has set a date for independence , should it win the referendum , giving the period from 19 September 2014 to 23 March 2016 for the completion of the transition to an independent country and a full member state of the European Union and the OECD .In terms of the regulation of sectors of the Scottish economy it is a very tight schedule .Were it to become independent , Scotland would have its own legal citizenship , and would in principle be free to define the circumstances in which that status was acquired .Scotland 's Future has added new detail concerning the content of Scotland 's citizenship law in the event of independence .The White Paper affirms that ' [ f]ree education for those able to benefit from it is a core part of Scotland 's educational tradition and the values that underpin our educational system ' ( p198 ) .In that context , it is clearly stated that the Scottish Government would ' continue to support access to higher education in Scotland for students from elsewhere in the EU in accordance with our support for student mobility across Europe ' ( p200 ) .On the previous page , however , the Government also asserts that it will ' maintain the status quo by continuing our current policy of charging fees to students from the rest of the UK to study at Scottish higher education institutions ' .It is difficult to see how these competing objectives can be reconciled under EU law .Last week , I spent two days in London , accompanying a group of Constitutional Law students on a trip to the Westminster Parliament , the Supreme Court and the Scotland Office .The trip was part of a final year research project shadowing the House of Commons Political and Constitutional Reform Committee 's Inquiry into The Constitutional Role of the Judiciary if there were a Codified Constitution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.294266"}

{"text": "Its replacement , in the form of a constitutional declaration , was announced on Facebook by Egypt 's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ( SCAF ) , the country 's interim military leadership .Almost two weeks earlier , on March 19 , voters had approved eight amendments to the suspended 1971 constitution in a referendum - with the implication that the newly amended constitution would be returned to force .With significant procedural and substantive implications , the constitutional declaration is a complicated and problematic document .Egypt 's transition from authoritarian rule is not necessarily endangered , but a more inclusive and coherent approach from the SCAF would have given Egyptians greater confidence in this crucial and still very fragile process .Recent developments surrounding the declaration 's issuance indicate that : .The constitutional declaration comes after conflicting and confusing signals from the SCAF about the transitional process , and these procedural difficulties betray an improvised and opaque way to making fundamental decisions about Egypt 's future ; .The SCAF followed an odd pattern of selecting clauses from the 1971 constitution to include in its declaration , and the result will be ambiguity in the operation of critical institutions and of constitutional protections during the transition period ; .While some steps in the transition process have been identified , along with timetables , others remain unspecified .Procedural Incoherence and Inconsistency .As it developed the constitutional declaration , the SCAF consulted some Egyptian leaders on an ad - hoc basis .The SCAF ignored calls to set up a \" presidential council \" or any formal means of bringing together various political forces to oversee the process .A \" national dialogue \" was finally initiated , but only after the constitutional declaration had already been written and was placed under the authority of Egypt 's civilian cabinet rather than the SCAF .The dialogue has therefore been unable to address constitutional issues .Egyptians were not even told who had drafted the declaration ; it was presented as a sort of gift by a patriotic military leadership dedicated to protecting Egypt and the principles of the revolution .And when criticism of the closed procedure arose , SCAF members expressed frustration and wounded pride that they did not receive the gratitude they thought they deserved .The declaration process was not merely opaque - it was also confusing and even incoherent .After voters were asked on March 19 to approve amendments to the suspended 1971 constitution - which they did - they were then told the constitution was actually void and that the \" amendments \" would become part of a new constitutional declaration .Among the amendments voters approved was the abrogation of Article 179 , dealing with terrorism and national security .Thus , the referendum itself implied that only the people , acting through the referendum process , had the power to delete a constitutional provision .But when the declaration was announced on March 30 , Egyptians found that scores of other articles not mentioned in the referendum were not included , meaning the SCAF - acting on its own and outside the process it had suggested was necessary - had effectively tossed them out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.037994"}

{"text": "Yes , in your constituency 67.19 % did not vote for the winner .But even more people did n't vote for any of the other candidates , so it 's by no means obvious that a different result would have been fairer .The Hampstead and Kilburn result gives a perfect illustration of another reason why I dislike preferential voting .Sorry , but this one will take a bit of explaining : - .If we had used AV in May 2010 , and if second preferences had been distributed according to the YouGov poll of 4 - 5 May , then Glenda Jackson very likely still would have won .However , if the election had been re - run seven weeks later , with each candidate getting the same number of first preferences , but with second preferences now distributed according to the YouGov poll of 27 - 28 June , then it 's very likely the Tory candidate would have won .I 've pointed out before that second preferences are extremely volatile ; and one of the reasons for this volatility is that a large proportion of the electorate change their second preferences according to the relationships between the various parties .The two YouGov polls I referred to show this very starkly .For example , I as a Labour voter would be very well inclined to give my second preference to the Lib Dems if I thought there was a good chance of a Labour - LD coalition .If however I thought that a vote for the Lib Dems would simply prop up the existing Tory - led coalition , I would be far less likely to put my 2 next to the Lib Dem candidate .You see the problem here ?The evidence shows that second preferences depend on a very large degree to relationships between parties , and - here 's the real crux of it - voters may have NO IDEA what those relationships are likely to be at the time they cast their vote .Second preference votes therefore become a gamble ; and I do n't think elections should be about gambling .@Ben Remember in the last election when the Lib Dem leaflet featured those wonderful bar charts pointing out how Labour had no chance here and how only the Lib Dems could kick that Tory out ?No doubt that Labour 's vote was squeezed , many left wing voters tactically voting for the Lib Dems as their best bet at kicking out the Tories .Under AV , such \" squeezing \" tactics would n't work , giving Labour a fighting chance of building support and breaking through in that constituency .But you 're right - if the majority of the voters in a constituency are right wing , AV will give a right wing result .But atleast it will allow more choice as to WHICH right wing candidate you get in your constituency - I think you 'll agree that some are preferable to others ! @Stuart You could make the same argument against any kind of vote .The issue you bring up is a lack of information about how a party will act after the election and how that affects your informed choice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.359116"}
