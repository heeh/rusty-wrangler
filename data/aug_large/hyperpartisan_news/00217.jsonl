Hillary ?At least according to Sarah Palin .Upset that Fox News host Bill O'Reilly mocked the prospect of Palin and fellow reality television star Donald Trump running for president as a \" reality show , \" Palin charged that O'Reilly is trying to undermine the conservative movement just as it prepares to take on Hillary Clinton .Perkins recently spoke with Frank Gaffne y , a fellow anti - Muslim conspiracy theorist , about the supposed rise of Sharia law in the U.S. , and unsurprisingly , Gaffney joined in on the frenzy and referred to the city as \" Dearbornistan . \"He said the \" Muslim - only \" city of Dearborn has become a \" ghetto \" that is \" too dangerous \" to enter .2 ) Marriage Equality Turns Kids Into Government Property .A group of Catholic and Protestant leaders signed a statement this week warning that the legalization of same - sex marriage will lead \" to the coercion and persecution of those who refuse to acknowledge the state 's redefinition of marriage , which is beyond the state 's competence .\" By legalizing same - sex marriage , the statement reads , \" a kind of alchemy is performed , not merely on the institution , but on human nature itself , \" since same - sex marriage apparently \" disregards the created order , threatens the common good and distorts the Gospel .\"The statement even claims that marriage equality will turn children \" in important legal respects , the property of the state .\" 1 ) Gay Demonic Energy .American Family Radio host Bryan Fischer thinks that Satan makes people gay , so of course Fischer believes that Satan is also in command of the gay rights movement .\" I do n't think you will ever find a more directly demonic energy than when you deal with the homosexual agenda , \" Fischer said this week .\" They 're vicious .They are mean .You literally are staring into virtually the unvarnished energy of Satan himself when you come up against the forces that are pushing the homosexual agenda forward .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.948166"}
{"text": "That 's typical of his ego - soaked personality that is only concerned with what advances his interests .And it is expressed frequently in his Twitter feed .Just today there were a couple of tweets that deserve some special recognition due to their grotesque nature .These tweets are emblematic of Trump 's racism and misogyny .And they both attack Fox 's Megyn Kelly , proving that his claim that she had nothing to do with why he skipped the debate was an outright lie .First there was this tweet that shows Megyn Kelly with Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal .It 's purpose is to create a negative association between Kelly and Fox News with Arab royalty , and a Muslim , as if that by itself were some mortal sin .Alwaleed is minority shareholder of 21st Century Fox , the parent corporation of Fox News .There are , however , a couple of problems with that tweet .First of all , it is a fake .Kelly was photoshopped , badly , into the picture .Another problem with it is that @BradCross4 , who originally posted the picture , is a raging and unabashed racist whose twitter account is full of repulsive bigotry .Apparently that did n't bother Trump as he retweeted it .That is something he does frequently .He recently retweeted another racist meme that made ludicrous assertions about African - American crime statistics .Then there was his retweet of an image by someone called @WhiteGenocideTM .It 's hard to pretend he did n't know what that was about .Finally , Trump 's complaint about Fox News having a business relationship with Alwaleed is hypocritical in the extreme .Trump has many such relationships with Muslims , which he often brags about .As one example Trump , bought the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan in 1988 .After suffering serious financial difficulties he was forced to sell it just seven years later at a loss of nearly 40 % to - yep - Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal .So in addition to being a huuuge hypocrite , this also reveals another example of his poor business skills .[ Update : Alwaleed replied to Trump 's tweet with one of his own saying \" Trump : You base your statements on photoshopped pics?I bailed you out twice;a 3rd time , maybe ? \"Alwaleed noted the Plaza Hotel deal where he paid off Trump 's debt .He also revealed that he bought Trump 's yacht after it had been turned over to creditors ] .The other tweet that Trump promoted today was this one that featured Megyn Kelly from an article in GQ .News Corpse reported on these photos at the time and how inappropriate they were for someone purporting to be a news professional .It not only diminished her as a journalist , but it demonstrated how Fox exploits the women they put on air as sexual objects .The problem with Trump weighing in on this is that it is blatantly hypocritical .The tweet refers to Kelly as a \" bimbo \" and , therefore , unfit to moderate a debate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.533066"}

{"text": "But within a generation or two , their family sizes were little different from those of the general population .Still , many in the West believe that Muslims are different : Not only do they have larger families than the people around them , but they sometimes have higher fertility rates than their cousins back in the home country .Moroccan women in the Netherlands , for instance , have a fertility rate of 2.9 children , while Moroccan women in Morocco have 2.4 children each .Bangladeshis in Britain have 3.0 children , while those in Bangladesh have 2.4 .So even if fertility rates at home are falling toward Western levels , relatives who have migrated to the West appear to be maintaining larger families .This , to some observers , is proof that there is a conspiracy of deliberate population growth , an invasion by reproductive means .There are two important reasons for these higher numbers .First , the Muslim immigrants who come to Europe ( though not so much to the United States or Canada ) are overwhelmingly from rural areas , where fertility rates are much higher than the national average .Around the world and throughout history , rural families have more children - often many more .These immigrants are n't just changing from one national culture to another , but from a rural to an urban culture , which is an even more shocking adjustment .But it is a shift that universally leads to smaller families .It also produces higher - than - usual levels of culture shock and insecurity - one of the key reasons why integration is slower and more difficult for some of these immigrants than it is for more urban immigrant groups .Second , the highest family - size numbers are probably wrong .Women from Muslim countries tend to give birth to the majority of their children soon after arriving in their new homelands .Because of the way total fertility rate is calculated - by averaging the recorded births across a woman 's fertile lifespan - a cluster of births will produce an exaggerated figure .We now have proof that this is occurring .A large - scale study from Germany shows that a sizable majority of immigrants from Turkey marry and have most of their children almost immediately after arrival .Studies in France show that immigrant women tend to have children during their first two years in France - an effect that , once taken into account , lowers the real French Muslim fertility rate from 2.5 children to 2.2 , barely above the native - born French rate .A similar effect is found in Sweden .This high birth rate in the early years tends to create a sense of panic among observers .It led to the rather startling observation that the most common name for baby boys in Britain is Mohammed .At the same time , members of other ethnic groups ( especially white Anglo - Saxons and black American Christians ) are now more than 50 % more likely than they were a generation before to give their children uncommon names .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "126.24471"}

{"text": "\" The text describes the campaign as an effort to integrate Muslim women into mainstream Dutch society because what do you know , it turns out that they enjoy Dutch food and Dutch activities too !This describes the integration model of the European Union , where new migrants ( and especially those from \" Third Countries \" ) should try as much as possible to emulate people in their host country .Specifically , these migrants should embrace as much as possible concepts like democracy , human rights , and homosexuality - all of which are commonly framed as lacking in migrants from Muslim countries .Open Society Foundations found this campaign to be \" refreshing , more accurate , and very much needed \" , especially because \" there is not one niqab or burqa in sight \" .While there are very few Muslim women who do wear a niqab in the Netherlands , they still exist .If they are eliminated for a poster campaign simply to show politicians that Muslim women are actually human beings , does this make a niqabi fair game for Islamophobes ?In 2012 , Al - Nisa created a new campaign called \" Do You Know Me ? \" to create positive images of Muslim women in the Netherlands .Women of other ethnicities are shown briefly in the video , but other significant Muslim communities in the Netherlands are missing : Indonesians and those of Indonesian descent , and the Surinamese .The focus on Moroccan and Turkish communities fits into the larger discourse about Muslims in the Netherlands , where \" Muslims \" are usually code for \" Moroccans \" or \" Turkish \" communities .As Liz Fekete argued in her book A Suitable Enemy , European countries maintain data and surveillance on immigrant groups and asylum - seekers in order to enforce Europe 's borders .This prevalent idea is illustrated by a recent government report by the Netherlands Institute for Social Research .Meanwhile , Muslims from backgrounds which are not deemed to pose a security concern since they are not asylum - seekers nor migrants are of no interest to the Dutch government and politicians .The report even admits that : . \" Muslims from countries such as Surinam , Indonesia and the former Yugoslavia , as well as the small group of native Dutch Muslims ( estimated at 13,000 ) are left out of consideration in this study due to a lack of research data .Al - Nisa 's campaigns are indeed a breath of fresh air with their positive images of Muslim women .While responding to political discourses is beneficial and interesting in that it shows an awareness of current debates , it also risks being reactive and risks perpetuating the discourses about who Muslims are and how they should integrate into mainstream Dutch society .It is important , as a movement of Muslim women , to find allies among all other Muslim women ( such as Indonesian women , as a start ) and other marginalised groups ( such as Eastern Europeans ) .In our attempt to show \" who Muslims are , \" we should be careful to not fall into the anti - immigrant , anti - asylum , and pro - integration lines of thinking of our host country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "138.35548"}
