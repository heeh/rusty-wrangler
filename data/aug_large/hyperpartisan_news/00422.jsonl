{"text": "Simplifying somewhat , here 's my reading of the relevant causes : Whether because of support from the state or earned income , women became much better able to support a child without a husband over the period of 1960 to 2010 .As women needed men less , the social status that working - class men enjoyed if they supported families began to disappear .Result ?Men slowly discover that the effort to win women 's attention via employment is not rewarding them the way it did for their dads and granddads , and that now only herculean efforts to make considerably more than women will give them an edge in the mating market .The male fecklessness that Murray lambasts is actually a rational male response to a changing sexual market where the rewards of female sexuality go disproportionately to charming , aloof jerks over meager beta providers .Well really , men should find employment not for women 's attention but for himself ( and to support himself of course ) .Men and women should do things for themselves and not center everything on attracting the opposite sex .At least ideally .What you fail to see is you my dear is women demoralize men when they are busting ass and see women sucking up to thugs who are the scum of society .I should know , I 've been there .Women have a responsibility to ensure that does n't happen but they are not told that .Not only does n't demoralize them , it desensitizes them and causes them to despise women .Do you not get it ?Women are the nest builders , they work so hard and buy such useless shit .Then they want to marry a guy , quit working and spend his shit on stuff he did n't know he needed .Men do n't need lots of useless items , except maybe fags .I 've got lots of buddies that just work long enough to pay the rent on a small apartment they share , get food , internet and play video games when they are n't hitting the local bars on weekends .They are n't Don Juans , but bring home attractive enough girls for sex on occasion .The responsibilities are few and far between .Some of those girls even hang out and party and spend money on them .Now tell me , why would any guy want to bust his ass anymore if he is comfortable in this situation ?Men and women should do things for themselves and not center everything on attracting the opposite sex .So in other words , humans should completely change their biological urges , leaving aside what 's most natural for every species on the Earth - attracting a mate so they can reproduce .This is the problem with feminists and feminism .They think people should be able to cast aside biological imperatives and become sterile , intellectual economic units living only for themselves .Perhaps next you 'll suggest that there would be less waste if human just stopped going to the bathroom or less need for food production if only people stopped eating .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.67492"}

{"text": "There were , unfortunately , a large number of responses like this .But this comes as no surprise since there still are tech environments where , for example , design discussions turn into either filibusters or yelling matches , testing one 's endurance and tolerance levels in many directions .This response reflects a false sense of entitlement , and a perceived privilege to exclude and discriminate , using hostile behavior as the tool to accomplish the goal .The good news is that there are quite a few men as well who are intolerant of this awful behavior .My pondering : Is it just a subset , or does the entire group foster this behavior and willingly participate ?Based on the responses from colleagues and my own observations , there are definitely still groups in IT work environments which not only practice the \" locker room / battlefield \" mentality , but foster it as a fringe benefit to try and draw new employees .The good news is that these companies are being exposed and discussed in online tech groups when it happens , and blatant intolerance of such behavior is growing .In some environments this behavior is so pervasive that many men who do n't like it , ignore it and silently keep their eyes open for better work environments , proclaiming to their family and friends that they \" work with a bunch of immature idiots \" .The women in these same environments actively seek out better work environments , end up finding better jobs and leaving quicker .My pondering : Do managers know or care that this hurts their profit margin ?Usually , the less pervasive environments which only have one or a few employees practicing \" locker room / battlefield \" behavior also have a very vocal and obvious resistance to this behavior from both men and women , which is encouraging .Another bit of encouragement is that today , it is much easier to \" vote with your feet \" , and find a new job .There is still a shortage of skilled IT people , which means more choices and less tolerance for abuse .Bad group dynamics ultimately hurt a company 's bottom line in two ways : by causing a fast employee turnover , and by fostering a homogeneous group of people thinking in the same direction , which stifles creativity .Some companies operate better with time as managers realize this , and others do not .Skilled IT professions can seek out the companies with smarter , more socially aware management , and leave the slow - evolving companies in the dust .2 : This ( objectification of women ) will always happen , in the workplace , on the street , everywhere .This is what \" we \" do .This response is twist on the entitlement response shown above .It gives an excuse , although not legitimate , that this is \" what men do \" .Finding many men who do not do this disproves this statement , and forces me to change it to \" This is what immature men do \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.851955"}
