United States , 217 U.S. , at 381 .I concur in the judgments of the Court .MR .JUSTICE STEWART , concurring .The penalty of death differs from all other forms of criminal punishment , not in degree but in kind .It is unique in its total irrevocability .It is unique in its rejection of rehabilitation of the convict as a basic purpose of criminal justice .And it is unique , finally , in its absolute renunciation of all that is embodied in our concept of humanity .For these and other reasons , at least two of my Brothers have concluded that the infliction of the death penalty is constitutionally impermissible in all circumstances under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments .Their case is a strong one .But I find it unnecessary to reach the ultimate question they would decide .See Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority , 297 U.S. 288 , 347 ( Brandeis , J. , concurring ) .The opinions of other Justices today have set out in admirable and thorough detail the origins and judicial history of the Eighth Amendment 's guarantee against the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments , and the origin and judicial history of capital punishment .There is thus no need for me to review the historical materials here , and what I have to say can , therefore , be briefly stated .Legislatures -- state and federal -- have sometimes specified that the penalty of death shall be the mandatory punishment for every person convicted of engaging in certain designated criminal conduct .Congress , for example , has provided that anyone convicted of acting as a spy for the enemy in time of war shall be put to death .n3 The Rhode Island Legislature has ordained the death penalty for a life term prisoner who commits murder .Massachusetts has passed a law imposing the death penalty upon anyone convicted of murder in the commission of a forcible rape .An Ohio law imposes the mandatory penalty of death upon the assassin of the President of the United States or the Governor of a State .If we were reviewing death sentences imposed under these or similar laws , we would be faced with the need to decide whether capital punishment is unconstitutional for all crimes and under all circumstances .On that score I would say only that I can not agree that retribution is a constitutionally impermissible ingredient in the imposition of punishment .The instinct for retribution is part of the nature of man , and channeling that instinct in the administration of criminal justice serves an important purpose in promoting the stability of a society governed by law .When people begin to believe that organized society is unwilling or unable to impose upon criminal offenders the punishment they \" deserve , \" then there are sown the seeds of anarchy -- of self - help , vigilante justice , and lynch law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.91655"}

Bush ) , under that state 's capital punishment scheme , have a very limited role ( the Gov. does n't sign death warrants & has a very limited role in clemency ) .A $ TATE ECONOMIC BOYCOTT OF GEORGIA INTERNATIONALLY WILL OBVIOU$LY BE THE END RE$ULT OF GEORGIA DECIDING TO MURDER A PO$$IBLE INNOCENT TROY DAVI$ WITHOUT A NEW AND FAIR TRIAL ?US CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS WHO ARE ALSO LAWYERS BY TRADE , CONTINUE TO DENY poorer AMERICAN 'S PROPER LEGAL REPRESENTATION ! ! !THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NEEDS TO BEGIN A FORMAL INVESTIGATION INTO THESE US CONGRESSIONAL CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY , AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BEING INFLICTED ON poorer AMERICAN 'S LIKE MR.TROY DAVIS OF GEORGIA ! ! !HAVING BEEN DENIED APPEAL LAWYERS FOR THREE YEARS ON DEATH ROW IN GEORGIA MR .TROY DAVIS IS NOW BEING EXECUTED FOR A CRIME HE MIGHT NOT HAVE EVEN BEEN INVOLVED WITH ! ! !SENATOR OBAMA PLEASE LET THIS COUNTRIES VOTERS KNOW YOUR FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS ABOUT A NEEDED FUTURE REPAIR AND RENOVATION OF OUR BROKEN JUDICIAL SYSTEM THAT CONTINUES TO ALLOW THE EXECUTION 'S OF EVEN POSSIBLE INNOCENT AMERICAN 'S LIKE TROY DAVIS OF GEORGIA ? ? ? ? ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.4284"}
{"text": "It is in this context that we must consider whether the execution of these petitioners would violate the Eighth Amendment .I begin with what I consider a near truism : that the death penalty could so seldom be imposed that it would cease to be a credible deterrent or measurably to contribute to any other end of punishment in the criminal justice system .It is perhaps true that no matter how infrequently those convicted of rape or murder are executed , the penalty so imposed is not disproportionate to the crime and those executed may deserve exactly what they received .It would also be clear that executed defendants are finally and completely incapacitated from again committing rape or murder or any other crime .But when imposition of the penalty reaches a certain degree of infrequency , it would be very doubtful that any existing general need for retribution would be measurably satisfied .Most important , a major goal of the criminal law -- to deter others by punishing the convicted criminal -- would not be substantially served where the penalty is so seldom invoked that it ceases to be the credible threat essential to influence the conduct of others .For present purposes I accept the morality and utility of punishing one person to influence another .I accept also the effectiveness of punishment generally and need not reject the death penalty as a more effective deterrent than a lesser punishment .But common sense and experience tell us that seldom - enforced laws become ineffective measures for controlling human conduct and that the death penalty , unless imposed with sufficient frequency , will make little contribution to deterring those crimes for which it may be exacted .The imposition and execution of the death penalty are obviously cruel in the dictionary sense .But the penalty has not been considered cruel and unusual punishment in the constitutional sense because it was thought justified by the social ends it was deemed to serve .At the moment that it ceases realistically to further these purposes , however , the emerging question is whether its imposition in such circumstances would violate the Eighth Amendment .It is my view that it would , for its imposition would then be the pointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes .A penalty with such negligible returns to the State would be patently excessive and cruel and unusual punishment violative of the Eighth Amendment .It is also my judgment that this point has been reached with respect to capital punishment as it is presently administered under the statutes involved in these cases .Concededly , it is difficult to prove as a general proposition that capital punishment , however administered , more effectively serves the ends of the criminal law than does imprisonment .But however that may be , I can not avoid the conclusion that as the statutes before us are now administered , the penalty is so infrequently imposed that the threat of execution is too attenuated to be of substantial service to criminal justice .I concur in the judgments of the Court .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.46019"}

Dulles ( 1958 ) .This approach allows the Supreme Court to get to whatever result it considers desirable , regardless of what the text of the Constitution actually means .If the Court wanted to get rid of the death penalty , for example , it could simply announce that the death penalty no longer comports with current \" standards of decency , \" and thereby abolish it .Originalists object to this approach for many reasons , including the fact that it is inconsistent with democratic principles and the rule of law .Phrased differently , there is nothing in the Constitution that gives unelected judges the authority to overturn laws enacted by democratically elected legislatures , based on the judges ' own subjective ideas of what current \" standards of decency \" require .In response to the non - originalist approach to the Constitution , some judges and scholars - most prominently Justices Scalia and Thomas - have argued for a very narrow approach to original meaning that is almost willfully indifferent to current societal needs .To understand their approach , let us revisit the four questions raised in the joint statement concerning the settled history and meaning of the Eighth Amendment : ( 1 ) What standard should the Court use in deciding whether a punishment is unconstitutionally cruel ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.77989"}
{"text": "\" Carter 's appeal for a new moratorium falls at a time of mounting unease about the huge disparities in the use of capital punishment in America .For three days , The Arizona Republic has examined prosecutor conduct and misconduct , citing cases in which prosecutors stepped over the line without suffering consequences to themselves or the convictions they win .The question remains : What can be done about it ?Options already are in place .Yet , neither likes to do so .Prosecutors are arguably the most powerful people in the courtroom : They file the charges and offer the plea agreements .They determine whether to seek the death penalty , and , given mandatory sentencing , predetermine the consequence of a guilty verdict .Defense attorneys worry that if they cross a prosecutor , future clients could be treated more harshly the next time they face that prosecutor in court .Judges worry about prosecutors who use court rules to bypass those judges who rein them in .Both know that prosecutors are rarely sanctioned by the court or investigated by the State Bar of Arizona for ethical misconduct .So overly aggressive prosecutors continue to have their way in the courtroom - as long as they win cases , experts say .\" It comes from this ' end - justifies - the - means mentality , ' ' ' said Jon Sands , the federal public defender for Arizona .\" We 'll do anything we can to bring someone to justice .This symposium will be the culminating event of the American Bar Association 's eight - year endeavor to examine the fairness and accuracy of various death penalty jurisdictions in the United States .These states represent 65 % of the executions that have taken place in the U.S. in the modern death penalty era .The assessments have had a considerable impact on policy in those states as well as nationwide , and have played an important role in the continuing debate over capital punishment in the United States .Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter will open our symposium , which will be followed by a series of special issue panels discussing the ABA 's findings in various jurisdictions , recommendations for reform , and implications for the future of the death penalty in America .The Symposium is sponsored by the ABA Section of Individual Rights and Responsibilities , ABA Criminal Justice Section , Andrews Kurth , and Sutherland .Also , the IRR Section has announced that Ron Tabak will be the 2014 recipient of the Section 's Father Robert Drinan Award for Distinguished Service in recognition of his outstanding service and commitment .The award will be presented the evening of Friday , February 7 , 2014 in Chicago as part of the ABA 's 2014 Mid - Year Meeting .Monday , 14 October 2013 .That 's the title of an OpEd by Mark L.

{"text": "Both the age of Obama and Trump 's astonishing rise to prominence show that too many Americans do n't understand that the Constitution 's entire thrust is towards individual liberty , not government power .The Constitution does not impose its obligations on \" We , the People ; \" instead , it imposes them on the federal government itself .Unlike laws , which are limitations that governments impose upon people , the Constitution is a contract by which the People impose limitations on the government .To that end , the main body of the Constitution defines a functioning limited government .It is structured to ensure that , when it functions properly , no single branch can function alone .Once having structured a government that was theoretically immune to dictatorship , the Founders were then able to turn their attention to protecting the People 's unalienable under that government .They understood that , if the government can \" giveth \" something and then \" taketh \" it away again , that something is not a right ; it is , instead , a mere privilege .Rights belong to the People independent of government .The Constitution 's first ten amendments describe rights that are fundamental to the individual and , therefore , transcend government .The Founders stated them explicitly because they understood that even the most beneficent , well - intentioned government , once it got the bit between its teeth , could not be relied upon to protect these rights .It was therefore necessary to err on the side of caution by defining each individual 's inherent rights and warning federal government away from touching them .Even more importantly , the Founders vested the most important power of all - the power of the purse - in the House of Representatives , which is the branch of government closely connected to each individual American .House members serve for much shorter terms than Supreme Court justices ( life terms ) , executives ( minimum 4 year terms ) and Senators ( minimum 6 year terms ) .In addition to a Representative 's short term of office , which means the people can quickly punish or reward legislative conduct , the House of Representatives mirrors population dynamics .The Senate is fixed at two representatives per state , there 's only one president , and there are nine Supreme Court justices .The Founders also envisioned each branch zealously guarding its power from any encroachment by the other two branches .They would have been horrified if they could have seen the current relationship between Congress and the White House .Since 2010 , even though the majority in Congress was elected by citizens who disapproved of the executive branch 's overreach , a toxic blend of crony capitalism , corrupt collegiality , laziness , and craven fear has seen Congress willingly cede its power to the executive branch .Sadly , as Obama 's election showed and Trump 's candidacy promises , the People are just as ready as their Congress people to hand their rights over to a demagogue .We 've now had seven years to see what happens when people elect a charismatic leader who promises to carry out his agenda no matter what signals the People send when they vote for their Representatives and even their Senators .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.895096"}

Sullivan once and for all created a national rule that squared more fully with the free press guarantees of the First Amendment .In its ruling , the Court decided that public officials no longer could sue successfully for libel unless reporters or editors were guilty of \" actual malice \" when publishing false statements about them .And just what is malice when it comes to proving libel ?Retired Justice William J. Brennan , Jr. , who wrote the Sullivan decision , defined it as \" knowledge that the [ published information ] was false \" or that it was published \" with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not . \"In other words , public officials no longer could sue for libel simply by proving that something that had been broadcast or printed about them was false .Now they would have to prove that a journalist had knowingly printed false information while making little , if any , attempt to distinguish truth from lies .The Supreme Court later extended its so - called Sullivan rule to cover \" public figures , \" meaning individuals who are not in public office but who are still newsworthy because of their prominence in the public eye .Over the years , American courts have ruled that this category includes celebrities in the entertainment field , well - known writers , athletes , and others who often attract attention in the media .For purely private individuals , the test for proving libel is not as difficult .Although Supreme Court rulings such as the Sullivan decision apply everywhere in the United States , most states continue to have their own libel laws that cover private individuals .Usually those laws require that public figures who believe they have been libeled prove that a journalist has been negligent when publishing false information about them .Negligence , like malice , is a legal term that generally means carelessness on the part of a reporter or editor .Because private individuals have more reason than public officials to be left alone in the media , American libel laws recognize that they are entitled to more legal protection against false statements made about them .Every year hundreds of libel lawsuits are filed against newspapers , magazines , and radio and television stations in the United States .Typically , these cases are brought by current or former public officials , by entertainers , or by business executives who feel they have been damaged by critical media publicity -- usually accusing or suggesting that the person has engaged in unlawful , improper , or questionable activities .In December 1990 , for example , a judge on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court won a $ 6 million libel verdict against the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper because of a series of articles it carried in 1983 that suggested he was guilty of influence peddling .And in one of the largest libel verdicts ever reached against the media , a former district attorney from Texas named Victor Feazell was awarded $ 58 million in April 1991 after a Dallas television station accused him of accepting bribes to fix drunken driving cases .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.19791"}

{"text": "It is not denied that many , and probably most , capital crimes can not be deterred by the threat of punishment .Thus the argument can apply only to those who think rationally about the commission of capital crimes .Particularly is that true when the potential criminal , under this argument , must not only consider the risk of punishment , but also distinguish between two possible punishments .On the face of it , the assumption that such persons exist is implausible .In any event , this argument can not be appraised in the abstract .We are not presented with the theoretical question whether under any imaginable circumstances the threat of death might be a greater deterrent to the commission of capital crimes than the threat of imprisonment .We are concerned with the practice of punishing criminals by death as it exists in the United States today .Proponents of this argument necessarily admit that its validity depends upon the existence of a system in which the punishment of death is invariably and swiftly imposed .Our system , of course , satisfies neither condition .A rational person contemplating a murder or rape is confronted , not with the certainty of a speedy death , but with the slightest possibility that he will be executed in the distant future .The risk of death is remote and improbable ; in contrast , the risk of longterm imprisonment is near and great .In short , whatever the speculative validity of the assumption that the threat of death is a superior deterrent , there is no reason to believe that as currently administered the punishment of death is necessary to deter the commission of capital crimes .Whatever might be the case were all or substantially all eligible criminals quickly put to death , unverifiable possibilities are an insufficient basis upon which to conclude that the threat of death today has any greater deterrent efficacy than the threat of imprisonment .There is , however , another aspect to the argument that the punishment of death is necessary for the protection of society .The infliction of death , the States urge , serves to manifest the community 's outrage at the commission of the crime .It is , they say , a concrete public expression of moral indignation that inculcates respect for the law and helps assure a more peaceful community .The question , however , is not whether death serves these supposed purposes of punishment , but whether death serves them more effectively than imprisonment .There is no evidence whatever that utilization of imprisonment rather than death encourages private blood feuds and other disorders .Surely if there were such a danger , the execution of a handful of criminals each year would not prevent it .The assertion that death alone is a sufficiently emphatic denunciation for capital crimes suffers from the same defect .If capital crimes require the punishment of death in order to provide moral reinforcement for the basic values of the community , those values can only be undermined when death is so rarely inflicted upon the criminals who commit the crimes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.35904"}

Arizona , the Supreme Court concluded : .Assessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed , based on information as to his age , education , intelligence , or prior contact with authorities , can never be more than speculation ; a warning is a clearcut fact .More important , whatever the background of the person interrogated , a warning at the time of the interrogation is indispensable to overcome its pressures and to insure that the individual knows he is free to exercise the privilege at that point in time .In many instances , a prosecutor or investigator would rather hear what an individual has to say than attempt to prosecute them based on their testimony .In such cases , individuals may be granted immunity in exchange for providing information about a crime .For example , in the investigation of President Clinton 's relationship with Monica Lewinsky , Lewinsky was granted immunity in exchange for her testimony about her relationship with Clinton .Prosecutors commonly grant immunity to persons suspected of committing lesser crimes if their testimonies might help convict a more prominent suspect of a more serious crime . \"Double Jeopardy \" .Persons accused of crimes are also protected from what is called \" double jeopardy .\" In the words of the Fifth Amendment , no person shall \" be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb .\" If the result of a jury trial is an acquittal ( the jury finds the defendant \" not guilty \" ) , there can be no further legal action taken against the defendant for that crime .One exception to this rule occurs when a defendant challenges his or her guilty conviction and is granted a new trial ( typically because of some procedural error in the original trial ) .In this case , the \" jeopardy \" posed by the first trial is eliminated and a new trial can be convened , putting the defendant in jeopardy as if for the first time for the alleged crime .Another exception to the double jeopardy provision is really not an exception .It is possible for an individual , such as O.J. Simpson , to be tried in criminal court for a crime and then be sued in civil court for damages caused by the same criminal act .The laws and rules that apply to the two different legal systems are sufficiently different that , for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment , they are considered distinct .Additionally , an individual may also be tried for different crimes committed in the course of one action or set of actions .For example , when Timothy McVeigh was tried in Federal Court for bombing the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , he had been charged with murdering federal government employees and with destroying federal government property .The possibility remains that McVeigh could still be tried in Oklahoma state court for the murders of the other people killed in the bombing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.433395"}

{"text": "The rest of it ?Not so much .This post by PFAW Political Director Randy Borntrager was originally published in the Huffington Post .Discussions of Governor Kasich 's role in the 2016 election have centered around his strategy of defining himself to voters as an alternative to Jeb Bush : a moderate , compassionate conservative without Bush 's last name .This strategy presupposes that both Bush and Kasich are in fact middle - of - the - road Republicans who hold moderate positions that would make them electable next November .That proposition is false .Few issues demonstrate the extreme agenda of Bush , Kasich , and the Republican Party more than a woman 's right to choose .Kasich has directly targeted access to legal abortion in Ohio though enacting medically unnecessary , cumbersome laws that closed abortion clinics .He signed a bill including a policy that restricts rape crisis counselors from providing referrals to abortion services to rape survivors .Jeb Bush calls himself the \" most pro - life governor in modern times . \"As governor , he tried to restrict the ability of a mentally disabled rape victim to have an abortion .The \" Scarlet Letter \" law enacted during Bush 's term as governor required a single mother who did not know the father of her child to pay for a month - long newspaper ad before putting her child up for adoption .The ad had to include personal details about the mother and her sexual history , complete with dates and locations where the child could have been conceived .On Social Security , Kasich and Bush support former President George W. Bush 's plan to privatize Social Security .Had his plan been enacted , the stock market crash of 2008 would have decimated Social Security savings of seniors across the country .That does n't seem to bother anyone in the Republican field other than , of all people , Donald Trump .He 's actually spoken out against cuts to Social Security and Medicare , calling them \" not fair \" to workers .On immigration , Kasich and Bush have used less offensive language than Donald Trump , but both - and the rest of the leading Republican candidates - oppose President Obama 's policies that protect DREAMers and families from deportation .Neither Bush nor Kasich nor any leading Republican candidate supports comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship , even though that 's a commonsense policy that would enable undocumented immigrants to come out of the shadows , stay with their families , and contribute to the American economy .Kasich and Bush have reiterated time and again that their economic experience would make them ideal presidential candidates .The extreme GOP base might like those policies , but the fact is , they 've made it more difficult for working class families to get ahead .After accounting for inflation , the average Ohio household earned less in 2013 than it did in 1984 .Kasich 's 2015 budget cut taxes by only $ 24 for middle - class Ohioans , raised taxes by $ 20 for taxpayers in the lowest income bracket , yet included a $ 10,000 tax cut for the wealthiest Ohioans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.91441"}

Thompson , 390 U.S. 727 , 732 ( 1968 ) .To the extent that such a limited privilege might deny recovery in some marginal cases , it is , in my view , an acceptable price to pay for preserving a climate conducive to considered editorial judgment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.9193"}

Perry set his ongoing record on executions , there was Gov. George W. Bush , who handled the clemency process with the same cronyism and negligence that marked the worst moments of his presidency .And in both administrations there was the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles , which is an oxymoron , to put it mildly , since it virtually never recommends the commutation of death penalty cases .In the fantasy world of Gregg , the executive branch would rectify the mistakes made by the judicial branch in capital cases .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.77922"}

Virginia , which outlawed the execution of mentally retarded defendants .And the legislature has been slow to clarify jury instructions at the sentencing phase of capital cases-- the ambiguities , of course , favor the state-- while not pressuring prosecutors to adopt \" open - file \" discovery policies which also would make capital cases more fair .Since 1976 , it 's not unfair to say Texas has gone out of its way to negate , eliminate , or simply leave uninstalled the institutional safeguards and double - checks that should reasonably exist in any fair death penalty regime .The legislature and state constitution have neutered the judicial and executive branches -- even if Gov. Perry wanted to commute Buck 's sentence now , he could n't .The state trial judges whose capital decisions are tainted by campaigns have their cases reviewed by appellate judges who slyly declare in affirming convictions that the condemned may seek relief from the Boad of Pardons and Paroles .And the federal courts are only so much help , thanks to Congress .Somewhere , somehow , in that great conference room in the sky , Justice Douglas is saying to Justice White : \" I told you so , Whizzer . \"Death Be Not Proud .When Duane Buck 's execution was stayed Thursday night , after he already had eaten his last meal , there was a great deal of muted satisfaction on the part of death penalty foes .Some were happy for political reasons that Gov.

Robert Welch , Inc. , supra , at 340 .Those who publish defamatory falsehoods with the requisite culpability , however , are subject to liability , the aim being not only to compensate for injury but also to deter publication of unprotected material threatening injury to individual reputation .Permitting plaintiffs such as Herbert to prove their cases by direct as well as indirect evidence is consistent with the balance struck by our prior decisions .If such proof results in liability for damages which in turn discourages the publication of erroneous information known to be false or probably false , this is no more than what our cases contemplate and does not abridge either freedom of speech or of the press .Of course , if inquiry into editorial conclusions threatens the suppression not only of information known or strongly suspected to be unreliable but also of truthful information , the issue would be quite different .20 Perhaps such examination will lead to liability that would not have been found without it , but this does not suggest that the determinations in these instances will be inaccurate and will lead to the suppression of protected information .Suppose , for example , that a reporter has two contradictory reports about the plaintiff , one of which is false and damaging , and only the false one is published .In resolving the issue whether the publication was known or suspected to be false , it is only common sense to believe that inquiry from the author , with an opportunity to explain , will contribute to accuracy .If the publication is false but there is an exonerating explanation , the defendant will surely testify to this effect .21 Why should not the plaintiff be permitted to inquire before trial ?On the other hand , if the publisher in fact had serious doubts about accuracy , but published nevertheless , no undue self - censorship will result from permitting the relevant inquiry .Only knowing or reckless error will be discouraged ; and unless there is to be an absolute First Amendment privilege to inflict injury by knowing or reckless conduct , which respondents do not suggest , constitutional values will not be threatened .It is also urged that frank discussion among reporters and editors will be dampened and sound editorial judgment endangered if such exchanges , oral or written , are subject to inquiry by defamation plaintiffs .Moreover , given exposure to liability when there is knowing or reckless error , there is even more reason to resort to prepublication precautions , such as a frank interchange of fact and opinion .Accordingly , we find it difficult to believe that error - avoiding procedures will be terminated or stifled simply because there is liability for culpable error and because the editorial process will itself be examined in the tiny percentage of instances in which error is claimed and litigation ensues .Nor is there sound reason to believe that editorial exchanges and the editorial process are so subject to distortion and to such recurring misunderstanding that they should be immune from examination in order to avoid erroneous judgments in defamation suits .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.63927"}

Matt Gaetz , R - Fort Walton Beach , wants voters to change the Florida Constitution to reduce the time death - row inmates have to appeal their convictions .A second bill would strip the courts of their authority over post - conviction appeals and give that responsibility to state legislators .Gaetz says he wants to end the \" gamesmanship \" that has contributed to long appeals , which average 13 years .His approach may give comfort to those who believe everyone on death row is guilty as charged , but this ignores the history in Florida and the nation , where more than 138 people have been released from death row because they were found to be innocent .History tells us the death penalty is applied unfairly , unjustly and arbitrarily .When the American Bar Association studied Florida 's death - penalty system in 2006 , it found too many outcomes were determined by a defendant 's wealth .It said our system is plagued by racial disparities , problems with the qualifications of defense attorneys and confusion among juries .As one example , Florida remains one of only two states where you can be sentenced to death by a majority vote - rather than a unanimous vote - of the jury .Surely , the imposition of the death sentence should require a unanimous jury .Unfortunately , since the ABA released its report seven years ago , little has changed .In 2000 , under then - Gov .Jeb Bush , the Legislature similarly tried to set strict time limits on death - penalty appeals , but the Florida Supreme Court said the law was unconstitutional because it infringed on its rule - making powers in death - penalty cases .Stoking another separation - of - powers controversy this year wo n't solve the many problems .The best solution , really , would be to end the death penalty and let the monsters on death row die in prison without the chance of parole .That way , families would still get closure , society would be rid of them and we would n't waste significant time on a system that costs a lot of money and provides no deterrent value .Florida 's capital punishment system has a flaw that leads jurors to deliberate less thoroughly than in other states when deciding whether to recommend the death penalty .Florida and Alabama are the only two of 32 death penalty states not to require a unanimous jury vote as part of the sentencing process .Today a vote is expected in the Senate 's Criminal Justice Committee on a bill sponsored by Sen.

Stinneford , Professor of Law and Assistant Director , Criminal Justice Center , University of Florida Levin College of Law .Read the full discussion here .This approach begs complex questions , such as who decides what is decent and what is cruel ?Some Supreme Court justices believe it is the Court 's responsibility to make these decisions independently , because a punishment may be cruel and unusual even if it is popular among the general public and even if a legislature has deemed it appropriate .Throughout its history , the Court has ruled that certain practices are unconstitutional or indecent even when such practices were popular .Ending racial segregation in schools or restaurants and striking down bans on interracial marriage never could have been achieved by a popular vote in the American South .Black people were a political minority , and policies that denied their basic rights were extremely popular .Accordingly , progressives believe the Court must protect the disfavored , the unpopular , the minority groups who can expect no protection from officials elected by majority vote .For progressives , what constitutes cruel punishment can not be resolved by opinion polls or the popularity of the punishment .The legitimacy of a punishment must be assessed instead by evaluating whether it serves an appropriate and acceptable penological purpose .In this respect , the Eighth Amendment does not merely prohibit barbaric punishments ; it also bars disproportionate penalties .A sentence of life imprisonment without parole may be acceptable for some crimes , but it would violate the Constitution to condemn anyone to die in prison for shoplifting or simple marijuana possession .For progressives , the constitutionality of a particular punishment can not be evaluated in the abstract .The decency or legitimacy of a punishment can be assessed reliably only in context .I believe that the question whether the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment can not be resolved by simply asking whether a person deserves to die for the crime he has committed .I believe we must first ask whether we deserve to kill .Since the modern era of capital punishment in the United States began in the 1970s , 154 people have been proven innocent after being sentenced to death .We have executed more than 1400 people during the same time period .For every nine people executed , one innocent person has been exonerated .For progressives , this is an unacceptably high rate of error : The probability that an innocent person has been or will be executed offends our standards of decency , and renders the death penalty cruel and unusual punishment that violates the Eighth Amendment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.65221"}

{"text": "Virtually every study that has since been undertaken has reached the same result .In light of the massive amount of evidence before us , I see no alternative but to conclude that capital punishment can not be justified on the basis of its deterrent effect .C. Much of what must be said about the death penalty as a device to prevent recidivism is obvious -- if a murderer is executed , he can not possibly commit another offense .The fact is , however , that murderers are extremely unlikely to commit other crimes either in prison or upon their release .For the most part , they are first offenders , and when released from prison they are known to become model citizens .Furthermore , most persons who commit capital crimes are not executed .With respect to those who are sentenced to die , it is critical to note that the jury is never asked to determine whether they are likely to be recidivists .In light of these facts , if capital punishment were justified purely on the basis of preventing recidivism , it would have to be considered to be excessive ; no general need to obliterate all capital offenders could have been demonstrated , nor any specific need in individual cases . D. The three final purposes which may underlie utilization of a capital sanction -- encouraging guilty pleas and confessions , eugenics , and reducing state expenditures -- may be dealt with quickly .If the death penalty is used to encourage guilty pleas and thus to deter suspects from exercising their rights under the Sixth Amendment to jury trials , it is unconstitutional .United States v. Jackson , 390 U.S. 570 ( 1968 ) .Its elimination would do little to impair the State 's bargaining position in criminal cases , since life imprisonment remains a severe sanction which can be used as leverage for bargaining for pleas or confessions in exchange either for charges of lesser offenses or recommendations of leniency .Moreover , to the extent that capital punishment is used to encourage confessions and guilty pleas , it is not being used for punishment purposes .A State that justifies for the same purposes .In light of the previous discussion on deterrence , any suggestions concerning the eugenic benefits of capital punishment are obviously meritless .As I pointed out above , there is not even any attempt made to discover which capital offenders are likely to be recidivists , let alone which are positively incurable .No test or procedure presently exists by which incurables can be screened from those who would benefit from treatment .In addition , the \" cruel and unusual \" language would require that life imprisonment , treatment , and sterilization be inadequate for eugenic purposes .More importantly , this Nation has never formally professed eugenic goals , and the history of the world does not look kindly on them .If eugenics is one of our purposes , then the legislatures should say so forthrightly and design procedures to serve this goal .Until such time , I can only conclude , as has virtually everyone else who has looked at the problem , that capital punishment can not be defended on the basis of any eugenic purposes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.773285"}
{"text": "What was once a common punishment has become , in the context of a continuing moral debate , increasingly rare .The evolution of this punishment evidences , not that it is an inevitable part of the American scene , but that it has proved progressively more troublesome to the national conscience .The result of this movement is our current system of administering the punishment , under which death sentences are rarely imposed .The progressive decline in , and the current rarity of , the infliction of death demonstrate that our society seriously questions the appropriateness of this punishment today .The States point out that many legislatures authorize death as the punishment for certain crimes and that substantial segments of the public , as reflected in opinion polls and referendum votes , continue to support it .Yet the availability of this punishment through statutory authorization , as well as the polls and referenda , which amount simply to approval of that authorization , simply underscores the extent to which our society has in fact rejected this punishment .When an unusually severe punishment is authorized for wide - scale application but not , because of society 's refusal , inflicted save in a few instances , the inference is compelling that there is a deep - seated reluctance to inflict it .Indeed , the likelihood is great that the punishment is tolerated only because of its disuse .The objective indicator of society 's view of an unusually severe punishment is what society does with it , and today society will inflict death upon only a small sample of the eligible criminals .Rejection could hardly be more complete without becoming absolute .At the very least , I must conclude that contemporary society views this punishment with substantial doubt .The final principle to be considered is that an unusually severe and degrading punishment may not be excessive in view of the purposes for which it is inflicted .This principle , too , is related to the others .The States ' primary claim is that death is a necessary punishment because it prevents the commission of capital crimes more effectively than any less severe punishment .The first part of this claim is that the infliction of death is necessary to stop the individuals executed from committing further crimes .The more significant argument is that the threat of death prevents the commission of capital crimes because it deters potential criminals who would not be deterred by the threat of imprisonment .The argument is not based upon evidence that the threat of death is a superior deterrent .Indeed , as my Brother MARSHALL establishes , the available evidence uniformly indicates , although it does not conclusively prove , that the threat of death has no greater deterrent effect than the threat of imprisonment .The States argue , however , that they are entitled to rely upon common human experience , and that experience , they say , supports the conclusion that death must be a more effective deterrent than any less severe punishment .Because people fear death the most , the argument runs , the threat of death must be the greatest deterrent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.80107"}

California , 370 U.S. 660 .In the first place , it is clear that these sentences are \" cruel \" in the sense that they excessively go beyond , not in degree but in kind , the punishments that the state legislatures have determined to be necessary .Weems v. United States , 217 U.S. 349 .In the second place , it is equally clear that these sentences are \" unusual \" in the sense that the penalty of death is infrequently imposed for murder , and that its imposition for rape is extraordinarily rare .But I do not rest my conclusion upon these two propositions alone .These death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual .For , of all the people convicted of rapes and murders in 1967 and 1968 , many just as reprehensible as these , the petitioners are among a capriciously selected random handful upon whom the sentence of death has in fact been imposed .My concurring Brothers have demonstrated that , if any basis can be discerned for the selection of these few to be sentenced to die , it is the constitutionally impermissible basis of race .See McLaughlin v. Florida , 379 U.S. 184 .But racial discrimination has not been proved , n14 and I put it to one side .I simply conclude that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments can not tolerate the infliction of a sentence of death under legal systems that permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly and so freakishly imposed .For these reasons I concur in the judgments of the Court .MR .JUSTICE WHITE , concurring .The facial constitutionality of statutes requiring the imposition of the death penalty for first - degree murder , for more narrowly defined categories of murder , or for rape would present quite different issues under the Eighth Amendment than are posed by the cases before us .In joining the Court 's judgments , therefore , I do not at all intimate that the death penalty is unconstitutional per se or that there is no system of capital punishment that would comport with the Eighth Amendment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.17416"}

Salerno ( 1987 ) , to refuse a criminal defendant bail as a \" preventative measure .\" Together a judge 's decision should be considered proportionate to the nature of the criminal offense for which a defendant is charged .That 's why the framers wrote the Bill of Rights - to prohibit the British Bill of Wrongs done against their natural rights which under Natural Law are guaranteed by God .The Eighth Amendment 's prohibition against \" cruel and unusual \" punishments was unique in the 18th century because the Bill of Rights as a Natural Law document is entirely expressed in moral terms .Therefore , to be functional and relevant , \" it must be interpreted in moral language and through moral argument , \" Held wrote .Yet , since the 1900s , progressives , atheists , humanists and Positive Law scholars contend that employing moral language to judge cases regarding fundamental liberties or limits on state and federal power is virtually impossible .Progressives prefer an amoral approach to constitutional interpretation and scrupulously avoid at all costs the specter of Natural Law , while mandating the use of vague , moral - sounding language and moral argumentation to set down a field of protected liberty .Despite the fact that most historians agree that the Framers wanted to prohibit barbaric forms of punishment , including torture , as well as arbitrary and disproportionate penalties , there is little consensus on what specific punishments met this definition .The historical record shows that by the late 1800s , the Supreme Court had held that punishments like burning at the stake , disembowelment , and drawing and quartering violated the Eighth Amendment .In the early 1900s , the case of Weems v. U.S. ( 1910 ) , the Court further concluded that every punishment considered \" excessive \" would violate the cruel and unusual punishment clause .And , in Solem v. Helm ( 1983 ) , the Court developed a \" proportionality \" standard that required punishments , even simple imprisonment , to bear a rational relationship to the offense .The Court also held in Atkins v. Virginia ( 2002 ) that the mentally retarded , as a class , are exempt from the death penalty .Nevertheless , it has also handed down very controversial decisions concluding , for instance , that neither racial disparities in the application of capital punishment nor juvenile status at the time the offense was committed violate the Eighth Amendment .The exception to this rule was a de facto moratorium on the death penalty in Furman v. Georgia ( 1972 ) , which , with slightly different members on the high court , was restored in Gregg v. Georgia ( 1976 ) .Thus the death penalty has always been an existing punishment .Unfortunately , the bureaucratic procedures , delays through multiple appeals and costs make this ultimate punishment a rarity in the American criminal justice system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.241905"}

VIRGINIA , 536 U.S. 304 , 122 S. Ct .2242 , 153 L.

' \" Moreover , Scalia noted that execution of mildly retarded individuals in 1791 , when the Eighth Amendment was adopted , would not have been considered \" cruel and unusual .\" Rather , only the severely and profoundly retarded were historically protected .Another test that the Court employs to evaluate the constitutionality of particular punishments is somewhat less pliable , but still controversial .Popularly known as the originalist approach , this test permits the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate punishments that the Framers \" originally \" intended to remove from legislative fiat .The narrow , originalist formula has been criticized on a number of grounds .Some critics argue that a state representative 's vote to ratify the Eighth Amendment need not mean that representative believed that all the punishments authorized by the government comported with the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause .The representative might not have considered whether a particular punishment was in any way cruel or unusual as he cast his vote for ratification .Conversely , the representative might have cast his vote for ratification primarily because he believed that a certain punishment would be deemed cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment .No documentary evidence from the state ratification proceedings reflects which punishments particular representatives found permissible or impermissible under the Eighth Amendment .Nor is there much evidence indicating that the Framers intended their understanding of the Constitution to be binding on subsequent generations .JAMES MADISON , who was the primary architect of the Bill of Rights , believed that the thoughts and intentions of the Framers should have no influence on courts when they interpret the provisions of the Constitution . \" As a guide in expounding and applying the provisions of the Constitutions , \" Madison wrote , \" the debates and incidental decisions of the [ Constitutional ] Convention can have no authoritative character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.55475"}

{"text": "Another criticism of the narrow , originalist approach emanates from the language of the Eighth Amendment itself .Proponents of this viewpoint observe that the Eighth Amendment is written in very abstract language .It prohibits \" excessive \" bail and \" excessive \" fines , and does not set forth any specific amount that judges may use as a yardstick when setting bail or imposing fines .Although it prohibits cruel and unusual punishments , it does not enumerate which criminal penalties should be abolished .The Framers could have drafted the Eighth Amendment to explicitly outlaw certain barbaric punishments .They obviously were familiar with ways to draft constitutional provisions with such specificity .For example , Article I , Section 9 , of the Constitution provides that \" [ n]o Bill of Attainder or EX POST FACTO LAW shall be passed .\" No clearer or more precise language could have been used in this provision .The Framers could have employed similar concrete language for the Eighth Amendment , some critics reason , but did not choose to do so .Although there is not enough evidence to determine conclusively the appropriate manner in which the Framers expected or hoped that the Constitution would be interpreted , the origins of the Eighth Amendment are fairly clear .The notion that the severity of a punishment should bear some relationship to the severity of the criminal offense is one of the oldest in Anglo - Saxon law .By the seventeenth century , England had extended this principle to punishments that called for incarceration .In one case , the King 's Court ruled that \" imprisonment ought always to be according to the quality of the offence \" ( Hodges v. Humkin , 2 Bulst . 139 , 80 Eng .Rep. 1015 [ K.B. 1615 ] [ Croke , J. ] ) .Nine states adopted similar provisions for their own constitutions after the American Revolution .The concerns underlying the Eighth Amendment were voiced in two state - ratification conventions .2d 346 [ 1972 ] ) .In Virginia , PATRICK HENRY was worried that Congress might legalize torture as a method of coercing confessions from criminal defendants , and that the government should be prevented from employing such \" cruel and barbarous \" tactics ( as quoted in Furman ) .The concerns expressed by these representatives were legitimate in light of the punishments authorized by many states at the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified .These punishments ranged from whipping , branding , and the pillory to various methods of mutilation , including the slitting of nostrils and the removal of body parts .The death penalty was also prevalent .If James Madison or the other Framers intended to preserve these forms of punishment , they kept their intentions to themselves .The U.S. Supreme Court continues to consider specific instances of punishment in order to determine whether they violate the Eighth Amendment .In Hope v. Pelzer , 536 U.S. 730 , 122 S. Ct .2508 , 153 L.

{"text": "This is where our historical foray leads .The question now to be faced is whether American society has reached a point where abolition is not dependent on a successful grass roots movement in particular jurisdictions , but is demanded by the Eighth Amendment .To answer this question , we must first examine whether or not the death penalty is today tantamount to excessive punishment .V .If they would , then the death penalty is unnecessary cruelty , and , therefore , unconstitutional .There are six purposes conceivably served by capital punishment : retribution , deterrence , prevention of repetitive criminal acts , encouragement of guilty pleas and confessions , eugenics , and economy .These are considered seriatim below . A. The concept of retribution is one of the most misunderstood in all of our criminal jurisprudence .The principal source of confusion derives from the fact that , in dealing with the concept , most people confuse the question \" why do men in fact punish ? \" with the question \" what justifies men in punishing ? \"n84 Men may punish for any number of reasons , but the one reason that punishment is morally good or morally justifiable is that someone has broken the law .Thus , it can correctly be said that breaking the law is the sine qua non of punishment , or , in other words , that we only tolerate punishment as it is imposed on one who deviates from the norm established by the criminal law .The fact that the State may seek retribution against those who have broken its laws does not mean that retribution may then become the State 's sole end in punishing .Our jurisprudence has always accepted deterrence in general , deterrence of individual recidivism , isolation of dangerous persons , and rehabilitation as proper goals of punishment .See Trop v. Dulles , 356 U.S. , at 111 ( BRENNAN , J. , concurring ) .Retaliation , vengeance , and retribution have been roundly condemned as intolerable aspirations for a government in a free society .Punishment as retribution has been condemned by scholars for centuries , and the Eighth Amendment itself was adopted to prevent punishment from becoming synonymous with vengeance .It is plain that the view of the Weems Court was that punishment for the sake of retribution was not permissible under the Eighth Amendment .This is the only view that the Court could have taken if the \" cruel and unusual \" language were to be given any meaning .Retribution surely underlies the imposition of some punishment on one who commits a criminal act .But , the fact that some punishment may be imposed does not mean that any punishment is permissible .If retribution alone could serve as a justification for any particular penalty , then all penalties selected by the legislature would by definition be acceptable means for designating society 's moral approbation of a particular act .The \" cruel and unusual \" language would thus be read out of the Constitution and the fears of Patrick Henry and the other Founding Fathers would become realities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.863075"}

Georgia , 47 Ga.297 [ 1872 ] ) .Similarly , the U.S. Supreme Court wrote that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits crucifixion , breaking on the wheel , and other punishments that involve a lingering death ( In re Kemmler , 136 U.S. 436 , 10 S. Ct .930 , 34 L.

McMillian , 503 U.S. 1 , 112 S. Ct .995 , 117 L.

Dulles , 356 U.S. 86 ( 1958 ) , marked the next major cruel and unusual punishment case in this Court .Trop , a native - born American , was declared to have lost his citizenship by reason of a conviction by court - martial for wartime desertion .Writing for himself and Justices Black , DOUGLAS , and Whittaker , Chief Justice Warren concluded that loss of citizenship amounted to a cruel and unusual punishment that violated the Eighth Amendment .Emphasizing the flexibility inherent in the words \" cruel and unusual , \" the Chief Justice wrote that \" the Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society . \"Justice Frankfurter , dissenting , urged that expatriation was not punishment , and that even if it were , it was not excessive .While he criticized the conclusion arrived at by the Chief Justice , his approach to the Eighth Amendment question was identical .n33 The fact that the penalty under attack was only 90 days evidences the Court 's willingness to carefully examine the possible excessiveness of punishment in a given case even where what is involved is a penalty that is familiar and widely accepted .We distinguished Robinson in Powell v. Texas , 392 U.S. 514 ( 1968 ) , where we sustained a conviction for drunkenness in a public place and a fine of $ 20 .Four Justices dissented on the ground that Robinson was controlling .The analysis in both cases was the same ; only the conclusion as to whether or not the punishment was excessive differed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.14519"}

Maryland established this point fairly firmly .It is counterintuitive , to say the least , to use the sort of legislation that doomed the Articles of Confederation as evidence for interpreting a Constitution that was adopted precisely to take away the states ' power to enact such legislation .Regarding the common law as fundamental law , I agree that Eighteenth century legal thinkers were not always as precise as we would like them to be - but nonetheless , the idea was not an idiosyncratic or transient one .It was the conceptual foundation for the unwritten English Constitution , one of the major ideological justifications for the American Revolution , and one of the primary bases for both state and federal bills of rights .Finally , as I noted in my initial comment , I agree that federalism concerns play a role in the Bill of Rights , particularly regarding the 10th Amendment .I tend to agree with Amar that the Establishment Clause is at least partly about federalism .But notice that this Clause does not read like an \" individual rights \" provision at all .It says \" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion .\" This language can fairly be read as a limitation of federal power ( Congress shall not create a national church ) and a protection of states ' rights ( Congress shall not interfere with state establishments of religion ) .I am also not saying that there is no connection whatsoever between federalism and individual rights .To the extent federalism requires lawmaking to occur at the local level , individuals will often ( but not always ) have more power to influence the process and protect their own interests .But the Supremacy Clause makes clear that the federal government 's power is supreme within its proper sphere .If the Bill of Rights were read to require the federal government to follow local rules regarding all the individual rights therein , this would go a long way toward negating the Supremacy Clause and bringing back the ineffectual Articles of Confederation regime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.64726"}

{"text": "They argued that the common law differed in every State .This modern way of thinking about common law evolved in the 1790s , at around the same time the Bill of Rights was adopted .For those with this view , it would be nonsensical to limit federal punishments to those permitted by \" federal \" or \" general \" common law : there was no such animal .But read the Iowa piece if you 're interested .I explain this position in much greater detail there .I also disagree about the statutory interpretation point .I do n't think it 's that significant that different legislatures chose different ways of saying the same thing .When we infer that differences in language must imply differences in meaning , we are generally applying that canon to a single document or at least to a single statutory scheme .So that Pennsylvania and Rhode Island said only \" unusual \" or \" cruel or unusual \" does not preclude the conclusion that they meant \" unusual in this State . \"And , as you say , the \" in this State \" is a given , because the trial was to take place in state court .The proposals for a cruel and unusual punishments clause were made before the Judiciary Act of 1789 created the lower courts .Moreover , it would have been cumbersome to add language to the Eighth Amendment to get the \" in this State \" point across .I suppose it could have said : \" Punishments that are cruel and unusual in the State in which the offense was committed shall not be inflicted .\" But that would have broken up the flow of the Amendment and , more importantly , would have been a sharp deviation from the language of the Virginia Bill of Rights ( and , in turn , the English Bill of 1689 ) which was copied nearly verbatim .In the Virginia and English Bills , they did n't have to worry about the dual sovereignty issue .When they transplanted that language into the Eighth Amendment , they did so without taking that dual sovereignty issue head on .My point is not that everyone understood the Clause to be State - specific .It is rather that some people probably assumed it was , others probably assumed it was n't , and still others -- perhaps most -- never really thought about the issue .Finally , on rational basis review , I do n't disagree that that 's how the Eighth Amendment should be applied to the States , if at all .I have not done the research on that issue to come to any conclusion .But I strongly disagree that the Eighth Amendment itself was widely thought to give Congress great deference .The whole point of most of the provisions of the Bill was to sharply limit Congress .I doubt they thought they were limiting Congress by forcing Congress only to have some rational basis for the punishments it prescribed .The sanguinary laws of England you refer to were sharply resisted by colonial juries , who regularly nullified those laws , and were later held up by the Republicans as exhibit A as to why the Constitution could not be thought to absorb the common law of England .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.76405"}

Supreme Court on some grounds related to the 14th Amendment !The vast majority of 1st Amendment challenges brougnt to court in the 20th century involved using the 14th Amendment to bootstrap the 1st Amendment into some matter which would otherwise be totally within the jurisdiction of state law .Thus , what was originally envisioned strictly as a restriction upon congress is now viewed as a restriction upon any and all \" state actors , \" which includes any person whose pay originates with the treasury of the several states or any of their subsidiary jurisdictional bodies .The last half of the 19th century was marked by several decisions of the United States Supremem Court which were remarkably insensitive in their broadly - Christian assertions to various non - Christian minorities .Over a decade later , in Davis v. Beason , 133 U.S. 333 , 10 S.Ct . 299 ( February 3 , 1890 ) , the Supreme Court relied upon Reynolds in order to reach the same result .The text of this decision is easy to read , and it embodies a clear antagonism to those religious beliefs of minor sects which offend the mainstream morality of the Christian majority .Just read it for yourself : .Bigamy and polygamy are crimes by the laws of all civilized and Christian countries .They are crimes by the laws of the United States , and they are crimes by the laws of Idaho .They tend to destroy the purity of the marriage relation , to disturb the peace of families , to degrade woman , and to debase man .Few crimes are more pernicious to the best interests of society , and receive more general or more deserved punishment .To extend exemption from punishment for such crimes would be to shock the moral judgment of the community .To call their advocacy a tenet of religion is to offend the common sense of mankind .If they are crimes , then to teach , advise , and counsel their practice is to aid in their commission , and such teaching and counseling are themselves criminal , and proper subjects of punishment , as aiding and abetting crime are in all other cases .The term ' religion ' has reference to one 's views of his relations to his Creator , and to the obligations they impose of reverence for his being and character , and of obedience to his will .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.51265"}
{"text": "And it 's an evolving standard , since the mores of society change .Some longstanding practices - drawing and quartering , disemboweling , burning alive - were understood to be banned outright from the earliest days .In 1910 , the Supreme Court ruled that certain forms of hard labor , known as cadena temporal , were cruel .More recently , the courts have struck down punishments that were excessive in relation to the crime committed .The ratcheting up of prosecution for drug offenses , mandatory minimum sentences , three strikes laws , and other \" tough on crime \" measures has been widely popular , causing an explosion in the prison population around the country .Building expensive new prisons to house all these new inmates has been decidedly less popular .Courts have naturally been reluctant to order the wholesale release of prisoners when jails are overcrowded .Yet we saw a series of cases starting in the early 1970s where they did just that .The U.S. Supreme Court frequently strikes down such orders from lower courts , tending to bend over backwards to defer to the judgment of state elected officials and the not unreasonable concern for the safety of the public .So , for example , in a 1981 case called Rhodes v. Chapman , SCOTUS overruled an order from the 6th Circuit which ruled that doubling up inmates in cells designed for one person was cruel and unusual .They outlined a test : .( a ) Conditions of confinement , as constituting the punishment at issue , must not involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain , nor may they be grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting imprisonment .But conditions that can not be said to be cruel and unusual under contemporary standards are not unconstitutional .To the extent such conditions are restrictive and even harsh , they are part of the penalty that criminals pay for their offenses against society .( b )In view of the District Court 's findings of fact , virtually every one of which tends to refute respondents ' claim , its conclusion that double celling at the prison constituted cruel and unusual punishment is insupportable .( c )The five considerations on which the District Court relied are insufficient to support its constitutional conclusion .Such considerations properly are weighed by the legislature and prison administration rather than by a court .They fall far short in themselves of proving cruel and unusual punishment , absent evidence that double celling under the circumstances either inflicts unnecessary or wanton pain or is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting imprisonment .In the present case , however , there 's very strong evidence that the overcrowding had reached a point well beyond mere inconvenience such that the inmates were actually being put in mortal danger .That 's simply unacceptable .In this context , Scalia 's plea for individual remedy for an institutional problem is absurd .The issue is n't individual mistreatment but an overall set of conditions that are outrageous .As to the risk to the decent people of California of having an additional 40,000-odd felons freed , one presumes officials will weigh the releases accordingly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.57167"}

{"text": "There has been a great deal of experience with government support of medical care , much of it in Europe , which should help us to understand why this is so .For example , a great weakness of the Forand Bill was that it provided only for hospitalization and medical care in the hospitals .People who have health insurance are hospitalized more than noninsured persons , in part , at least , because they know that their hospital care will be paid for .The demand that would have been created by the Forand Bill would have been even more serious .Old people tend to live alone or in easily broken homes , and once hospitalized they might have nowhere else to go .This is particularly true when there is some residual disability .In England , where virtually all medical services are now provided through the National Health Service , this problem was pressing during the early years of the service .There was much \" silting up \" of the hospital beds by old patients with chronic diseases .The Forand Bill could not have been better designed to silt up our hospital beds and to keep them silted up .Later bills have included provision for payment for home care and nursing - home care , which are cheaper and often more appropriate for the patient .Care in a doctor 's office is the most economical and sometimes the best form of treatment , but it was conspicuously absent from most of the proposals advanced earlier .Thus , a patient who has to pay for an X ray in the doctor 's office , but who is insured against the cost of that X ray in the hospital , has a good chance of ending up in the hospital .A second frequently overlooked consideration in the Forand debate was the fact that a payment mechanism alone may have inflationary effects .Since the aged have low incomes and much illness , the advent of social security or other payments for their medical care would probably produce a sharp rise in the amount of medical care they receive , and therefore in the total cost .The history of fees and charges , furthermore , shows that they rise more easily when paid by insurance than when they have to be pried out of individual pockets .However , any attempt to control the cost and use of health service by fiscal means alone will not he more than partly successful .This would be like trying to control automobile accidents by manipulation of insurance premiums , when we are well aware that safe driving is a function of road construction , traffic cops , stop - and - go lights , licensing practices , driver training , and many other things .The problem of controlling the cost of health services is one of the considerations that will inevitably push the government more deeply into the field of medical services , once it has entered .It is equally certain that before long the government would become preoccupied with the problems of the quality and distribution of the care it purchases .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.97414"}
