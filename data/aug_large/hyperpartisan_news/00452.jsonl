{"text": "The fix was in and it was simple .This was an attempt - a successful attempt - to nail Nixon for something his immediate predecessor had in fact done not in one presidential campaign but two .To paint Republicans of the day as corrupt .Period .It worked .In a very real sense , perhaps the worst thing that happened to Senate and House Democrats was the long stretch of almost unbroken power they enjoyed beginning in 1932 's FDR landslide .From 1932 until 1980 - 48 years - the Democrats had the run of the U.S. Senate for 44 of the 48 .Losing control only twice in two brief two - year stretches , 1946 - 1948 and again from 1952 - 1954 .For those 48 years - that 's literally almost half a century - they dominated all the committees , the staff structure and they set the agenda .For House Democrats the run was even longer - losing control only in the same two cycles as their Senate counterparts , but ruling the House with an iron fist for an even longer reign in 58 of the 62 years between 1932 - 1994 .Well over half - a - century .Such complete control inevitably bred a bold arrogance , an arrogance that in turn encouraged an even bolder hypocrisy which predictably bred corruption .Sauce for the goose was never sauce for the gander .It was OK to get Nixon - verboten to touch LBJ , the President who was , no coincidence , a former Senate Majority Leader himself from 1955 until his election as JFK 's vice president in 1960 .By February of 1973 LBJ had died .So the double - standard from Senate Democrats , the bold \" F - you \" style hypocrisy in protecting even a dead LBJ was staggering .The hangover from this period of total control has carried into the actions of today 's House and Senate Democrats .Now comes the Benghazi investigation .The House GOP and Benghazi Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina are in a very different place than the GOP Senators in 1973 .In 1973 there was no Fox or talk radio or Internet .Hence GOP Senators were essentially forced to participate in an exercise that they knew ahead of time was fixed from the get - go .From the subject they were allowed to investigate - or not investigate - not to mention the media coverage they would receive , the Senate GOP of 1973 was in a very different situation than the GOP House of today .A period refreshed with their four - year return to power from 2006 - 2010 .They still think like the Senate Democrats of 1973 , who ordered an investigation of Nixon - an investigation that eventually drove Nixon from office .Forcing Nixon out for doing exactly what LBJ had done .There 's a lesson here for Congressman Gowdy .And while he may not know this history of Watergate , he most assuredly has well demonstrated a prosecutor 's drive to demand - and get - the facts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.79197"}
