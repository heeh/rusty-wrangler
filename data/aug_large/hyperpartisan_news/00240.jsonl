{"text": "FC St Pauli fans have helped lead solidarity protests in support of about 300 West African refugees in Hamburg .About 300 West African refugees reached the German city of Hamburg early last year after a long and perilous journey from Libya .They had , like countless other refugees travelling from north Africa , crossed the Mediterranean to the Italian island of Lampedusa the name that the group of 300 later adopted for themselves .The refugees had hoped to receive refugee status from the German state .However , authorities , deferring to European Union guidelines , refused to provide them with any sort of accommodation and tried to expel them from Hamburg .As refugees , the Lampedusa group had nowhere else to go .They decided to stay and began organising a solidarity campaign to counter the intimidation from the authorities .What no one could have predicted is the immense , spontaneous wave of support their campaign gained .Churches and mosques opened their doors ( although the mosques were often less public about it ) .Squats and left - wing cultural centres made space for refugees .About 80 refugees were taken in by the St Pauli Church .St Pauli Church received daily donations of blankets and food to support the refugees .The professional football team FC St Pauli donated drinks and fan apparel .They gave the refugees free tickets to every home game .Two trade unions organised a welcome party in their headquarters and accepted the refugees as members , giving them the legal protection of the union .In one of the campaign 's more unique moments , a well - known club bouncer spent weeks guarding the church after passersbyers harassed the refugees and shouted racist slurs .The refugees returned the solidarity on October 28 by playing a key role in a demonstration against rising rents organised by the local \" Right to the City \" coalition .Despite the solidarity , Hamburg 's city government ( led by the Social Democratic Party ) stuck to its story : the refugees ' presence in Hamburg violated European law , so they must go .The movement 's political momentum accelerated in early October after a ship full of refugees sank near Lampedusa , killing 270 .Solidarity from below grew , but no change was signalled from above .Rather , Hamburg authorities laid down an ultimatum that all refugees had to register with the police by October 11 .On October 11 , large - scale racist police checks were undertaken with the aim of registering the refugees in preparation for deportation , triggering a wave of protests .That evening , more than 1000 people took part in a spontaneous , loud and angry march .The same happened the day after and the day after that .Hamburg 's most famous left - wing autonomous centre , the Rote Flora , hosted a general assembly to discuss how the police checks should be dealt with , culminating in another demonstration .The assembly answered the government 's ultimatum with one of their own : should the government not end the police checks within the next few days , the movement would escalate its tactics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.0979"}
