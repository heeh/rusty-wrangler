Imohe , the economics minister at the Nigerian Embassy in Washington , said he had passed on questions from a reporter to his government this week about Shell but had not yet received a reply .Behind Shell 's confidential stance are the company 's own financial motivations , too .The report said negotiations with Nigeria over $ 385 million in bonus payments could be jeopardized by publication of too much information .While reserves are a key indicator by which outsiders assess an oil company 's future prospects , Shell 's dealings with Nigeria resonate beyond the stock market .Nigeria is the world 's seventh biggest oil exporter .Shell 's documents about Nigeria portray a sometimes fragile marriage of the two sides and offer a window into the kind of relationship that is vital to global energy security .Most of the world 's oil resides in less - developed countries like Nigeria , yet much of the financial and technological resources needed to develop that oil belongs to Western oil companies .The documents give a far bleaker assessment of Nigerian operations than the company 's public disclosures .For example , Nigeria has called for an end to the daily practice of releasing billions of cubic feet of natural gas into the atmosphere by 2008 .The flared gas , a byproduct of oil production , has become an environmental and political issue .Shell 's Web site says this opportunity to gather gas is going well .Corrigan said the company is committed to meeting the target .But a high - level company review last December found that many oil field projects were now seen as immature because of the lack of gas- gathering plans , many of which were still a long way from a possible request for funds .This , in turn , prompted concerns that oil production would have to be shut in without a way to utilize the gas .Natural gas is more expensive to transport than oil , so flaring the gas has been the most economical approach .So far Shell has not released a country breakdown of its reserve restatements , but it told oil industry analysts last month that Nigeria and Australia were the two largest .Company documents show that Shell 's senior managers were told in December that 720 million barrels in Nigeria were non - compliant with SEC guidelines and an additional 814 million barrels were potentially noncompliant .At the end of 2002 Shell booked 2.524 billion barrels of proven reserves for Nigeria , but after internal reviews and a tightening of company guidelines , the December report said only 990 million barrels fully complies with current Shell guidelines .The document recommended that any debooking of proved reserves for Shell 's venture in Nigeria not be identified publicly with Nigeria but classified under a wider geographic area .Last month , when Shell reported more details about the reserve downgrading , it said African operations accounted for 1.5 billion barrels of the revision .Shell has other operations in Africa , including Libya and Egypt , but Nigeria is the only African country listed in a potential reserves exposure catalogue distributed to senior executives late last year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.23717"}

'These rapid changes in the price of oil will be a feast - and - famine set of economic consequences for the next few years , with much instability , ' Olson said .For the last nine years , American oil production has only climbed , growing steadily from 5 million barrels per day in 2005 to 8.6 million last year .Drillers in the top seven U.S. shale plays get 43 to 64 percent of the oil out of their wells in the first three years of pumping , according to research by David Hughes , a fellow at the Post Carbon Institute .In reports published in 2013 and 2014 , Hughes has said that the U.S. Energy Information Administration 's long - term oil output projections are overly optimistic .The problem at present is that so - called ' tight oil ' drillers are cutting capital expenditure budgets , and creating new wells is a front - loaded investment .Nearly all of the costs come in the first two phases : drilling for exploration and hydrofracking , the process of pumping a mixture of water and chemicals into the ground to break up rock formations and release oil and gas .The number of rigs drilling new oil and gas wells in the United States has fallen 25 percent from the highs in September .The slide has accelerated in the last two weeks , with another 177 rig reductions , bringing the total number of operating rigs to 1,456 .To be sure , some new wells have been drilled , but producers have delayed fracking them .In its most recent report , the North Dakota Industrial Commission pointed out that 775 drilled wells in the state 's Bakken Shale were waiting to be completed at the end of November .While some of the wells were not being completed due to a backlog of work for fracking crews , some companies have made the strategic decision to put off the investment in the second phase , Hughes told CNBC .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.70521"}

'They 've been building out strategic storage .The goal is to build out to about 500 million barrels , compared to the U.S. capacity of 700 million to 800 million barrels , ' said Jeff Brown of Singapore - based energy consultants FGE .Brown said that while the numbers are a little murky , China has already built out about 150 million barrels of extra storage , with more capacity planned through the end of the year . 'They take a lot of pride in buying oil when it 's cheap , ' he said .Despite the massive capacity boom , China is still buying more oil than it can store -- and all that crude has to go somewhere .The solution lies in the Strait of Malacca .At anchor just a few kilometers off the coast of Malaysia lies the TI Europe , brimming with about 3 million barrels of oil destined for China .This 440,000 tonne monster is the world 's biggest tanker .She has been leased by the China 's state owned oil company at an estimated cost of $ 40,000 a day , to store oil until it can be shipped to China in smaller vessels .And she 's not the only one .Oil tanker analyst Richard Matthews of Gibson Shipbroking in the U.K. says there has been a surge in the number of supertankers being leased for storage . 'Normally , excluding Iranian ships , you might see only two or three ships storing , and they could be supporting offshore projects , ' he said . 'Now there are up to 17 or 18 non - Iranian tankers . 'Supertankers can also be used to store oil in a market where the future price of crude is expected to be significantly higher than the current price .Speculators buy cheap , bear the huge cost of storage and finance , and still make a profit when they sell a few months later .But analysts say that , for now , the difference between the current and future price is not wide enough to rake in speculative profits , which points to China filling its boats .China could also turn to land facilities for storage , mainly in South Africa .But the Strait of Malacca has an advantageous location , situated halfway between the big oil producers and the Chinese mainland .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.20788"}

{"text": "Infrastructure Interdependencies a Problem .Emergency actions by ERCOT prevented the generation outages from causing the entire system from failing .ERCOT 's emergency operations seemed to work okay , given the difficult situation .The primary problem on Wednesday was a lack of generator preparation for the extreme cold and the hazards that the weather brought with it .Given those problems , ERCOT probably did as well as it could .Potential policy problems mostly lay elsewhere .In some cases there were interdependences between the power system and other infrastructure systems that magnified the costs of the rolling consumer outages .For example , some of the controlled outages idled natural gas pipeline compressor stations , reducing pipeline pressure and hampering the ability of natural gas generation plants to get fuel they needed .Other power plants found their fuel supplies curtailed under natural gas priority rules that were last updated in the early 1970s .While the linkages between the electric power system and the natural gas pipeline system ca n't be severed , actions can be taken to make each system a little more robust to problems with the other .Another example , the power outage left many traffic signals out , so a power system problem added to an already difficult roadway congestion problem .Reports from Austin attributed at least one traffic accident to the loss of power to a traffic signal .Battery backup systems are widely available for traffic signals , and the City of Austin was already planning to begin installing the systems later this year .Other cities should take note .Perhaps most or all cell phone towers have battery backup power , helping to assure continued lines of communication when power goes out .But one cable company served by El Paso Electric reported intermittent loss of service after its battery backup system was drained from repeated loss of power from the grid .While the loss of mid - day movies and soap operas may not be a serious public policy concern , it is n't too hard to imagine conditions under which timely dissemination of information about health issues could be critical .Companies in the communications business should consider whether further steps are necessary to make their communication systems robust to failures in supporting infrastructure systems .ERCOT Interconnecting ?It is entirely likely that , had power companies in ERCOT been linked more substantially to other utilities in the state and utilities in neighboring states , Wednesday 's rolling blackouts could have been completely averted .This conclusion is obviously not enough of an argument by itself to justify reforming the state 's policy of isolating ERCOT .But it may be sufficient to rekindle discussions about the costs and benefits of ERCOT 's electrical isolation .Connections from ERCOT into to the southeast corner of the state would be valuable , in case of another emergency .It seems a shame for excess power capacity in various corners of the state to be unavailable at times of stress .But possibly it is the case that Texas can , as the saying goes , have its cake and eat it too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.97786"}

{"text": "For example , some of the controlled outages idled natural gas pipeline compressor stations , reducing pipeline pressure and hampering the ability of natural gas generation plants to get fuel they needed .Other power plants found their fuel supplies curtailed under natural gas priority rules that were last updated in the early 1970s .While the linkages between the electric power system and the natural gas pipeline system ca n't be severed , actions can be taken to make each system a little more robust to problems with the other .Another example , the power outage left many traffic signals out , so a power system problem added to an already difficult roadway congestion problem .Reports from Austin attributed at least one traffic accident to the loss of power to a traffic signal .Battery backup systems are widely available for traffic signals , and the City of Austin was already planning to begin installing the systems later this year .Other cities should take note .Perhaps most or all cell phone towers have battery backup power , helping to assure continued lines of communication when power goes out .But one cable company served by El Paso Electric reported intermittent loss of service after its battery backup system was drained from repeated loss of power from the grid .While the loss of mid - day movies and soap operas may not be a serious public policy concern , it is n't too hard to imagine conditions under which timely dissemination of information about health issues could be critical .Companies in the communications business should consider whether further steps are necessary to make their communication systems robust to failures in supporting infrastructure systems .ERCOT Interconnecting ?It is entirely likely that , had power companies in ERCOT been linked more substantially to other utilities in the state and utilities in neighboring states , Wednesday 's rolling blackouts could have been completely averted .This conclusion is obviously not enough of an argument by itself to justify reforming the state 's policy of isolating ERCOT .But it may be sufficient to rekindle discussions about the costs and benefits of ERCOT 's electrical isolation .Connections from ERCOT into to the southeast corner of the state would be valuable , in case of another emergency .It seems a shame for excess power capacity in various corners of the state to be unavailable at times of stress .But possibly it is the case that Texas can , as the saying goes , have its cake and eat it too .The Tres Amigas project has proposed building a high - tech transmission link that would simultaneously link up the Eastern , Western , and ERCOT interconnections .At full capacity , the project would be capable of supplying up to 5,000 MW of power to the ERCOT grid - more than sufficient to cover Wednesday 's shortfall ( assuming sufficient in - state transmission to carry the power ) .State regulators and many power industry players in the state are reluctant to support the project , citing a desire to protect the current regulatory status quo .But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission too has acted to protect the status quo in the past , and has signaled a willingness to continue to protect it should ERCOT link up to Tres Amigas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.06977"}
{"text": "According to FERC , power producers were forced to turn to coal and fuel oil as they struggled to get hold of enough gas to meet demand .Gas - fired generation actually fell slightly between December and January as gas shortages forced generators to switch to other fuels , with coal making up most of the shortfall .Forced generation outages and cutbacks reduced the availability of generating capacity by as much as 30 percent of peak demand in some areas during Jan 6 - 7 .A significant number of the generation outages were caused by fuel issues \" including gas curtailments , no fuel , oil delivery and frozen coal , \" according to FERC .PJM , the transmission operator in the Mid - Atlantic area , lost more than 41,000 megawatts of generating capacity on Jan 6 - 7 , almost 30 percent of its peak load .More than 9,000 megawatts were lost as a result of fuel issues .In addition , 5,000 megawatts of combustion turbines failed to start when called on by the grid .The Midcontinent Independent System Operator ( MISO ) reported 33,000 megawatts of generating capacity were lost on Jan 6 - 7 , of which almost 7,000 megawatts were related to fuel problems .And the New York Independent System Operator ( NYISO ) recorded 4,000 megawatts of capacity lost , of which 2,000 were due to fuel issues .Some generators were unable to obey dispatch instructions from the grid because they could not obtain enough extra gas on the intra - day market - underscoring the need for improved coordination between the gas and electricity industries .With the grid under extreme stress , transmission operators declared power emergencies on several occasions .Contingency plans were activated including voltage reductions , emergency energy purchases , emergency demand response , and appeals for conservation .On Feb 6 , the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO ) issued an appeal for conservation when cold weather elsewhere in the country pulled gas supplies away from the state and left generators scrambling to obtain sufficient supplies .Across the country this winter , generators able to secure adequate fuel supplies received \" maximum generation \" instructions and were ordered to generate flat out - above their normal operational limits - to offset outages elsewhere .The winter of 2013/14 posed a severe test for U.S. gas and electricity networks .On this occasion , the system was able to cope , just .Remarkably , no customer with guaranteed power supply ( \" firm load \" ) had to be disconnected during the winter cold , though the system came worryingly close to rolling blackouts on a number of occasions .But the extent of the problems will intensify FERC 's determination to make the gas and electricity industries to coordinate more closely to avoid fuel delivery issues in future .( Editing by William Hardy ) .We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .If you see a comment that you believe is irrelevant or inappropriate , you can flag it to our editors by using the report abuse links .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.1322"}

{"text": "However , an extensive drilling campaign , coupled with a method to heat the heavy crude known as cyclic steam stimulation ( CSS ) , has boosted Tsimiroro 's current estimate to 1.7 billion barrels of recoverable oil resources , according to the field 's operator Madagascar Oil .Madagascar also holds large oil sands deposits ( petroleum deposits of bitumen also known as tar sands ) .The Bemolanga Project , also situated in the Morondava basin , contains 2 billion barrels of bitumen deposits in place .In 2009 , Total and Madagascar Oil were exploring plans to embark on a capital - intensive mining project to extract the oil , but the companies decided that it would not be economically viable because a low recovery rate of 12 percent was expected .The Manambolo , Morondava , and Manandaza licenses , which are located onshore to the south of Tsimiroro and Bemolanga , are also believed to hold oil and gas resources ranging from 240 to 500 million barrels , according to Madagascar Oil , the owner of the three licenses .Out of the three licenses , the Manandaza is believed to be the most promising because light oil was once discovered ; however , the well was considered non - commercial after only 10 barrels of oil flowed from a very poor reservoir .Madagascar Oil continues to conduct geologic studies on the area to assess its potential .The offshore Morondava basin is also believed to contain large untapped deposits of hydrocarbons , according to an assessment by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) .USGS estimates that the mean technically recoverable resources that are undiscovered in the offshore Morondava basin are : 10.8 billion barrels of oil , 167 Tcf of natural gas , and 5 billion barrels of natural gas liquids .Oil production outlook .Madagascar Oil expects to start small - scale production at the Tsimiroro field sometime in 2013 as part of a steam flood pilot project .Heavy crude oil production from the pilot project is anticipated to peak at the end of 2013 or early 2014 at 1,200 bbl / d .The purpose of the 25-well pilot project is to test the commerciality of the field under a steam - flood recovery method in which steam will be used to heat the oil underground and change its viscosity before it is extracted .The steam - flood method is expected to deliver a recovery factor of about 70 percent , which is much higher than the CSS recovery factor of around 16 percent , according to Madagascar Oil .Assuming that the pilot program is successful , Madagascar Oil anticipates commercial oil production at Tsimiroro will commence in 2019 and eventually ramp up to its peak production of 150,000 - 160,000 bbl / d .The company estimates that the cost of fully developing the field will be $ 1.5 billion , most of which will go towards building an export terminal on site , a pipeline to transport the oil to the coast , a marine terminal , and an offshore mooring facility .Tsimiroro 's production profile and development costs will most likely be revised once the steam - flood pilot project is completed and Madagascar Oil has a clearer picture of the field 's potential .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.04765"}
