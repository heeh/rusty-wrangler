' ' The buck stops at the President .While this committee has been far more successful in obtaining relevant records than any other previous investigation , its painstaking efforts have met with obstruction from President Clinton 's staff at every turn .As a result , in some areas the committee 's investigation is still inconclusive .Since the firings and especially since the 1994 elections , the White House Counsel 's office hired a team of lawyers for a major damage control operation which we have concluded focused on withholding from the committee documents related to Harry Thomason , Mrs. Clinton and President Clinton .In January 1995 , Congressman Clinger became the chairman of the new House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and announced that a thorough investigation into the growing Travel Office scandal would be undertaken .Three hearings had been held and subpoenas were issued when documents suddenly materialized inside the White House that previously had been subpoenaed by other bodies and requested by the committee .On March 9 , 1996 , the U.S. House of Representatives by voice vote adopted House Resolution 369 which authorized committee staff to take depositions pursuant to a subpoena in the White House Travel Office matter .The committee has deposed 72 witnesses , informally interviewed 23 witnesses , obtained 58,734 documents from the White House and approximately 45,000 documents from the Justice Department , Treasury Department and other agencies .The committee was determined to ensure that the Clinton administration did not succeed in its attempt to derail this Travel Office investigation , as it had with every preceding investigation .Unfortunately , the committee found that issuance of subpoenas was not sufficient to ensure the production of all relevant records .It became necessary for the committee to take the rare action , holding White House Counsel John M. Quinn in contempt of Congress on May 9 , 1996 by the committee .It was only after scheduling a May 30 , 1996 , House floor vote on the Resolution that the White House turned over 1,000 pages over which it initially had asserted were ' ' subject to ' ' executive privilege .However , the White House continued to withhold 2,000 pages of documents .President Clinton asserted a blanket claim of executive privilege , stalling for time throughout the summer of 1996 .The White House Counsel 's Office / Chief of Staff 's Sherburne ' ' team ' ' finally provided the committee with access to the 2,000 pages of overly - redacted documents only when a second threat of a House floor vote on contempt of Congress was made .Only at that point did President Clinton finally relinquish the outstanding subpoenaed documents to the committee on August 15 , 1996 .A date calculated to attract the least attention from the media as it was the same evening that Senator Dole accepted the Republican nomination for President .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.637833"}

{"text": "However the pundits did not predict what has actually happened .Voters are telling pollsters that Clinton won , but an increasing number want Sanders to win the nomination .With the first Democratic debate in the books , a new CNN / ORC poll finds most who watched think Hillary Clinton had the best performance of the night , but her strong showing has n't boosted her standing in the race for the party 's nomination ... .Compared with pre - debate polling , Sanders ' support is up five points since mid - September , but no other candidate showed significant change .Gravis Marketing similarly found that a majority thought Clinton won the debate , but also that Sanders pulled within eight points of Clinton nationally - overall a favorable outcome for Sanders .Clinton is welcome to accumulate debate points if Sanders is picking up voters .Sanders holds a 38 - 30 percent lead over Clinton in the first - in - the - nation primary state , while Biden draws 19 percent in the poll of 403 likely Democratic primary voters conducted immediately after last week 's debate .Sanders ' 8-point lead is essentially unchanged from the 44 - 37 percent advantage the Vermont senator held in a stunning Franklin Pierce - Herald poll in August - the first to show the former Secretary of State behind in New Hampshire .The new poll also has Sanders holding an even bigger 10-point lead over Clinton if Biden is n't in the presidential field .The results suggest Clinton will have a tough time overcoming the deficit , as more than half of notoriously finicky Granite State voters now say they have made up their minds .Seven in 10 Sanders supporters say they 've made a \" firm choice \" to vote for him , a 26 percent increase from the last Franklin Pierce - Herald poll in August .And 62 percent of Clinton backers now report they 're firmly in her column , compared to just 40 percent in August .This does show that the pundits who claimed that Clinton was once again unbeatable after the first debate got it wrong .Beyond that , I would n't believe any predictions that the polls today will accurately predict what will happen when people turn out to vote .If you need an example of that , check out this report from December 2007 describing how Clinton has a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Polls in a primary battle mean very little , and a single debate will not decide the nomination .Nothing is even close to getting settled until people start to vote , and ignore those pundits who tell you otherwise .A lead in the national polls is especially meaningless as these often change dramatically afte the results of the first contests are known .Strong performances by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire can totally redefine the race .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.443886"}

Holder Jr. and Robert S. Mueller III , the FBI director .Both men have declined to comment .FBI agents interviewed Broadwell for the first time the week of Oct. 21 , and she acknowledged the affair , a government official briefed on the matter said .She also voluntarily gave the agency her computer .In a search of it , the agents discovered several classified documents , which raised the additional question of whether Petraeus had given them to her .She said that he had not .Agents interviewed Petraeus the following week .He also admitted to the affair but said he had not given any classified documents to her .The agents then interviewed Broadwell again on Nov. 2 , the official said .Based on that record , law - enforcement officials decided there was no evidence that Petraeus had committed any crime and tentatively ruled out charges coming out of the investigation , the official said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.448395"}

Joe Sestak may well come down to his hometown , the city that launched his long political career in 1965 , when he was elected district attorney - as a Republican .In a response to President Bush 's weekly radio address yesterday , Democratic congressional candidate Joe Sestak urged the Bush administration to \" speak honestly \" about the true cost of the war in Iraq .Labeling himself an underdog in an increasingly bitter race , U.S. Rep.

Internal Revenue Code 6103 The committee attempted to determine what precipitated the highly unusual 1-day turnaround from the publication of a news article to a full - blown audit of a company that had not yet filed its first income tax return .However , that attempt was stymied by Internal Revenue Code Section 6103 .For good reason , Section 6103 makes it a crime to disclose tax records and tax return material without the proper authorities .Yet , the president of UltrAir and his attorneys provided several successive 6103 waivers to committee staff precisely because they hoped the committee 's investigation would uncover the impetus of the IRS ' audit .Each successive 6103 waiver form was completed with scrupulous attention to requirements dictated by various representatives of the IRS and the Treasury Department .In the end , the committee was informed that the IRS was ' ' not comfortable ' ' with releasing the requested information .The committee does not believe ' ' not comfortable ' ' is a legal term of art which justifies the withholding of materials an individual or corporate tax citizen wishes to be released .Section 6103 , at the same time it prevents previous abuses , may shield IRS abuses from proper congressional oversight .Without the ability to review relevant tax records pursuant to UltrAir 's own waiver , too many questions still remain unanswered .In her June 30 , 1993 , Tax Notes Today article entitled : ' ' What the IRS Travelgate Report Does and Does Not Say , ' ' Lee A. Sheppard wrote : ' 'Nothing in the redacted IRS report addresses the exquisite timing of the IRS visit to UltrAir .It seems to be more than coincidental . ' ' \\492\\ She concluded : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\492\\ Lee A. Sheppard , What the IRS Travelgate Report Does and Does Not Say , Tax Notes Today , Vol .59 , p. 1743 .As we can not emphasize too often , the IRS is not a free - ranging , all - purpose investigative agency empowered to root out crimes and misdeeds wherever they may occur .At least four people at the IRS had to think that the rough treatment of UltrAir was warranted .\\493\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\493\\ Id. The committee concurs in these remarks , and believes that the answers to these questions , currently sealed behind IRS Code Section 6103 , warrant further attention .Moreover , that executive branch officials were aware of investigations arising from their own false allegations and took no action to inform the investigators , constitutes a reckless abuse of the public trust .Ms. Thomasson reports that ' ' the clients ' ' was how Foster referred to President and Mrs. Clinton .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.234024"}

' ' Even under oath , however , many witnesses have proved less than forthcoming .Many of the key players in the Travel Office case appear to have suffered massive , if specific , memory losses regarding their role in the matter .Unfortunately , this repeats a long - established pattern among senior White House officials and outside advisors to President and Mrs. Clinton .Whether in testimony before Senate or House subcommittees , countless senior advisers acclaimed for their intelligence have no ' ' specific''--or general -- recollection of any matter under review at any given time by the Congress .This is a most troubling pattern which has prevented the Congress from fulfilling its constitutional obligation to oversee the executive branch .This was accomplished by searching each deposition for such key phrases as : ' ' I do n't recall , ' ' ' ' I do n't know , ' ' ' ' I do n't remember ' ' and ' ' I have no recollection . ' ' Slight variations of these phrases also were counted into the totals for each witness .Examples of these include : ' 'Not that I recall , ' ' ' ' Not to my recollection , ' ' ' ' I have no specific recollection , ' ' and so forth .The committee understands it is possible that , over the course of 3\\1/2\\ years , witnesses in fact would forget some details surrounding their involvement in the White House Travel Office matter .Who could n't ' ' recall ' ' Not surprisingly , the worst memory losses were incurred by those nearest to and most responsible for the Travel Office firings and investigation , those who presumably would have the best recollections and greatest access to documents which might refresh their recollections .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.345436"}

{"text": "I. Summary Overview Travelgate is a story about the failure of the Clinton White House to live up to the ethical standards expected of the highest office in the land .The wrongdoing of this administration lies not in the firings of the seven Travel Office employees .They served at the pleasure of the President .If the President chose to fire them to reward political cronies , that was his prerogative .And he must reap the consequences .Rather , the wrongdoing occurred after the firings .It resulted from a desire to hide the truth about who actually fired them and why .The committee spent 3\\1/2\\ years investigating not just who fired them and why , but the wrongdoing that followed .The resulting mosaic pieced together from the facts uncovered reveals the answers the White House refused to disclose .In the end , the actions of the Clinton administration following the firings may have a lasting and damaging impact on the Office of the Presidency .The committee has found that the motive for the firings was political cronyism : the President sought to reward his friend , Harry Thomason , with the spoils of the White House travel business .A pretext for the firings was created , and the trigger was pulled .When the public reacted to the firing with outrage , the roles of the President , First Lady and Thomason were minimized as the White House staff engaged in a colossal damage - control effort .First , it had to portray the victims of the firings as the wrongdoers .This was achieved by White House officials unleashing the full powers of the Federal Government against the seven former workers .The extraordinary might of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice -- not to mention the prestige of the White House itself -- all were brought to bear .These actions constitute a gross abuse of the rights of seven American citizens and their families .Second , an enormous and elaborate cover - up operation , housed in the White House Counsel 's Office , sought to prevent numerous investigations from discovering not only the roles of who fired the workers and why , but also their efforts to persecute the victims .As a result , it is the committee 's view that the White House stands in contempt of its own constitutional responsibilities to faithfully uphold and execute the Constitution and laws of the Nation .Never before has a President and his staff done so much to cover up improper actions and hinder the public 's right to learn the truth .The following chapters reveal the facts that tell this story .Before long , Bill Clinton , who campaigned on the mantra , ' ' I feel your pain , ' ' caused a great deal of pain in the lives of seven career Government employees as well as countless others caught up in the events known as ' 'Travelgate .

{"text": "The above electoral map prediction from Western Illinois University has received a lot of attention , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders , for showing Sanders winning in a landslide .Some argue that we should take this seriously because the mock election model has been right in every election it was used in since 1975 .The catch is that it was only used three times since 1975 .They deserve some credit for correctly predicting victories for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford before many people had heard of Carter , and for predicting the election of Obama when many were ( as with Sanders now ) claiming he was unelectable .While I would love for this to be true , it is also very hard to accept the results in specific states , such as Sanders winning Mississippi and Georgia but losing in Hawaii and Maryland .Of course the claims of being right are limited to the final results and not accuracy of state by state predictions .A victory for Sanders , even if closer and involving a different set of states , would still be welcome .It is easy to dismiss this prediction , and I could not blame either Clinton or the Republicans for denying any meaning to it beyond the enthusiasm of college students for Sanders .The bigger question this year is whether we can believe the conventional polls , especially when they are being used to determine who qualifies for the debates , which can potentially influence the outcome .Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie have been eliminated from Tuesday 's main debate , along with George Pataki and Lindsay Graham being excluded from the undercard debate .Even some pollsters have argued that the polls should not be used in this manner .One problem is that the Republican candidates are too close together to use the polls to separate them .Then there is the question of whether the polls are all that accurate in predicting a primary election well before the vote .I 've followed the Democratic primaries far more closely , and have noted many times how little predictive value the polls have .This polling report from December 2007 described how Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Among the problems with these polls , many voters in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire do not decide until the last minute .People are far more likely to switch between relatively similar members of their own party than they are to switch from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican in a general election .Pollsters also adjust the raw results based upon projections as to who will actually vote , but that is difficult to predict .Some polls this year are basing their prediction upon whether someone voted in previous Democratic primaries , but this excludes the people are who , at least from discussions on line , are saying they have just recently registered to vote Democratic in order to vote for Sanders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.00812"}

Bush presidency .When we look at Figure 1 we can see that naming popularity seems to be heavily affected by First Ladies .Most names experienced a steady downward trend in popularity .The name \" Rosalynn \" is an exception as it peaked in popularity during the Carter administration before falling by the end to have risen in popularity once again .The name \" Hillary \" is very unique in this pattern as unlike most names , it was growing rapidly in popularity prior to the Clinton administration .However , early into the Clinton administration the popularity dropped rapidly falling to pre-1980s levels for the name .Except for a small rally in during the 2007/2008 primary campaign against Obama , it has not recovered .While this is certainly quite silly and does n't necessarily mean anything , it 's strange to think about how many American girls could have potentially been named Hillary if Bill Clinton had lost the 1992 election .Analysis : Governors Soar , Rubio Stumbles Early On in Crucial NH Debate .Saturday , February 6 .By Guy Benson .MANCHESTER , NH --In desperate need of a strong showing in New Hampshire , three Republican governors stepped up and won tonight 's debate .Jeb Bush , Chris Christie and John Kasich all turned in outstanding performances , which may disrupt the state of play ahead of Tuesday 's votes .In a cycle that has been notably unkind to governors , these chief executives finally broke through .Marco Rubio , surging out of Iowa , endured a brutal opening segment , getting sliced and diced by Christie .The New Jerseyan attacked Rubio as scripted and untested , which Rubio parried well at first , but then proceeded to repeat almost the same verbatim defense of himself as Christie poked and prodded .With each similar Rubio response , Christie urged the audience to take note of how the Floridian was confirming the knock the governor was advancing .This was Christie the prosecutor , puncturing a reluctant witness on the stand : .A cringeworthy stretch for Rubio .Let 's see if he suffers because of it .I should add that Rubio rebounded quite well later in the program , offering excellent and detailed answers on a host of questions -- particularly in exchanges on ISIS and abortion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.427826"}
