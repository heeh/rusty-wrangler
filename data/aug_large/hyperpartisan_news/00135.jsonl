Greg Abbott is paying for virtually all of his travel with political contribution money .Abbott 's latest campaign finance report , released Thursday , shows that he spent nearly $ 147,000 on chartered planes and airline tickets in the first six months of the year .Spokesman Matt Hirsch said the Republican governor uses state planes and resources only when traveling to the scene of natural disasters , such as the Blanco River flooding in Central Texas in May. \" In a longstanding commitment of limiting the expenditure of taxpayer dollars and promoting transparency , Governor Abbott uses non - state funds to cover expenses , \" Hirsch said .Earlier this week , when Abbott traveled to New York City on an economic development mission , he had his expenses paid by TexasOne .Former Gov. Rick Perry used the nonprofit corporation to pay for many of his business - recruitment trips .Hirsch said this week 's was the first trip Abbott let TexasOne underwrite .Abbott listed at least $ 146,850 of air travel fees on his semiannual campaign finance report to the Texas Ethics Commission .Of that , 81 percent went to three Austin - based charter air services .Abbott most frequently used Goldsmith Team LLC .When flying commercial , his first choice was Dallas - based Southwest Airlines .Abbott spent nearly $ 21,000 to be free to roam the country on Southwest .He forked over about $ 7,200 to fly United , JetBlue and American , his report shows .Hirsch used a hypothetical to illustrate Team Abbott 's decision to charge his political committee , Texans for Greg Abbott , for most travel .The day after the legislative session ended last month , Abbott flew to Dallas to sign transportation - related measures at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center downtown .While he had no political meetings , if he had shaken hands with a major donor en route to the signing ceremony , that would have been enough to open Abbott up to charges he was politicking on the state dime , Hirsch said .\"In order to avoid any sort of hint of undue use of taxpayer dollars , we always stay above board and pay for his travel with campaign funds , \" he said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.267975"}
