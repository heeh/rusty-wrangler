[ ... ] .[ ... ]The Forgotten Verses of \" The Star - Spangled Banner ... - In 1814 , the poet and lyricist Francis Scott Key penned the lyrics to \" The Star - Spangled Banner , \" originally known as \" Defense of Fort M'Henry . \" ... [ ... ] .I am African and never say african - American because of things like this .I read this when I was young and asked the teacher about the part where it say there is no refuge for the hierling or the slave .She was white and was very surprised that someone actually has read all the way through the song .I will never stand while this song is being played .In the context of the time , this song using the terms \" Hireling or slave \" is not only referring to one particular race .It is referring to anyone fighting for or representing the english during the war of 1812 .This includes white , black , brown , tan , red , and probably other skin colors as well .So Knowledge , you choose not to call yourself an american based on the fact that slavery existed in this country in the past .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.1015"}

Ferguson ) challenging the constitutionality of separate but equal policies .It went all the way to the supreme court where Plessy and his cohorts lost their case .Despite challenges such as Plessy v. Ferguson Jim Crow laws would remain in effect until 1965 when the Civil Rights Movement finally brought about the most dramatic stride in attaining equal status for African Americans with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and The Voting Rights Act in 1965 .The End of Segregation and the Civil Rights Era .This essay is an example of a student 's work .Disclaimer .Throughout the Jim Crow era there was pressure to achieve greater equality between blacks and whites mainly through litigation .This push for desegregation began to heighten in the mid 1950 's when civil rights activists began to employ more direct forms of protest .Mass protests , civil disobedience , and continued legal challenges to segregation laws helped to propel the United States toward a new era of equality .There were many factors that led to the start of the civil rights movement starting in the early 1900 's .An important contributing factor was the migration of African Americans from rural areas in the south to urban and industrial centers throughout the country .This migration was spurred primarily by higher wage jobs and the promise of better social conditions including the right to vote .In the north blacks were able to attain more prominent positions in the community , positions which offered them opportunities to advance the civil rights cause in many areas of the country .Even African Americans in the South began to move to urban centers where they were better able to organize against segregation .By the mid 1950 's significant changes were beginning to come about .Plessy v. Ferguson was overturned , along with another case regarding segregation in schools .Perhaps the most famous ruling of the Civil Rights Era was Brown v. Board of Education .This ruling not only brought about the desegregation of schools but also spurred the end of segregation as an institution .As the 1960 's were ushered in widespread protests , boycotts , and civil disobedience brought about massive changes .Schools from elementary to universities were integrated , voting rights were restored , and discrimination in housing , employment , and other institutions was outlawed .Though the gains made were significant , they did not come without opposition , struggle , and setbacks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.20448"}

Ferguson ) challenging the constitutionality of separate but equal policies .It went all the way to the supreme court where Plessy and his cohorts lost their case .Despite challenges such as Plessy v. Ferguson Jim Crow laws would remain in effect until 1965 when the Civil Rights Movement finally brought about the most dramatic stride in attaining equal status for African Americans with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and The Voting Rights Act in 1965 .The End of Segregation and the Civil Rights Era .This essay is an example of a student 's work .Disclaimer .Throughout the Jim Crow era there was pressure to achieve greater equality between blacks and whites mainly through litigation .This push for desegregation began to heighten in the mid 1950 's when civil rights activists began to employ more direct forms of protest .Mass protests , civil disobedience , and continued legal challenges to segregation laws helped to propel the United States toward a new era of equality .There were many factors that led to the start of the civil rights movement starting in the early 1900 's .An important contributing factor was the migration of African Americans from rural areas in the south to urban and industrial centers throughout the country .This migration was spurred primarily by higher wage jobs and the promise of better social conditions including the right to vote .In the north blacks were able to attain more prominent positions in the community , positions which offered them opportunities to advance the civil rights cause in many areas of the country .Even African Americans in the South began to move to urban centers where they were better able to organize against segregation .By the mid 1950 's significant changes were beginning to come about .Plessy v. Ferguson was overturned , along with another case regarding segregation in schools .Perhaps the most famous ruling of the Civil Rights Era was Brown v. Board of Education .This ruling not only brought about the desegregation of schools but also spurred the end of segregation as an institution .As the 1960 's were ushered in widespread protests , boycotts , and civil disobedience brought about massive changes .Schools from elementary to universities were integrated , voting rights were restored , and discrimination in housing , employment , and other institutions was outlawed .Though the gains made were significant , they did not come without opposition , struggle , and setbacks .The assassinations of John F. Kennedy in 1963 and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 were major blows , however the groundwork they helped to lay ultimately led to the continued success of the movement .In addition to these losses civil rights activists and the African American population as a whole continued to suffer injustices at the hand of whites in power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.270035"}

NFL , 41 F.3d 402 ( 1994 ) , was brought by NFL players as a result of the deceritification .This lawsuitultimately ended the six - year labor dispute , resulted in a new collective bargaining agreement and brought about the reemergence of the NFLPA .The collective bargaining agreement entered into between the NFL and NFLPA in 1993 was extended five times and expired on March 3 , 2011 .On March 11 , 2011 , the NFLPA decertified , which led to the NFL locking out its players .Subsequently , two antitrust lawsuits have been filed on behalf of former players of the NFLPA .While there has been some interesting legal proceedings in these cases , including Judge Susan Nelson 's invalidation of the lockout ( Brady v.
