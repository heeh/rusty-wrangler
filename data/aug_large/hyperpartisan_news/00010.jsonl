{"text": "Using a plastic card does not provide an automatic cooling - off period , or always allow the payment to be countermanded later .So consumers are likely to be disappointed if , for example , they use a plastic card to place an order for goods , in the expectation that they will be able to cancel the payment if they subsequently change their mind .However , the position is different if : . the goods or services are paid for ( or partly paid for ) with a credit card .the cost is over \u00a3 100 and not more than \u00a3 30,000 ; and .there is either a misrepresentation ( a false statement of fact ) or a breach of contract by the supplier .In such cases , consumers may be able to rely on their legal rights under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 .This gives consumers the same right to claim against the provider of credit as they would have against the supplier .So consumers may be able to recover the same amount that they paid with their card - or more , or less , than that sum .Another common belief is that pursuing a claim for a refund through the credit provider is a last resort and that consumers must first have : . brought legal proceedings against the supplier . obtained a judgment ; and .tried to enforce it .In fact , there is no such requirement .If a consumer is misled on that point by their credit card provider , and then spends time and money on unnecessary legal proceedings , they will be entitled to compensation for that ( as happened in case 78/01 below ) .However , it is important to note that claims can only be made under section 75 where the payment was made using a credit card .Other types of plastic card payments ( for example , debit cards or charge cards ) are not covered by section 75 .Consumers and card issuers can sometimes get confused on this point , as we illustrate in case 78/02 .The contracts that card issuers have with their card network providers are likely to have provisions that - in certain circumstances - allow card issuers to attempt what are known as \" chargebacks \" .If successful , a chargeback allows a card issuer to claim back a payment from the retailer 's bank , on the consumer 's behalf .However , the provisions allowing chargebacks are not consumer rights provided by law .And the terms of the contracts - including the grounds on which a chargeback may be attempted - vary from network to network .Consumers are not generally aware of the circumstances in which a chargeback might be attempted .However , we expect card issuers ( who should understand the terms and conditions of their own contracts with the network providers ) to consider making a chargeback claim if the consumer has made them aware of a situation where this might be appropriate .Chargeback attempts are not guaranteed to succeed , and card issuers can not force suppliers ' banks to refund money paid by plastic card .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.26033"}

{"text": "So it is important that the card issuer makes it clear to the consumer that their card account may be re - debited if the supplier 's bank does not agree to the chargeback .There are time limits for attempting a chargeback , and we would expect the card issuer to bear that in mind if a consumer contacts it about a situation that might entail a chargeback request .This is what happened in case 78/04 below .Sometimes the consumer has made the plastic card payment through a third - party payment processor , rather than direct to the retailer .This is quite common in purchases made from online retailers .In such cases the consumer / credit provider / supplier chain that is required to bring a claim under section 75 may be broken - and the card issuer 's right to attempt a chargeback may also be affected .Finally , in some of the cases that we see , the consumer argues that they did not give their consent for the total amount that the retailer charged to the card .Irrespective of whether there could be a claim under section 75 or the chance of a successful chargeback , the consumer may have grounds for recovering the payment from their card issuer .Case 78/05 provides an example of a consumer who was partly successful with a complaint of this type .issue 78 index of case studies .78/1 - credit card provider tells consumer to take legal action when retailer fails to deliver a purchase made by credit card .78/2 - consumers ask their bank to refund plastic card payment made for mail - order purchase .78/3- consumer complains about bank 's refusal to help her recover plastic card payments .78/4- consumer says bank failed to give sufficient help to recover debit card payment made abroad .78/5 - customer authorises debit card payment made over the phone but says an incorrect amount was debited from his account .78/01 credit card provider tells consumer to take legal action when retailer fails to deliver a purchase made by credit card .Soon after he retired from his job as a farm labourer , Mr M bought a new bed from a local furniture showroom .He paid \u00a3 450 , using his credit card , and was told that the bed would be delivered within four weeks .However , this date was put back several times .He was still waiting for the bed to arrive six months later , when a neighbour told him that the furniture showroom had closed down .Unable to get more than a recorded message when he rang the showroom , Mr M contacted his credit card provider .He explained what had happened and said he wanted to reclaim the \u00a3 450 .The credit card provider told him he would probably get his money back .But it said he would first have to take legal action against the company that owned the furniture showroom and get a court judgment in his favour .Mr M was alarmed to learn this and asked if there was any other way in which he could get his money back .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.41237"}
