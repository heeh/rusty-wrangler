{"text": "Mercury .Estimated Population At Risk At Identified Sites : . 8.6 Million People .Estimated Global Impact : . 15 to 19 Million People .Introduction .Mercury is a heavy metal that has significant impacts on human health .Mercury comes in three forms- metallic , inorganic , and organic - each with its own degree of toxicity and particular exposure pathways .Metallic mercury is the pure elemental form of the metal , and is extracted from cinnabar ore .Another primary form of the metal is organic mercury , most commonly known as methylmercury , and produced when elemental mercury combines with carbon .This is the form of the pollutant that can contaminate food chains .Mercury naturally enters the environment through the breakdown of minerals into soil , which is then dispersed through the movement of air and water .Since the start of the industrial revolution in the 18th century , the release of mercury into the environment has been heavily amplified .Currently , the anthropogenic release of mercury accounts for up to two - thirds of the total mercury in the environment .[ 24 ] .Other common sources of mercury pollution in these countries include industrial mining , chemical manufacturing , solid waste disposal , and metals smelting .Most of these activities involve the heating of mercury , which releases it into the air in vapor form .The mercury is then transported in dust by wind .Mercury can settle into soil or surface waters through rainfall , and often is washed away from these sites along with tailings and sediments into local water bodies .Once in an aquatic ecosystem , elemental mercury can be transformed into methylmercury - a powerful neurotoxin - by bacteria , and can bioaccumulate and move up the food chain .People are commonly exposed to mercury through the inhalation of vapors produced through the burning of mercury in these various industrial activities ; however , many are also exposed to methylmercury through the consumption of contaminated food products such as fish .Once mercury enters the human body , it can permanently damage the brain , kidneys , and the development of a fetus .Exposure to methylmercury can cause arthritis , miscarriages , respiratory failure , neurological damage , and even death .Children are most at risk of mercury exposure , especially in regions adjacent to small- and large - scale gold mines .Common Exposure Pathways and Health Risks .Mercury is released into the environment both as a vapor from burning processes and as a liquid that contaminates water and soil .In occupational settings such as mining sites , workers are primarily exposed to elemental mercury in the form of these vapors - it is estimated that around 80 % of exposure to mercury is through this pathway .[ 25 ] People are also exposed to mercury through dermal contact , as the contaminant can be absorbed through the skin .The use of mercury in industrial processes and products also allows small amounts of the heavy metal to contaminate soils and local water bodies .One study of small - scale mining in Peru estimated that one or two grams of mercury were being released into the surrounding environment for every gram of gold produced .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.789547"}

{"text": "While this will precipitate some price spikes , the price sensitivity to increased costs of , for example , the actual use of europium in liquid crystal displays is miniscule and the rare earths therefore remain relatively price- insensitive commodities .It is highly unlikely that that the Chinese dependence on imports supplied by both major and small mining companies for their supply of copper , iron ore , or phosphates and potash will diminish substantially in the near future .The prospects for growth in Chinese demand are much more likely .Of the enormous amounts of metals and minerals produced , copper and iron ore alone represent roughly half of the total value created in global metal mining .Chinese iron ore imports amount to over 500 Mt conservatively valued at US$ 50 billion .But there are also other strategic metals such as phosphates and potash which are crucial for the production of fertilizers and hence for Chinese food supplies and which also need to be taken into consideration in this import dependence scenario .The situation where China is dependent on a limited number of major transnational mining companies will therefore continue to be a much more serious risk for international conflicts in the future than the supply of rare earths .It is also important to appreciate as well that North America , Australia , and Europe have their own interests to protect in Africa and Latin America , and much of the anti - Chinese sentiment is driven by these factors .These countries have enjoyed more - or - less unfettered dominance of the African minerals sector for the most part of the 20th century in sourcing cheap raw materials , so the resistance to Chinese competition from these quarters is understandable .However , from the African experience of Chinese mining investments to date , it is clear that there is a dire need for efficient resource administration in order to manage Chinese investment effectively .In South Africa , for example , Chinese investors are aware of this and have been watching regulatory developments with a great deal of interest and concern .Consequently , there is a tendency for Chinese investors to seek control of their investments in the African mining sector .In conclusion , there are many misconceptions concerning the Chinese imperative to ensure security of supply for resources and hence its interest in African resources .It is , however , of major concern for China that it is not to be able to secure its supply of most of the economically important metals and minerals in the way the ' Western ' countries have been able to do for decades .This said , the perceived threat of China to the ' Western ' interests must be seen in its true context .The attempts by the Chinese to invest in new projects or to take control over established transnational mining companies have evoked strong but unjustified political concern in Australia , Canada , and elsewhere that is essence not supported by global production statistics .While these misconceptions are widespread and more often than not unsubstantiated , they are exacerbated by the lack of clear and transparent statistics from China itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.502533"}

{"text": "What makes gold so valuable ?I recently did some research on gold as part of a commodities study .Did you know that gold is mostly used as a measure of wealth ?According to The U.S. Geologic Survey almost ninety percent of gold production is used to make either jewelry or gold ingots that sit in vaults .Much of the jewelry is used as savings by people in the developing world .In fact , so little gold is used in industrial applications that recycled broken jewelry could easily cover all industrial demand .And even if everyone stopped selling their scrap gold , there are good substitutes for all of gold 's industrial uses .So what is it about gold that makes it so valuable ?It does not provide food , shelter , or clothing , and its industrial uses can all be covered by other substances .When I ask that question people start waxing philosophical about intrinsic value .After all , they remind me , the market sets the price , and everyone knows what it is worth .Only one person , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , has been candid enough to call it what it is .When asked why the United States holds gold reserves he responded \" Well , it 's tradition - long - term tradition .\" When one considers how limited the truly productive uses for gold are , it becomes apparent that gold is wildly overvalued .And yet the price of gold does not nearly reflect its true cost .The best way to understand the cost of gold is to examine gold mining .There are several methods commonly used for mining gold and all of them are very hard on the environment .Most gold \" mining \" these days is done using a process called heap leaching .In heap leaching hundreds of thousands of tons of rock are ground into a fine powder .Bulldozers are then used to pile the powder on top of a plastic liner where it is sprayed with a cyanide solution .The solution is left to leach its way through the pile , after which it is filtered to collect the gold .Heap leaching is done out in the open and accidents do happen .Plastic liners fail under the stress of bulldozer traffic .When the liners hold up , heavy rain often exceeds the capacity of the liner and cyanide solution is released .There have been numerous incidents where cyanide was released into rivers killing fish and poisoning drinking water .Another problem is that tailings - the piles of powdered rock remaining after leaching - sometimes collapse fouling nearby rivers into which they spill .In one incident , a tailings dam in Baia Mare , Romania collapsed , causing extensive damage to over 1,000 kilometers of river ecosystem .In the Amazon , artisanal miners spend their days shoveling mud into mercury - coated chutes , where minute flakes of gold are absorbed by the mercury , forming a paste .These \" artisans \" then evaporate the mercury with a blow torch to separate the gold , poisoning themselves in the process .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.04895"}

{"text": "\" To tell the truth , the first time I looked out there , I saw a million dollars , \" says Janesville farmer Dave Heider as he watches Miracle , the white buffalo calf held sacred by Native Americans , chew contentedly on a mouthful of silage .\"But once I saw how much this little calf means to so many people , I could n't see charging money for people to come and look at her .I mean , how can you put a price on something that 's sacred and holy ?You know , if God meant for me to be a millionaire , I would have won the lottery . \"Heider and his wife , Val , had been raising buffalo on their 46-acre hobby farm for less than five years when Miracle was born snow white on Aug. 20 .All this has piqued the interest of news and infotainment outlets around the world , including the BBC , CBS News , and People magazine .Naturally , an assortment of wealthy collectors and modern - day Barnums have also shown an interest in the calf .Early on , rock star Ted Nugent , who penned a song about a white buffalo , offered to buy Miracle .But the Heiders have n't tried to make money off the calf .Dave still drives a truck for the county ( he 'll go up to a 16-hour day when the snow begins to fall ) and Val has n't quit her janitor job .To prevent exploitation of the calf by carnival sharks and what the Heiders ' attorney , Dan Varline , calls \" UFO magazines , \" both Miracle 's image and name have been copyrighted .( Isthmus had to sign an agreement prohibiting broader use in order to photograph the calf . )The Heiders knew from contacts in the bison industry that their calf was unusual ; in fact , the Wisconsin Farmer and The Beloit Daily News both did stories about its birth .But it was only after the story got wider distribution that they learned Miracle was held sacred by buffalo - hunting Plains Indians ; including the Lakota and the Cheyenne .\" The story hit the news wire on Wednesday and the first Native Americans were here on Thursday , \" recalls Heider .\" I think they were Oneida .They came from Black River Falls .We were up by the calf with some people and these Native Americans had been waiting for an hour , an hour and half .They asked our permission to see the calf and also pray to it and leave an offering .\" News of the calf spread quickly through the Native American community because its birth fulfilled a 2,000-year - old prophecy of northern Plains Indians .Joseph Chasing Horse , traditional leader of the Lakota nation , explains that 2,000 years ago a young woman who first appeared in the shape of a white buffalo gave the Lakota 's ancestors a sacred pipe and sacred ceremonies and made them guardians of the Black Hills .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "129.3563"}
