Security Council resolutions .This while the North Korean regime remains openly defiant of the international community despite countless attempts to reach a diplomatic resolution .How did North Korea get nuclear weapons ?Hot Air explains how the North Korea deal was presented to the American people by Bill Clinton and his allies in the left - wing news media ( note how similar it is to the way that Obama raved about his deal with Iran ) : .\" This is a good deal for the United States , \" said President Clinton . \"North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program .South Korea and our other allies will be better protected .The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons .\" This whole agreement collapsed in 2002 , when the CIA discovered that North Korea was secretly enriching uranium for further weapons production .You can read about the full chronology for Clinton 's North Korea deal , the subsequent CIA discoveries , and the missile launches that violated the United Nations resolutions .It 's important for young people to know the history of the efforts by Democrats to give goodies to bad actors in the world .It never works , but young people are often not taught about these things in liberal schools .And they do n't do much on their own to find the truth about these issues .Sen.
