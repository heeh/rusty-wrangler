Groeschel , C.F.R . , addresses many questions in his book , The Cross at Ground Zero .He reassures us that the iron cross , found at the world trade center , leads to the cross of Jesus which stands at the center of all pain , all suffering , indeed all history .He explains that Jesus did not come to take away suffering .He came to sanctify suffering by His presence .5 comments : .Al reflected on the 9/11 attack .He talked about the good empty hole ( the tomb ) vs. the bad empty hole ( the WTC complex ) .He then brought up Bill Clinton 's November 7 , 2001 speech at Georgetown University .According to Al , \" [ Clinton ] suggested that America 's own arrogant self - righteousness was partly to blame for making the nation a target for terrorism .Fine .If he wants to see this as a form of judgment , that 's fine .\" Al does n't really think Clinton 's \" suggestion \" was fine .But let 's move on .Here 's what Clinton said at the end of his speech : \" You can have the most exciting time in human history , but we have to defeat people who think they can find their redemption in our destruction .Then we have to be smart enough to get rid of our arrogant self - righteousness so that we do n't claim for ourselves things that we deny for others .If we do that , you will still live in the best time the world has ever known .\" I read Clinton 's speech to find out if he did in fact see the attack as \" a form of judgment .\" The best I could find was at the beginning of the speech .Clinton recounted historical injustices , and said that these injustices may have lingering bad effects .Clinton 's grave error , of course , was to refer only to injustices by the Christian West .He emphasized to the students that \" European lineages are not blameless . \"Clinton cited the first Crusade : the burning of a Jewish synagogue in Jerusalem with 300 Jews inside and the killing of Muslim women and children on the Temple Mount , and saying that we continue to pay a price .He also cited America 's system of slavery and the historical treatment of Native Americans , again saying we still pay a price today .Clinton 's point : ideas and actions have consequences .Al Qaeda 's February 23 , 1998 fatwa gave three reasons for the declaration of a holy war against America and its allies : U.S. occupation of the Arabian Peninsula , the protracted U.S. blockade of Iraq , and U.S. support for Israel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.97629"}

{"text": "The idea of communism - true , non - totalitarian communism - taking place on a large scale in modern or future society actually makes me uneasy .Even if it works for a short period of time or with a small amount of people , human nature will take over and someone will rise to power , or riots will break out and society will spiral into chaotic anarchy .In short : communism and human nature do not coincide .Any patriot could argue that capitalism has worked perfectly for Americans thus far , but upon more thorough analysis this argument is also void .Capitalism can hypothetically give a person the power to shape their life as they please - if they take the right risks and are born with certain benefits .Much talk has aired of the \" Occupy Wall Street \" protest , bringing light to \" the 99 % \" of Americans who are burdened with the struggle to make a living .Frugality is no longer a savior to these people , but a lifestyle .Capitalism , under most circumstances , gives the strategic entrepreneur all the benefits and the average person little to nothing .I wholeheartedly agree with Megan 's point of view .There is no \" best \" or \" ultimate \" form of government yet known to society .This may be because governmental morals , especially those of democratic nature , are relatively new and still developing .( After all , quite a few countries are still yet to turn to democracy ) .It is also possible that - quite plainly - no one has thought of the best idea yet .But in my opinion , it is most likely that no one form of government will ever be the perfect fit for every country , since every region comes from different historic , political and religious backgrounds different ideas will be accepted and practices in different places .Society 's morals / ideas are ever - changing and never stationary ; therefore the way society is governed must be ever - changing and stationary .That 's why there is no real official approach to deal with the inequalities between the social classes .If we try to spread the wealth and pay everybody equal amounts , then people will get upset because some people work incredibly hard and some other people do n't work as hard .Also I 'm sure that people would n't like having a lot their money talking away just to make a person who does n't have a job as good as their 's happy .The hard workers would be upset and the people who do n't work as hard would be stoked .So unfortunately the idea that Robert Owen believed in would n't really work .Believing trade unions and being a social democrat are goods things because workers should have the right to protest and be protected and keep their jobs .Both those ideas help the social classes issue a little bit because they can keep their jobs and be safe while doing them but it does n't help close the distance between the rich and the poor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.05803"}

The distinction I thought Kevin was making was between oppression and the existence of poor in society and that this passage was addressing the former .My point was that today the issue of oppression is more complex than when this passage was written .Oppression happens as a result of the system we westerners have created and support .You and I may not be intensionally oppressing anyone , but the choices we make as consumers indirectly may be .If we know we can do something about this but we do n't , then surely some measure of guilt lies on us ?For example , if you knew that your favourite brand of sports shoes were made by children working 12 hour days in a sweatshop , would that affect your future choices ?I hope it would .Even in cases where it is genuinely difficult to know ( you cite clothing as an example ) , there are often still alternatives .For example I try as much as possible to buy my clothes second hand from a charity shop .This way , even if the items of clothing itself was manufactured unjustly , I know that my money is not going into the hands of the oppressors ( plus I get nice clothes for a good price ! )This is n't always possible , and I 'm not saying all Christians should do this , it is an example of how there are often ways we can actively \" seek justice and correct oppression \" even through our shopping habits .Just because there are n't easy or quick fix solutions does n't excuse us from doing nothing .Ian , I am in complete agreement with what you are saying .We are all aware in some way that children are working in sweat shops around the world , and our \" efforts to avoid \" the discovery of that truth leads to oppression .By efforts to avoid , I mean that in some way , we all know that our clothing comes from low paid workers , and we avoid finding out how that happens .We all know that there is oppression in the system , to which we are contributing , and we are ignoring it .May the Holy Spirit soften our hearts to lives of those who we do not see .I find the passages on poverty problematic and they have left me quite uncertain on how a Christian should proceed .I agree with you summation of this passage , but Jesus said specifically that he came to preach the good news to the poor .This appeared to be a big thrust in his earthly ministry , so clearly the poor are important to Jesus and should therefore be important to us .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.193596"}

{"text": "My thoughts were in my series on Walking with Christ .Great thoughts , thank you .I am haunted by the idea that we focus on one or the other way too much - and I am coming to the view that thinking about doing social justice works are fine but just as in error as being right and not doing .What happens if we just listen and walk as He leads ?My thoughts were in my series on Walking with Christ .Grey .Errr ...I agree with everything except the title ....Social Justice is about using force to take peoples money and give it to some other people because it is apparently an ' injustice ' to be poor .I.e. total rubbish .The downside of the social justice movement is that the responsibility for dealing with the poor and needy is shifted to a government and away from the individual ( which is why liberals give less to charity than conservatives per person ) .It also fails to generate the moral character in either the giver ( who feels good about paying taxes ? ) or the receiver ( who becomes ' entitled ' to handouts ) , whilst increasing the number of people receiving the handouts ( what you reward , you get more of ) .No small surprise to see the Israelite solution was allowing the poor to harvest their own food , rather than simply giving handouts .As Christians we should be out in the world , helping those in need , but we should not be fooled by value laden , incorrectly named phrases which ultimately will lead to the destruction of western civilisation and the taming of the church ... .Amen and amen .I 've been doing some thinking and writing on this myself lately and have reached the same conclusion .It is the only conclusion , really , when we look at the life of Christ .I like to put it this way : the proclamation of the Gospel is the soundtrack to the demonstration of Christ 's work in us .Good works are of little use when muted and sharing the Gospel lacks impact without flesh and bone .Lindsay Stallones .I 'm afraid I do n't agree .I think you 're using the term ' social justice ' incorrectly .The term was first coined in 1840 by a Jesuit priest , not during the establishment of an American welfare system .In addition , the term encompasses far more than mere income equality - it also refers to addressing issues of discrimination and tackling violations of human rights such as human trafficking .For political gain , both sides of American party politics have narrowed the definition of ' social justice ' , but we should n't capitulate to that .It 's cheap party politics , but the Bible speaks a lot about justice in the social order , and does n't shy away from having the government partner in that work .Neither should we .Steve .Unfortunately , we have seen Christian charity give way to political causes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.444466"}

{"text": "What exactly did Jesus teach regarding the message of the Gospel , and what exactly did Jesus do regarding the needs of the people of His day ?A full explanation would take a full book , but let me see if I can summarize three of the highlights : .The mission and message of Jesus is pretty clearly summarized in Luke 4:18 - 19 .He wants to give sight to the blind , liberty to the captives , and deliverance to the oppressed .If we look at the actions of Jesus throughout the Gospels , He did these things both spiritually and physically .Sometimes Jesus met people 's physical needs before He addressed their spiritual needs , and other times He addressed their spiritual needs first .Jesus was not into free handouts .Yes , Jesus gave free meals and free healthcare to people .But notice a few things about these events .First , the people He is helping are almost always people who are following Him or who have sought Him out in some way .When He feeds the five thousand , it was because they had been listening to His teachings and He had gone on so long that they all became hungry and had not brought any food .The vast majority of these people were not homeless .They were not unemployed .They just forgot to bring food .Later , when word gets around that Jesus was giving free meals , and people started showing up just the free stuff , Jesus pretty much chased them away ( cf .John 6 ) .Jesus never called on the government to provide free stuff .Not once did Jesus ever call on the Roman Empire , or the local Israelite authorities to raise taxes so that the poor and unemployed could be taken care of .Taking care of the poor and needy in the community was a priority of Jesus , but He never saw this as the responsibility of the government .Taking care of the poor and needy in the community was the responsibility of the individual person , or of local groups .So when it comes to Jesus and His Gospel message , I do n't think He would side with either of the two main groups in the social justice debate .On the one hand , helping the poor and needy was indeed a priority for Jesus , and sometimes He helped people whether or not they believed in Him for eternal life and became His followers .Sometimes He helped people just because they needed help .But on the other hand , Jesus was not a proponent of trying to legislate morality , of trying to get people to do what is right through higher taxation and passing laws .Jesus did not put much faith in human government to fix what was wrong with the world .Fixing the world , helping the poor , and defending the oppressed was His job , and the job He passed on to those who follow Him .And fixing what is wrong with the world means looking not just at people 's spiritual needs , but also their mental , emotional , psychological , and physical needs as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.16289"}

{"text": "An example of how a perfect society where everyone shares can not happen is Robert Owen 's idea of a perfect Utopia .His thought was that everyone can live together and share their money and power and that everyone would be equal .He dreamed of a perfect society with an idea of a true communist government .This Utopia crumbled and fell apart very quickly because of humans tendency of controlling everything and having all the wealth and power .The human race can not live in a society of sharing and equality .We are even having trouble with our democracy with people taking all the money and not being taxed for it .So I think that the best way to deal with inequalities between social classes is to crack down on the people who do n't want to play fair and tell them to suck it up and pay the right amount of taxes and be equal with everyone else .But this probably wo n't work and that 's the truth , society will never be able to be completely equal because there will always be that one person that messes up .To me there is no one true perfect form of government .Social structure in itself is a self destructive system that can only operate for so long .Looking over the past there is not one society or form of government that has remained 100 % stable throughout history .There has always been conflict and strife between parties and individuals .But , if a society is put up against class conflict the best way , I think , to handle it is through social democrats .We are said to be all equal and seen just as important as those around us .However , in society today this is definitely not true , there are people with power from many different areas who slip through the cracks of our government by pushing their agendas onto political figures .They work hard , become successful but then try dominating further by obtaining favor through the political process .These special interest groups are what now take away the voice of American people .Going back to being a social democrat , I believe it is a great idea that Congress pass bills providing services to protect workers .I think it is completely fair and just that workers are provided protection and safety they can rely on .But , that 's where I see it becoming shaky .Congress can pass bills and everything but with political leaders being bribed , strongly persuaded , to make changes or other decisions by higher power individuals like company owners , it is hard to feel completely confident about workers ' rights .So in conclusion I agree with Jacob Brown because he is right in saying that if the people in power on Wall Street do not want to be blamed they should let us 99 % have a voice .And that the decisions the government has made have put this country in deep sh . situations .To be equal and have decisions fairly made for all people and workers , the government must protect its loyalty to the country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "128.55925"}

{"text": "But , the libertarian may object , are these problems really issues of justice ?Well , Aristotle distinguishes between \" general \" justice on the one hand and \" special \" or \" particular \" justice on the other .General justice is concerned with interpersonal moral claims in general : it 's the entire interpersonal dimension of morality , \" the whole of virtue in relation to another . \"Special justice obviously corresponds more or less to the realm of libertarian rights , while general justice corresponds to interpersonal morality more generally .Where libertarians most crucially depart from Aristotle is in regarding only special justice as legitimately enforceable , whereas Aristotle also regarded parts ( not all ) of general justice as legitimately enforceable .Still , even Aristotle agreed that some aspects of general justice ( generosity , for example ) are not properly enforceable , and that special justice was especially the concern of law .Now it 's often assumed that libertarians can properly have no use for left - wing concepts of \" economic justice \" and \" social justice . \"So many issues of \" social justice \" can be accepted by libertarians as part of special justice .Now it may still be true that some issues of \" social justice \" go beyond libertarian rights and so beyond special justice .But these may still properly be regarded as issues of justice if they fall under general justice .Even in cases where treating one 's employees like crap violates no libertarian rights and so should not be legally actionable , for example , it still violates interpersonal moral claims and so may be regarded as in this broader sense an issue of justice .Thus there 's no reason whatever for libertarians to surrender the concept of social justice to the statist left , or to let the concept stand as an obstacle to cooperation with the not necessarily or not irretrievably statist left .3 responses to \" Proletarian Blues \" .F.A. Hayek did not , normally , argue that the concept of Social Justice was \" meaningless \" .He , quite correctly , pointed out that the concept of Social Justice was not compatible with the traditional concept of justice .I agree that Hayek 's use of the word \" mirage \" in his attack on Social Justice is unfortunate - for it implies ( as does some of his other language ) that Social Justice is meaningles ( an idea without concrete substance ) .However , it is clear that Hayek ( just like Oakeshot , Antony Flew and so on ) understands the Social Justice is not an illusion - it is a very real idea(not an illusion or a \" mirage \" ) , but also an evil idea .Evil because it presents the state ( or the collective by some other name if people do not like the word \" state \" ) as the parent , and the population as little children .With the Daddy or Mummy state ( or some other word ) \" distributing \" income and wealth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "136.77774"}
