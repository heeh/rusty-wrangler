{"text": "If it were internalized by a Romney administration , it would be a step in the right direction .Still , the essay goes awry in significant ways .Let 's start with the authors ' intimation that \" religious fanaticism \" causes terrorism .To be sure , that 's a better explanation than the Left 's \" blame America first \" approach .Yet , it still misses the mark .The real cause is ideology , not religion .The distinction is worth drawing because , for the most part , Islamist terror is not fueled by Muslim zealousness for Islam 's religious tenets - for instance , \" the oneness of Allah .\" We Westerners recognize such beliefs as belonging to the realm of religion or spirituality .To the contrary , Islamist terror is driven by the supremacism and totalitarianism of Middle Eastern Islam - i.e. , by the perception of believers that they are under a divine injunction to impose all of Islam 's tenets .Most of those tenets do not concern religion or spirituality , at least not as Westerners interpret those concepts .Instead , sharia is largely concerned with controlling what we see as secular affairs - political , social , military , financial , jurisprudential , penal , even hygienic matters .Of course , the fact that we separate church and state in the West does not mean our moral sense is without influence - indeed , profound influence - over how we conduct secular affairs .But in the West , we reject the notion that any religious belief system 's tenets should control those affairs .In the United States , we reject the establishment of a state religion - such official primacy would suffocate freedom of conscience , a bedrock of liberty .By contrast , the foundation of Middle Eastern Islam is submission to Allah 's law , not individual liberty .This interpretation of Islam thus rejects a division between the secular and the spiritual .Its sharia system contemplates totalitarian control .That makes Islamist ideology ( i.e. , Islamic supremacism , or what is sometimes more elliptically called \" political Islam \" ) just another totalitarian ideology , albeit one that happens to have a religious veneer .Some of my friends make the error of claiming that \" Islam is not a religion .\" I understand what they mean - it is a clumsy way of making the point that mainstream Islam aspires to control much more than spiritual life .Still , the clumsy rhetoric is a bad mistake , driving a wedge between what should be natural allies : those fearful of Islamic supremacism and religious believers .The latter - for example , American Christians , Jews , and non - Islamist Muslims - today find their core liberties under siege by government overreach and atheist hostility .How convenient for these aggressor forces if , by the hocus - pocus of denying an established creed the status of religion , its adherents may be stripped of their constitutional protections .No , Islam clearly is a religion , and its theological tenets are every bit as deserving of the First Amendment 's guarantees as any other .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "37.467567"}

{"text": "However , a tendency to regard Ali and the subsequent Imams as the continuation of prophecy , and as Muhammad 's near equals in this regard , subsequently emerged among the adherents of Ali .In time , this was more formally articulated in one of Shiism 's central tenets mentioned above : the belief in the perfect wisdom and moral infallibility of the Imams .However , it is believed among Shia that Ali and his heirs did enjoy the same privileged access to wisdom and understanding that Muhammad had , including the privileged understanding of the law .This understanding of the status of Ali and his rightful heirs appears to have been first directly articulated by the Sixth Imam , Jaafar as - Sadik , who died in 765 .In the course of general Shiite history - though not Twelver Shiite history - even the remaining distinction between Muhammad and the Imams was sometimes breached .At certain times , for instance , radical Shiite groups emerged and attributed to the Imam that they recognized the right of the lawgiver .The leaders of these movements were thus capable of promulgating a new law , as well as of rescinding the old law .At all events , all forms of Shiism in effect affirm not only Ali 's unique right to rule but tend to understand rightful Islamic rule as a kind of continuation of prophetic rule .But as has been frequently said , Shiism involves not only a different political doctrine but a different religious sensibility , which receives powerful expression in its distinctive rites such as Ashura .This is , in part , a reflection of the unhappy experience of Ali 's partisans in adhering to and advancing their distinctive view of political and religious leadership .In the aftermath of Muhammad 's death , and during roughly the first century of the new Islamic empire , Ali 's unique claim to the caliphate did not achieve political success .His partisans necessarily regarded the rulers of the early Muslim empire as illegitimate .Moreover , they mounted relatively frequent attempts to overturn these rulers , all of which ultimately ended in defeat .The experience of these defeats served to aggravate Shiite indignation with the principled injustice of the denial of Alid rule .This provided Shiism with a sensibility of grievance and the longing for a redress of the series of injustices to which the Alids had been victims .These injustices began with the fate of Ali himself , and with the circumstances surrounding his rule as caliph .For Ali did in fact become caliph , though only after three other men held that office - Abu Bakr , Omar and Uthman .Ali succeeded them as the 4th caliph in 656 .If by strict Shiite principle even this delay was an injustice , it was the sad fate of Ali and his caliphate which , historically speaking , launched and inflamed Shiite sensibility .These circumstances , and the historical aftermath of the 1st century of Islam , thus require a brief elaboration .Although today all Sunni and Shiite Muslims recognize Ali as a rightful caliph , this was not the case at the time he assumed office as caliph .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.80936"}

{"text": "The Khomeinist Deterrence The Iranian revolution of 1979 is sometimes portrayed as representing a break with the traditional Shiite quietism .It is true that when Iran 's revolutionary rumblings began in the fall of 1978 , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini played every card in his hand to rally the masses against Shah Reza Pahlavi - including the use of subtle messianic references .Subsequently , Khomeini accepted the prestigious title of imam and even allowed his followers to indulge in messianic rhetoric .In one notorious example , Khomeini did not disavow the collective hallucination of November 27 , 1978 when thousands of his followers claimed to have seen Khomeini 's face in the moon .Since coming to power , however , the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran have generally sought to proscribe , or to at least deter , political messianism within their realm .In fact , as a matter of principle Khomeini adamantly opposed political mahdism : His break with the traditional Shiite clergy came not on the issues of messianism , but on the question of political power .During his exile from 1966 to 1978 in Najaf , Iraq , Khomeini developed his political doctrine of velayat - e - faqih , or rule of the Islamic jurist , while the Shiite clerical hierarchy based in Qom continued to advocate a centuries - old separation of religious and political authority .After the fall of the shah in February 1979 , the Islamic Republic was formed around a constitution that described its supreme leader as a representative of the Hidden Imam .This delegation of supernatural power to the head of state was in line with the dynastical legitimacy instituted by the Safavids .While the ayatollahs in Qom resented this confusion of powers , they shared Khomeini 's dislike for messianic excesses .No individual or sect had the right to challenge the occultation or decipher the signs .This was the privilege of the religious hierarchy , which prohibited any messianic attempt to \" accelerate \" the return of the apparition .The man who would replace Khomeini , Ali Khamenei , was a revolutionary cleric from Mashhad , in the Khorasan , where the Islamic Republic had boosted the pilgrimage to the shrine of the eighth imam , Reza .The Foundation of the Imam Reza had helped Khamenei in his ascension to power and , after being elected President of the Islamic Republic in 1981 , he was able to expand his power base outside of Khorasan .In Qom , the Ayatollah Muhammad Taqi Bahjat , along with his disciple Mesbah - Yazdi , supported him in his rivalry for power with other religious leaders .When Khomeini died in 1989 , Khamenei was upgraded as an ayatollah and appointed as Iran 's Supreme Leader .Ayatollah Khamenei has followed Khomeini 's repudiation of political mahdism .The next two men to succeed Khameini as president of the Islamic Republic , Ali Akbar Hachemi Rafsanjani ( 1989 - 1997 ) and Muhammad Khatami ( 1997 - 2005 ) , were even more hostile to political mahdism than their predecessors .But the 2005 election of Mahmud Ahmadinejad as President of Iran has undermined the mechanisms proscribing political mahdism within the Islamic Republic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.948746"}

{"text": "Thus Sunni Islamism has had some impact on the generation and development of Shiite Islamism .In this light , it is not surprising that there are various commonalities between modern Sunni and Shiite Islamism .Among the most important is the fact that both Islamist movements were self - consciously devoted to an attack on tradition , and proposed radical new understandings in its place .Nevertheless , despite certain features common to both Sunni and Shiite Islamism - including borrowings from non - Muslim radical movements like Communism and Fascism - Shiite Islamism remains a separate phenomenon ; a distinct form of Islamism .Perhaps the most important factor distinguishing between the Sunni and Shiite Islamism are their respective approaches to tradition .Both Sunni and Shiite Islamism have proposed a radical departure from and transformation of their traditions .Nevertheless , the distinctive character of these traditions necessarily played a role in their transformations , if at some times only because they presented something different to be overcome .This , in turn , affected their respective ideological development and outcomes .In the case of Sunni Islamism , several strands within the tradition were given special emphasis at the expense of others .This special emphasis was in itself an expression of the radical departure from a practice that had generally embraced a variety of traditions - most famously by allowing adherence to any one of four legal schools .It was also relatively accommodating of a variety of theological traditions , especially of the mystical , Sufi variety .Sunni Islamism , by contrast , was and remains especially partial to one legal school - the Hanbali school , which is known for its particular austerity and harshness .Sunni Islamism has also been partial to a somewhat related tradition whose adherents are known as the Ahl al Hadith -the people of the Hadith ( or the accounts , reported on the authority of the Salaf , of the Prophet Muhammad 's sayings and doings . )The adherents of this tradition were characterized by a distrust of all Muslim literature other than the Qur'an and the Hadith , as they had been collected in major compendia .Sunni Islamism expressed its departure and critique of the historical tradition by privileging Hanbali jurisprudence and the Hadith .In so doing , it also revived the thought of certain leading classical authors , in particular the 13th century scholar , writer and polemicist Ibn Taymiyyah .The Sunni Islamist preoccupation with Hadith was a consequence of their invocation of the Salaf ; it also contributed to a general spirit among Sunni Islamists that sought to imitate the ways of the pious ancestors .Insofar as Sunni Islamism seeks to imitate the Salaf , it reaches back to a time before there was a \" tradition , \" and is thus radically untraditional in this sense .For reasons mentioned earlier , and especially because of the distinct distaste among Shiites for the Salaf except for Ali and his partisans , the issue of tradition was for the founders of Shiite Islamism almost necessarily the opposite of the Sunni Islamist view .Several more specific factors - both contemporary and ancient - were also involved in shaping the Shiite view of tradition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.64042"}

{"text": "( Ayatollah Sayyed Hassan Qommi , who was under house arrest for more than two decades after the revolution , is a leading proponent of this kind of criticism of the Islamic Republic . )In today 's Iran , there are still marjas who find fault with the current Islamic government from this perspective .For instance , Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpayegani has fiercely criticized President Ahmadinejad 's decision to appoint several women as ministers of his cabinet .Of course , not all clerical resistance to the Islamic Republic has been based on principle .In fact , many Shiite clerics , both within Iran and without , opposed Khomeini 's revolutionary agenda for entirely personal reasons - just as many clerics today oppose Ayatollah Ali Khamenei because of their own personal grievances and vendettas .Ayatollah Khomeini was especially adept at creating personal enemies within the clerical establishment .Few people in the history of Shiism engaged in publicly attacking and humiliating other clerics as frequently as Khomeini did .In his speeches and statements , Khomeini chastised high - ranking ayatollahs who disagreed with his principle of velayat - e faqih .Because of this antagonistic history between Khomeini and elements of the clerical establishment , some clerics to this day regard Khomeini - and Khamenei as well - as a tyrant who rose to power through illegitimate means and by selectively purging his clerical opponents .Others who early on championed the revolution expected that Khomeini would bring them to power ; when Khomeini failed to do so , these clerics felt slighted and began to hate him .These personal disputes continue to shape the inner workings of the clerical establishment , and of the Islamic regime as a whole .The success of Ayatollah Khomeini in implementing his theory of the rule of the jurist after the 1979 revolution has placed Shiite clerics in a very difficult position .For the first time in the history of Shiism , the revolution had installed an ayatollah in the position of the king ; for many , this made the idea of the implementation of Islamic law seem possible .At the very least , it made the clerical establishment 's conventional reluctance to involve itself in political activity seem antiquated .Moreover , after decades of living under authoritarian and erratically secularist rule during the Pahlavi period , Iran became home to the only government on earth that was run by a Shiite scholar .This historic development was thus popularly invested with even divine significance - and especially within the Shiite community , which had experienced centuries of persecution at the hands of hostile governments .The Islamic revolution thus dramatically transformed the Shiite clerical establishment 's relationship to Iranian political institutions , opening up entirely new horizons for political thought and endeavor .At the same time , the revolution created entirely new dynamics for which the clergy was ill - prepared .For example , before the Islamic revolution , a cleric might have accrued tremendous prestige and authority by popularly opposing an unjust government , and by portraying this conflict as a struggle between spiritual and temporal powers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.89626"}
{"text": "It was with this final restraint that Khomeini 's doctrine appeared to break , and indeed , this still appears to be the case to many quietist Shiites .This paradox within Shiism itself was the product of the tortured early experience of Ali and his partisans , and of the theological and political tensions to which this experience gave rise .This experience brought forth , in relatively equal measures , radicalism on the one hand and quietism on the other .Twelver Shiism , which for long periods would strive to place the emphasis on quietism , could not and did not become a fully articulated doctrine and sect until roughly the 10th and 11th centuries .For it was only at that point that the line of Twelve Imams was established with the disappearance of the final or Hidden Imam .Twelver Shiism was in part a product of the crisis produced by this final Imam 's disappearance - a crisis that represented a kind of culmination of more than 200 hundred years of travail for the partisans of Ali .Thus , Twelver Shiism represented from its inception an uneasy mixture of both radicalism and quietism , and because of this , it was a mixture potentially capable of disruption .In that respect , it was one expression of the dynamic tension of Shiism as it emerged in the first centuries of Islam .To better explain that tension it is necessary to consider briefly that early history , and the origins of Shiism .Shiism 's Origins and Distinctiveness The origins of Shiism 's distinctive views and claims lie in the immediate aftermath of the death in 632 of Prophet Muhammad , the founder of Islam , and the questions his death posed .Who was to succeed him as the new head of the Muslim polity ?How was he to be selected and what would be his status ?From a purely historical and non - religious perspective , the issue of Muhammad 's succession as well as the dispute - indeed , civil war - among early Muslims to which it gave rise may appear to be in essence a political dispute about office .This analysis would , however , be misleading .This is because the character of the Muslim founding stressed the unity of human affairs - including both political and religious affairs - in the light of the unity of God .Due to Muhammad 's role within the community he founded and ruled , and because this community did not distinguish between political and religious office , the dispute that ensued following the prophet 's death could easily , and eventually did , produce theological as well as political differences .Taken as a whole , Shiites believe that the only rightful heir of Muhammad as ruler or caliph of the Muslim polity was the prophet 's cousin and son - in - law Ali ibn Abu Talib .This right is believed to derive partially from a specific designation said to have been conferred upon Ali by Muhammad himself .But since this right was subsequently understood also to belong to Ali 's descendants , it pointed to the notion that there was something qualitatively different about Ali and at least some of his descendants , just as there had been something unique about Muhammad himself as prophet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.060455"}
