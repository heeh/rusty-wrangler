{"text": "We have not seen success in changing the way individuals identify with their same - sex attraction .Parents who attempt to talk their gay - identified children into trying to change their sexuality tend to aggravate and alienate the child .Use of punishment and withdrawal of emotional or financial support to encourage change is hurtful and destructive and could lead to depression , anxiety , and suicidal feelings .Change - oriented therapy under these circumstances is not useful .However , therapy can be helpful in working through family conflict and resolving other issues so long as all parties accept that a shift in sexuality is not the goal .Spiritual challenges .Summary : same - sex attraction , like any challenge , can either bring a person closer to God or challenge their relationship with Him .In our extensive experience , nothing has ever indicated that homosexuality is caused by problems with spirituality .Nor does having same - sex attraction necessarily mean that an individual will have spiritual problems .In fact , for some members , the challenges with same - sex attraction increase their sense of connection with God , and the adherence to His commandments .They rely on God for help and seek the power of the Atonement in their lives .However , others will find their testimony is greatly challenged by their same - sex attraction .The intensity of their needs and desires can overwhelm the desire to live within the gospel plan .Satan can easily use those overwhelming feelings to tempt individuals to experiment and satisfy their intense urges .Some of these people may feel abandoned or betrayed by God , Church leadership , their families , or by other Church members .In addition , many men and women with same - sex attraction become predisposed to resent and mistrust males and those in authority .These issues tend to be deep - seated and result from problems in past relationships .We have found that showing profound love and acceptance toward these individuals can do much to lessen the intensity of these feelings .Nevertheless , therapy may be required to help the individual fully grow beyond these issues .What Causes Same - sex Attraction ?Summary : There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual , bisexual , gay or lesbian orientation .Same - sex attraction appears to be the result of a complex interaction of personality , biological inheritance , and developmental experiences .The American Psychological Association states the following : \" There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual , bisexual , gay or lesbian orientation .Although much research has examined the possible genetic , hormonal , developmental , social and cultural influences on sexual orientation , no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors .Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles ; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation .\" It is difficult to develop theories about the origins of homosexual attractions because no single theory fits every situation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "37.96599"}

{"text": "When the sexual feelings are forced , unwanted , confusing and even painful , the association with the penis can be contaminated .Because the male abuser , particularly when there are negative feelings towards him , involves his penis in the acts , the result can be that some survivors may associate the penis with the hurt , betrayal , pain , humiliation , shame and guilt from the abuse .Think of the confusion you might feel from having these negative emotions about the abuse or abuser , and at the same time trying to feel good about your sexuality , and about a part of your body that is so central to your sexuality as your penis .Many survivors report a desire or temptation to look at the groins of other men , or at their exposed penises in situations like a changing room in school , gym , or at a swimming pool .For survivors , however , the penis may also be a symbol of the harm they have suffered .But notice once again how , when you experience these feelings , you are in fact also re - experiencing the control that the abuser had over you .Now , even though the abuse has ended and you no longer need fear harm from the abuser , these old defense mechanisms are still active .What the abuser did years ago still has the power to influence how you think and behave .One important consideration if you are sexual with other men , but you identify as heterosexual , is to look at why you desire to act sexually with them .One example of this is familiar with those who know or work with abused women .How many women in abusive relationships end their relationship , but then go back to the abusing partner or wind up with another man who turns out to be abusive as well ?This way of thinking leaves them in a situation where they find themselves in a repeating cycle of bad or abusive relationships .It may also be that you have been taught or conditioned that behaving in this way would bring closeness , acceptance or some other emotional need that you may not have had in your life at that time .Or you may have learned that by giving in , you would not be beaten or hurt more .Again , look at all these situations and you can see the continuing control of the abuser .The abuse is over , and perhaps the abuser is gone as well , but the emotional responses you learned as an abused boy are likely still with you .I have recently joined this website and am greatfull for all the support and information .It never entered my mind that I might have been born GAY and that is why even after being sexually abused or not I would have been gay .I lead a very sheltered life till College .Did n't even know there was a word for what I was feeling .I am a bit confused about how GOD feel about all this , but like everything else I 've experienced I will get through it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "38.353046"}

{"text": "The term pedophile was invented by psychiatrists to classify those who have sexual interests in children .It attempts to describe the motivation and inner desires of a child abuser .It is also regularly used by sexual abuse ' experts ' and academicians to ' explain ' how male - on - male CSA is not an example of homosexuality but rather of pedophilia ( child victim ) or perhaps ephebophilia ( teenage victim ) .The problem with these terms is that motivations and desires are hard to pin down and may change over time or in different circumstances .Behavior is not only easier to assess and quantify , but is generally the best reflection of one 's motivations .This is why early in the AIDS epidemic , the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) stopped labeling individuals by sexual orientation and instead classified them by behavior ( e.g. , males - who - have - sex - with - males [ MSM ] ) .By this reckoning , all male - on - male CSA is homosexual molestation , even as all male - on - female CSA is heterosexual molestation .But there is a further important distinction .While psychiatry has defined pedophilia as an exclusive or primary sexual interest in children , in reality very few individuals fit the definition .The vast majority of molesters also have sex with other adults ( often spouses ) or individuals of various ages .This is especially true for perpetrators of homosexual CSA , who often claim to have a homosexual orientation or homosexual desires .Studies of child molesters demonstrate that the perpetrators frequently identify themselves as homosexual or as having homosexual inclinations .In one study where the question was asked directly , 86 % of men who sexually abused boys labeled themselves as bisexual or homosexual .3 Other investigations of groups of convicted child molesters ( including all types of offenders and both boy and girl victims ) reported that the fraction of those who were homosexual or who had \" significant homosexual experiences \" ranged from 22 % to 60 % .The linkage between homosexuality and CSA is also documented in large - scale studies of homosexuals themselves , conducted by gay - sympathetic researchers .The original Kinsey study in 1948 5 found that 28 % of non - delinquent male homosexuals and 20 % of the overall sample of gays admitted to having sex , while adults ( 18 + ) , with boys aged 15 or younger .The Kinsey Research Institute follow - up study in 1970 6 found a similar result : 23 % admitted illegal sex with boys aged 16 or younger when the respondent was at least 21 .Ditto for the 1979 Gay Report survey of over 4,300 male homosexuals , which reported that 22 % admitted to illegal homosexual CSA .In reality , those with homosexual interests tend to be quite sexually flexible , unlike individuals who claim no homosexual desire .8 Other studies have reported that no more than one to five percent of admitted gays claim to have only had sex with other males .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "39.779346"}

'The influence of being around , under the authority of , or living with homosexuals appears to be considerable .With regard to parenting , there is decent evidence that homosexual parents have children who are much more apt to engage in homosexuality .Indeed , enough to suggest that perhaps as many as a third of children with homosexual parents end up engaging in homosexuality .11 Several studies also report a number of harms associated with having had a homosexual parent .A smaller set of evidence has also been gathered on homosexual teachers .In one national study , approximately 12 % of the males and 4 % of the females who claimed to have had a homosexual teacher said that the teacher made sexual advances toward them .About a fifth of those who said that they had a homosexual teacher also said that they were influenced by that teacher to regard homosexuality as socially acceptable .And four percent of both sexes claimed that the teacher influenced them to try homosexuality .It would be a mistake for BSA to ignore the potential influence of older homosexual scouts on younger scouts in their patrols and troops ; or while at scout camps , backpacking , or at other scouting events .Scouting is fundamentally structured to encourage role modeling of the younger by the older .Accepting homosexual scouts will encourage acceptance of homosexuality and may indeed influence some scouts to ' give it a try . 'Is current BSA policy born of ignorance and prejudice ?Although it is commonly asserted that there are no legitimate reasons to discriminate against homosexuality , and that any objections to homosexual acceptance stem from ignorant cultural or religious bias , in truth there is every reason to uphold the current BSA membership standard .Long experience and common sense are consistent with the scientific reality that homosexual scout leaders and scouts pose a clear and present danger to Scouting .A half century ago , the risks of homosexuality could be openly stated in a way that our politically correct culture no longer tolerates .A special assistant attorney general of California said in 1949 \" The sex pervert , in his more innocuous form is too frequently regarded as merely a ' queer ' individual who never hurts anyone but himself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.611702"}

{"text": "So , I have no problem with restorative treatment per se .What I have a problem with is when it 's thrown around as though it were a necessary part of the Church 's position about homosexuality .It 's not .The only treatment the Church calls for is leading a sacramental Catholic life full of prayer and sacrifice .My problem with the what - causes - homosexuality debate is that it obscures the traditional marriage issue ( as well as the issue of whether homosexual acts are moral ) .Some Christians insist upon the \" sexual abuse \" position with a lot zeal , indeed so much zeal that you would think that if it was n't true , then their case for traditional marriage would fall through .But that is n't so !There 's plenty of reasons to favor traditional marriage and none of them is \" homosexuality is caused by sexual abuse \" .All that energy is better spent elsewhere .Some of those who self - identify themselves as \" gay \" find the Church 's distinction between sinner and sin offensive .Chai Feldblum It seemed to me the height of disingenuousness , absurdity , and indeed disrespect to tell someone it is okay to ' be ' gay , but not necessarily okay to engage in gay sex .What do they think being gay means ?This is the sort of thinking we should be directing our energy towards .The propensity towards homosexuality does not mean you must engage in homosexual acts .Denying your desires does not make you a lesser person - whether you were born with them or acquired them later , your desires do not define you .Insisting on \" homosexuality is caused by sexual abuse \" only deals with the identity issue in a round - about and , for many of those who favor same - sex marriage , unpersuasive way .@Patrick Some clarifying words of wisdom : Sin and Temptation are two different things .James Every , a Catholic writer and speaker for teenage chastity , lists four reasons for the temptation of same sex attraction .However I speak personally about the fourth .The fourth is that while children develop as teenagers they learn about their sexuality .Boys learn what is to be men , and girls women .They do not know what it is to be a man or women ( as opposed to children ) so they have to learn it .As humans the one of the most useful means is by observation .Since they are teenagers at hormonal peaks of their lives , they can become infatuated at the drop of a hat .So the reality is that the teenager finds an exemplar model for their own sex .The GLBT turns that into \" you are a homosexual \" or \" you where born into the wrong sex .\" @General I wish I could remember the name of the guest on Charlie Rose that wonderfully explained the structures of morality and government between the two parties .On homosexual marriage he did state that there was a just , unbiased , and successfully way to resolve the situation : abolish government marriage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.670067"}

{"text": "Tomeo 's prime research hypothesis was that homosexuals would report more sexual abuse than heterosexuals .She also wanted to know when a person identified as gay and when the abuse occurred .This is an important question for studies which seek to attribute cause to abuse .With some people being aware of same - sex attraction at very early ages , one can not say any subsequent abuse caused their SSA .Simply finding a significant difference between gay and straight groups can not tell you anything definitive about cause .Here are the first nine questions Tomeo asked her participants : .Do you regard yourself as predominantly a heterosexual person or predominantly a gay / lesbian person ?If predominantly of heterosexual orientation , at what age did you begin to regard yourself as heterosexual ?If predominantly of homosexual orientation , at what age did you begin to regard yourself as homosexual ?Before you were 16 years old , did you ever have sexual contact with a woman or girl 5 or more years older than yourself and at least 16 years of age ?( YES NO ) .IF YES , at what age did this first occur ?What was your relationship to the person with whom this sexual contact occurred ?Before you were 16 years old , did you ever have sexual contact with a man or boy 5 or more years older than yourself and at least 16 years of age ?( YES NO ) .IF YES , at what age did this first occur ?What was your relationship to the person with whom this sexual contact occurred ?For a study of causation , these questions clearly have their limitations .For one thing , when one regards oneself as homosexual probably occurs later ( sometimes much later ) than awareness of same - sex attraction .Perhaps one could offer a theory of identity formation which includes sexual abuse but such a theory would not of necessity be a theory of how one 's attractions take the direction they do .In Tomeo 's reporting of her study in both the dissertation and the journal article , however , there is a much larger concern .There are contradictions in the paper and the dissertation between the results sections and the discussion sections .A crucial problem is the inability to be certain about when the abuse occurred - before or after awareness of same - sex attraction .In the Archives of Sexual Behavior article , the following statement is made on pages 540 - 541 ( this same statement is identical to her closing discussion in the dissertation ) : .Sixty - eight percent of the present homosexual male participants and 38 % of the present homosexual female participants ( 68 and 36 % , respectively , if including just the homosexual fair participants ) did not identify as homosexual until after the molestation .This suggests that if molestation resulted in homosexuality , this phenomenon occurs in a greater proportion of male homosexuals .It may not , however , be a casual factor in either gender .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.373154"}

{"text": "Those who self - identify as bisexual need not be equally attracted to both sexes .To be gender dysphoric means experiencing a longstanding level of discontent with one 's birth sex and/or the gender roles associated with that sex .There are varying degrees of gender dysphoria , discussed in greater detail below .For the most part , sexual orientation and gender identity are unrelated .Nor does being heterosexual , homosexual , or bisexual necessarily correlate to having ( or not having ) a gender identity issue .More on Sexual Orientation .Human sexual orientation ( who / what we are attracted to ) is believed to exist on a continuum .As many readers are probably aware , this idea originated in the mid - twentieth century based on extensive research by Alfred Kinsey .His research and theories have since been expanded and expounded upon by numerous other sexologists , most notably Fritz Klein .Today , Kinsey 's continuum theory is almost universally accepted .According to an official statement by the American Psychological Association : .Sexual orientation is an enduring emotional , romantic , sexual , or affectionate attraction toward others .It is easily distinguished from other components of sexuality including biological sex , gender identity ( the psychological sense of being male or female ) , and the social gender role ( adherence to cultural norms for feminine and masculine behavior ) .Sexual orientation lies along a continuum that ranges from exclusive heterosexuality to exclusive homosexuality and includes various forms of bisexuality .Bisexual persons can experience sexual , emotional , and affectional attraction to both their own sex and the opposite sex .Sexual orientation is different from sexual behavior because it refers to feelings and self - concept ( rather than sexual activity ) .Individuals may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviors .Of course , a lot of folks out there find the terms heterosexual , homosexual , and bisexual somewhat limiting , and sometimes even degrading .This , of course , does n't stop the universal attempt to label .In fact , a wide variety of terminology is used by a wide array of people - and sometimes these terms have definitions that are flexible to the point of confusion , which may be the point .Terms I hear fairly often include pansexual , polysexual , heteroflexible , homoflexible , queer , sexually open - minded , MSM ( men who have sex with men ) , and WSW ( women who have sex with women ) .And there are many more terms than this in common usage , each expressing various points on the Kinsey continuum .Proposed explanations for various sexual orientations include both nature and nurture .As a gay man who strongly believes he was \" born this way , \" I lean toward genetics and the in - utero experience as primary influences .My colleague Joe Kort has written and spoken extensively about these factors , so rather than elaborating on them here I will simply direct you to his work if you 're interested in learning more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.452724"}

{"text": "[ 31 ] .The relationship between biology and sexual orientation is a subject of research .Any simple and singular determinant for sexual orientation has not been conclusively demonstrated ; various studies point to different , even conflicting positions , but scientists hypothesize that a combination of genetic , hormonal , and social factors determine sexual orientation .[ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Biological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation are more popular , [ 34 ] and biological factors may involve a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment .[36 ] These factors , which may be related to the development of heterosexual as well as other orientation , include genes , prenatal hormones , and brain structure .The neurobiology of the masculinization of the brain is fairly well understood .Estradiol and testosterone , which is catalyzed by the enzyme 5\u03b1 - reductase into dihydrotestosterone , act upon androgen receptors in the brain to masculinize it .If there are few androgen receptors ( people with androgen insensitivity syndrome ) or too much androgen ( females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia ) , there can be physical and psychological effects .[38 ] It has been suggested that both male and female heterosexuality are results of variation in this process .[ 39 ] In these studies heterosexuality in females is linked to a lower amount of masculinization than is found in lesbian females , though when dealing with male heterosexuality there are results supporting both higher and lower degrees of masculinization than homosexual males .[41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] .The study of the environment and sexual orientation is research into possible environmental influences on the development of human sexual orientation .Some researchers distinguish environmental influences from hormonal influences , [ 44 ] while others include biological influences such as prenatal hormones as part of environmental influences .[45 ] .At the beginning of the 20th century , early theoretical discussions in the field of psychoanalysis posited original bisexuality in human psychological development .Quantitative studies by Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s and Dr. Fritz Klein 's sexual orientation grid in the 1980s find distributions similar to those postulated by their predecessors .According to Sexual Behavior in the Human Male by Alfred Kinsey and several other modern studies , the majority of humans have had both heterosexual and homosexual experiences or sensations and are bisexual .Kinsey himself , along with current sex therapists , focused on the historicity and fluidity of sexual orientation .Kinsey 's studies consistently found sexual orientation to be something that evolves in many directions over a person 's lifetime ; rarely , but not necessarily , including forming attractions to a new sex .Rarely do individuals radically reorient their sexualities rapidly - and still less do they do so volitionally - but often sexualities expand , shift , and absorb new elements over decades .For example , socially normative \" age - appropriate \" sexuality requires a shifting object of attraction ( especially in the passage through adolescence ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.303078"}

{"text": "This pejorative usage has its origins in the late 1970s .Beginning in the 1980s and especially in the late 1990s , the usage as a generic insult became common among young people .By the mid-20th century , gay was well established in reference to hedonistic and uninhibited lifestyles and its antonym straight , which had long had connotations of seriousness , respectability , and conventionality , had now acquired specific connotations of heterosexuality .In the case of gay , other connotations of frivolousness and showiness in dress ( \" gay apparel \" ) led to association with camp and effeminacy .This association no doubt helped the gradual narrowing in scope of the term towards its current dominant meaning , which was at first confined to subcultures .Gay was the preferred term since other terms , such as queer , were felt to be derogatory .Homosexual is perceived as excessively clinical , since the sexual orientation now commonly referred to as \" homosexuality \" was at that time a mental illness diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) .In mid-20th century Britain , where male homosexuality was illegal until the Sexual Offences Act 1967 , to openly identify someone as homosexual was considered very offensive and an accusation of serious criminal activity .Additionally , none of the words describing any aspect of homosexuality were considered suitable for polite society .Consequently , a number of euphemisms were used to hint at suspected homosexuality .Examples include \" sporty \" girls and \" artistic \" boys , all with the stress deliberately on the otherwise completely innocent adjective .The sixties marked the transition in the predominant meaning of the word gay from that of \" carefree \" to the current \" homosexual \" .By 1963 , a new sense of the word gay was known well enough to be used by Albert Ellis in his book The Intelligent Woman 's Guide to Man - Hunting .Tags : .Oh it was !I just hate making typos , especially when they 're titles like that .But that 's exactly my point .You have one person who identifies as sexual , but who requires certain situations and scenarios to become aroused , and you have another person , who identifies as asexual , who can become aroused in certain situations and scenarios .It 's not one person with a kink and another person with specific needs -- it 's two people with specific needs .Is the difference between them really just the choice of self - identification , or is there a deeper difference , do you think ?Okay , let me preface this by saying that I 'm not in the kink community at all , so while I have a working understanding of some issues I 'm not 100 % on these things .If I say anything wrong / offensive I apologize in advance and please let me know and correct me .If you look at it like that , I think the difference lies in the specific issue that their willingness / not is actually hinging on ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.708107"}

Henry .[11 ] Henry 's book concerned conversations with homosexual males and used this term in connection with the reference to ex - gays .It currently simply is a colloquial term for \" heterosexual \" having , like many words , changed in primary meaning over time .Some object to usage of the term \" straight \" because it implies that non - heteros are crooked .[ 12 ] .Heterosexual symbolism dates back to the earliest artifacts of humanity , with ritual fertility carvings and primitive art .This was later expressed in the symbolism of fertility rites and polytheistic worship , which often included images of human reproductive organs , such as lingam in Hinduism .Modern symbols of heterosexuality in societies derived from European traditions still reference symbols used in these ancient beliefs .One such image is a combination of the symbol for Mars , the Roman god of war , as the definitive male symbol of masculinity , and Venus , the Roman goddess of love and beauty , as the definitive female symbol of femininity .The Judeo - Christian tradition has several scriptures related to heterosexuality .In Genesis 2:24 , there is a commandment stating \" Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh \" ( Gen 2:24 )", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.60889"}
