''I 've never received a viewer complaint that we put a Giants or Dallas game into L.A.

{"text": "Moss had grown up a Cowboys fan , wanted to be their guy , and Dallas spurned him in the draft by drafting Greg Ellis instead .Jerry has no problems with his memory especially since Randy Moss will go to the Hall of Fame one day and in his rookie year , he caught 69 balls for 1313 yards and 17 touchdowns .Moss got his revenge on Thanksgiving when he and his team , the Vikings , showed up to Dallas , and Moss had three catches .All three were for touchdowns and over 50 yards each .He finished the day with 163 receiving yards in a 46 - 36 win for the Vikings .That was devastating because the Cowboys went 10 - 6 that year and lost in the playoffs to the Cardinals .Think about how different things would have been if Moss had been paired with Michael Irvin ?Jerry Jones is not about to make the same mistake twice .He 's going to take this young man whose character questions are arguably exaggerated , and Jerry is going to give him a chance to play football for the star .This move also lights a fire under Roy Williams if he wants to stay a Cowboy .While I agree with many experts that the trade for Roy Williams was a reach , it can still pay dividends if he plays like the wide receiver that Jerry believes he 's capable of playing as .This also spells the possibility of losing Patrick Crayton or Sam Hurd , two veteran receivers that I had come to cherish during their time here in the Big D. .Hopefully Dallas can keep them all because I 'd love to see them win a Super Bowl with Dallas .Interesting Stat About Dallas and First Round Receivers .The one thing about this move that concerns me is the late draft history Dallas has when it comes to receivers .In 2000 , Dallas traded two first round draft picks to the Seahawks for Joey Galloway whose career stats for Dallas are 151 catches for 2341 yards and 12 touchdowns .Seattle used those picks on the 2005 MVP Shaun Alexander and wide receiver Koren Robinson .Then we traded Galloway to Tampa Bay for Keyshawn Johnson , and all I can say is UGH !Finally , we trade our first , third , and sixth round picks to Detroit for Roy Williams and a seventh round pick .Those picks drafted Brandon Pettigrew and Derrick Williams , and neither team so far has benefited from those trades .Dallas has n't been very good at trading for real receiver talent , and when you trade draft picks for them , it 's the same as if you drafted them yourself .Also , Jerry Jones did not draft Michael Irvin .Michael Irvin was the last first round pick of the Landry Era .So , Jerry Jones has done zilch when it comes to drafting first round receivers .And before you mention how the Ravens were about to draft Dez Bryant , and they are excellent drafters , I 'll remind you that the one position that the Ravens have n't drafted well is wide receiver .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.56238"}
