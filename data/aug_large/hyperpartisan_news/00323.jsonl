{"text": "The great America school believes that no idea , however noble in theory , means much unless sufficient political power is accumulated to realize it in practice , even if the process of making it happen results in compromises that leave the idea less than complete .Yes , power corrupts , adherents to this way of thinking agree , but impotence cripples .Corruption is the enemy of goodness , while complacency is the enemy of greatness .Maturity , not perfection , is the achievement advocates for greatness seek .The United States must overcome its sense of itself as special in order to join the real world of nation states responding to pressures within and challenges without .While always threatened from other nation - states that aspire to greatness in their own way , the biggest stumbling block to greatness lies at home in the American passion for goodness .Not everyone fits within either of these two categories , some because they belong to neither and others because they belong to both .Given the corruption associated with his presidency as well as his manifest lack of political skills , Ulysses S. Grant might be viewed as standing neither for goodness nor for greatness .Progressives such as Louis D. Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter , reformers never quite comfortable with the bigness in government and industry that reform usually implied , understood their task as arguing on behalf of goodness and greatness simultaneously .Perhaps the most interesting Americans never to fit easily into either the goodness or the greatness camps were Woodrow Wilson and Reinhold Niebuhr .Categories such as goodness and greatness can hopefully shed a new and different kind of light on American politics and culture , even if such categories , like all categories , do not illuminate everything .Of these two visions for America , it is the school of goodness , and not the school of greatness , that has traditionally held the upper hand .Americans choose goodness over greatness for the same reasons that they prefer to be innocents abroad , to opt for religions that emphasize the purity of the heart , and to insist and to talk so much about virtue and morality .The closer we stick to what we know best , the more likely we will be to resist the temptations put in our path .One of the most important questions we face as a nation is whether this preference for the good over the great is our best guide to the world revealed to us by the events of September 11 .If it is true that the events of that day put the question of greatness on the American table again , whether or not Americans want it put there , the discussion that follows is likely to be greeted with a mixed reception .For some the idea of greatness for America will provoke a feeling of dread , as if this thankfully discredited form of patronizing hubris ought never to be resurrected .For others it will engender a feeling of lost pride , as if the United States needs once again to develop a sense of purpose and the confidence to see it through .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.44329"}

Bush was able to come in a close enough second to take the presidency due to irregularities in Florida and a friendly Supreme Court .This victory in 2000 , along with the 9/11 attack , gave Bush , as an incumbent during time of war , an edge which future Republican candidates are unlikely to enjoy .The current political divisions wo n't last in their current form forever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.389862"}

Buckley , Jr. and his colleagues in the 1950s and 1960s , [ i ] Conservatism 1.0 struggled , persisted , gained support slowly , and then rose to victory with the election and presidency of Ronald Reagan .The Party of Reagan was based firmly on the view that \" liberalism is bad . \" In this environment , Reagan 's GOP found itself directly opposed to the Democratic Party of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his progressive successors .The ensuing debate pitted conservatism against liberalism in a few direct , simple ways : limited government versus big government , Constitutional originalism versus judicial activism , American exceptionalism versus European style internationalism , and individualism versus collectivism .Republicans saw conservatism as good precisely because it espoused limited government , strict adherence to the Constitution , American leadership in the world , and individual freedoms .They saw liberalism as bad because it promoted big government , an activist Court , American subordination to international organizations , and widespread collectivism through higher taxes and increased government programs in all facets of life .This was the battle of Postwar America .And conservatives saw themselves as the Keepers of Freedom and Family Values in this monumental conflict - warriors for the American Dream and the American way of life .After the financial downgrade of the Soviet Union during the Reagan years and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 , the battle lines were slowly redrawn .New superpowers emerged on the world stage , and existing alliances began to unravel .Naturally , during the 1990s the old battles were replaced with new ones , and in the 2000s world and national allegiances were weakened , redirected , and reconceived .But the hearts of many 20 th Century conservatives ( and liberals , for that matter ) , raised and steeped in the old battles , did n't change .Conservatism 2.0 .A new cultural movement sprouted in the different soil after 1989 .In technology , this shift was exemplified by Steve Jobs , and eventually Elon Musk .In business , the iconic figureheads were Bill Gates and Warren Buffett .And on the political front , the pioneers of a new model were Ross Perot and Ralph Nader , and later Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul .Congressman Paul 's contribution to the new brand of conservatism that arose is hard to overstate .For example : .It replaced Reagan 's 11 th Commandment ( \" Thou shalt not criticize other Republicans \" ) with a focus on principles of freedom rather than institutional political parties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.542282"}

{"text": "Polls can still change in either direction between now and February , and a victory in New Hampshire certainly is no guarantee of winning the nomination .What makes this election different from previous elections is the scandal surrounding the Clinton campaign , and the email scandal become much worse for her .Top secret emails were found on Clinton 's private server , contradicting her previous denials , and Clinton has agreed to surrender the server , now realizing that it would be subpoenaed if she refused this request from the Justice Department .From an ethical standpoint , this is not the worst aspect of the email scandal .Ethically she did worse in violating principles of transparency , in destroying evidence , and in receiving financial rewards from parties she provided favorable decisions to as Secretary of State .I do not believe Clinton intended to violate laws regarding classified information , but his appears to have been a consequence of her foolish decision to use a private server , and this is what places her at serious risk of criminal prosecution .Prior to this latest development , The New York Times reviewed the controversy to date and pointed out the legal ramifications .This was before the report that top secret information was present : .Officials say the bureau at this point has no target in mind and no evidence that a crime was committed .But the investigation takes place in an administration that has taken an especially hard line on the handling of classified information .Scott Gration , ambassador to Kenya , resigned after a 2012 inspector general 's report accused him of flouting government rules , including the requirement that he use State Department email . \"He has willfully disregarded Department regulations on the use of commercial email for official government business , \" the report said .A New York firefighter and decorated combat veteran who served in the Marines in Afghanistan , Jason Brezler , is currently fighting dismissal from the Marine Corps for sending , via his personal account , an email attachment the government says was classified .His lawyer , Kevin Carroll , says he sent the message in response to an emergency request from a base in Afghanistan .Mrs. Clinton and her aides have noted that the material the inspectors general call classified was not labeled as such in the emails .But in 2010 , Thomas Drake , a former senior National Security Agency official , was indicted under the Espionage Act for keeping an agency email printout at home that was not marked as classified .( Mr. Drake pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor . )J. William Leonard , a former director of the government 's Information Security Oversight Office , said that in Mrs. Clinton 's case , criminal charges like those against Mr. Drake are highly unlikely .But as a former security official , he said , he was dismayed by her exclusive use of private email .The State Department has an obligation to monitor unclassified email for exactly this kind of classified spillage , he said , as well as to protect computer systems and provide emails to Congress or the public when required by law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.2776"}

'He said to me that the cartoons insulted all Muslims ' , Khader remembers . 'I said I was not insulted .And he said , \" But you 're not a real Muslim \" . 'That sums up the liberal attitude towards Muslims .You are only a ' proper ' Muslim if you want to ban Danish cartoons , or are offended by The Satanic Verses or think that Monica Ali 's Brick Lane is demeaning to your community .Similarly , you are only a proper Sikh if you are offended by Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti 's play Behzti .Someone like Naser Khader , on the other hand , or like Salman Rushdie or Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti , or Monica Ali , are seen as too liberal , too ' Westernized ' , too progressive , to be truly of their community .The consequence has been that the most reactionary figures get to be seen as the authentic voices of those communities .And in presenting Muslim communities in this fashion , liberals do the racists ' job for them .The protests against the cartoons , as Khader put it , ' were not about Mohammed .They were about who should represent Muslims ' .And what was ' really offensive ' to him was that ' journalists and politicians see the fundamentalists as the real Muslims ' .It 's one of the ironies of the liberal multicultural view .Liberals argue for multicultural policies on the grounds that we live in a diverse nation .But they seem also to believe that such diversity somehow magically stops at the edges of minority communities .They wash over differences and conflicts in those communities , seeing them instead as fixed , homogenous groups with a single set of views , primarily driven by faith .And they rely on so - called community leaders to be suitable judges of what is and is not acceptable or necessary for that community .As a result , progressive voices often get silenced as ' inauthentic ' or as not really being of that community .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.56545"}

Bush and citing bogus attacks from the Wall Street Journal .This is not how to get Democratic - leaning voters to turn out to vote .A candidate such as Sanders , who excites crowds and is motivating more people to register to vote Democratic , is a far safer bet in the general election .There is strong evidence that Sanders is electable in a general election .While it might turn out that the Republicans nominate a candidate anyone could beat , there are big question marks when looking at a Clinton candidacy .Plus the same views and history which make Clinton a weak candidate also make her a far less desirable president than Sanders , even if it turns out that either could win .The conventional wisdom was that Hillary Clinton had an extraordinary month in October , with some pundits going as far to claim she virtually wrapped up the nomination .Yet now we are in November and Bernie Sanders has hardly been knocked out of the race .He is even looking like he is on track to win the month of November .While polls this long before primaries have limited predictive value , they tend to show Sanders gaining slightly on Clinton with no signs of Clinton opening a wider lead over Sanders .Instead of the Biden supporters all falling in line behind Clinton as the pundits predicted , Biden 's support is dividing fairly equally between the two .Take the latest New York Times / CBS News survey .The spin favors Clinton , but look at the actual numbers .Seeing Sanders close the gap , even if slightly , is a plus for him after all favorable publicity for Clinton in October .The key line , however , is , \" Half of Democratic primary voters said it was still too early to say for sure who they would support . \"As I have discussed previously , polls before the primaries have little predictive value , largely because so many people do not make up their mind until the last minute .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.17169"}

{"text": "That 's my view as well .One problem with many people is that they have a collectivist way of thinking .And this even applies to conservatives and libertarians , people who generally support private property rights , or think they do .Unfortunately , there are many people who , even though they support the property owner 's right to own and control one 's own private property , they still see the local zoning board as legitimate .They still see property taxes as legitimate .This is because these people - whether they will admit or not - see one 's own private property as ultimately owned by the community as a whole .And so the community has the ultimate say as to what the rules of the private property should be .No smoking .No 9-car garages .If you have attack dogs you must post warning signs .But this is also with conservatives .I have been amazed when seeing local municipal government websites especially in conservative areas , with zoning boards and all the rest .However , Grafton , New Hampshire does not have zoning , as well as other similar towns up there .But they are quite alone .I have mentioned this before , but the conservatives totally abandon any belief they think they have in private property rights when it comes to the immigration issue .Many of them are really nationalists , which is a combination of collectivism and authoritarianism .If conservatives really advocated private property rights ( and free markets as well ) , they would favor anyone anywhere in the world having the freedom to exercise his right to sell his labor to anyone anywhere else in the world .The laborer is the initial owner ( as a private property right ) of his own labor until he sells it to the employer or customer for their agreed price or wage .The businessman 's private property right to run his own business and hire the ones he decides are the best qualified workers are his decision , ultimately .However , the anti - private property rights conservatives want to use the armed power of the State to overrule the individual businessman 's decisions and the individual worker 's right to sell one 's labor freely .Such conservative intruders will go on and on and on , with this or that argument , based on nationalism and in many ways ethnicism and racism , although they do n't seem to want to admit that .I see their behavior as coming from narcissism ( which is what this \" American Exceptionalism \" is largely based on , in my view ) , and covetousness .Deep down , a lot of people are very resentful of others having an actual work ethic and skills to sell wiling buyers , and these anti - private property folks are resentful of business owners who have skills at running a business and serving the consumers .And by the resentful ones here I am not talking about liberals and progressives !Their grandiose , ultra - reactionary ( and even communist ! ) solution to their worries about labor and employment freedom is to build a government wall .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.06847"}

Bush administration but were slowed down as the Obama White House renegotiated changes and haggled with Republicans over the worker aid program .Democratic opposition was strongest against the Colombia deal because of that country 's record of violence against labor leaders .Going beyond cutting tariffs , the alliance would tackle such areas as financial services , intellectual property rights , government procurement , investment and conservation .Kirk said negotiators had been \" making really good progress \" and they hoped to have the broad outline of an agreement when leaders meet in Honolulu next month for the annual Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation forum .\" TPP is the one game in town and there is going to be a lot of focus on that , \" said John Murphy , vice president for international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .But in a world filled with acronyms , TPP would have a tough time getting congressional approval without TPA .Trade promotion authority , also known as fast track , gives the president the authority to negotiate trade deals that Congress can either accept or reject , but can not amend .That authority expired in 2007 and Obama , tied to Democrats and labor groups who oppose further free trade agreements , has not pushed for its restoration .Last month Senate Republicans tried to revive TPA , but the measure was defeated on a largely party - line vote .Democrats argued that the TPA law has to first be rewritten to reflect changes in such areas as digital services and the environment .Kirk also emphasized the importance of getting other countries to abide by existing trade rules .Mitt Romney , currently viewed as the strongest contender for the GOP presidential nomination , said in a trade policy speech this month that he would work to reestablish TPA and promote more free trade agreements .He also singled out China , saying that as president he would take punitive actions if China continues to unfairly subsidize its domestic products and manipulate its currency .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.151535"}

{"text": "That solution to what would otherwise be a \" free rider \" problem is crucial to the ability of unions to effectively represent the interests of workers .Even though a unanimous Supreme Court recognized the principle of Abood as recently as 2009 , subsequent 5 - 4 decisions written by Justice Alito have criticized that ruling and effectively invited attempts to overturn it .That is exactly what the plaintiffs in Friedrichs , a small group of California teachers , are attempting to do , claiming they should not have to join or pay \" fair share \" costs to the state teachers union and that Abood should be overturned .The justices ' comments at the oral argument made clear that the conservative 5 - 4 majority remains hostile to unions and Abood , and may well be prepared to overrule it this year .( As usual , Justice Thomas did not speak at the argument , but his negative views in this area have been made clear in past opinions ) .Regardless of the merits of that claim , on which many have disagreed , it strongly suggests that there may now be five votes to overturn Abood , with disastrous consequences for unions and workers .It is impossible , of course , to predict the precise outcome of a Supreme Court case based on the oral argument , and the Court could issue a decision that does not completely overrule Abood .Particularly if the Court chooses one of those alternatives , the question of who will replace older justices like Kennedy , Ginsburg , and Scalia when they retire will be critical .That is why the election in November of our next president , who will nominate such replacements , is crucial for the Court and workers ' rights .Even an outright overruling of Abood could be softened or revisited , but only if a progressive president is elected and selects more progressives Justices for the Court .During January , the Court also agreed to review several important cases on other subjects this year .Twenty - six states led by Texas filed the challenge , and the huge partisan divide on the question almost guarantees that it will be an election issue this fall .The decision itself could have a huge impact not only on this specific issue , but also on the ability of a future progressive president to take other executive action in the face of a recalcitrant Congress .However this case is decided , there is also little question that these issues will return to the Court in 2017 or later , and the views of the president who will appoint future justices will be crucial to the results .The Court also decided in January to review several other important cases this year .In one , the Court has been asked to decide whether a state constitution can more strictly separate church and state than the increasingly conservative Supreme Court has and can prohibit any direct state financial aid to religious institutions .Thirty - five states have such constitutional provisions , and the Court is very divided on such religion issues , which are very likely to come up in the future as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.02878"}

Tuchfarber has looked at the December polls and has also demonstrated how little predictive value they have .In polls from November 2007 , taken two months before voting , Hillary Clinton was leading the Democratic race .Rudy Guiliani was leading the Republican race , with Fred Thompson also ahead of John McCain .In 2011 Herman Cain was leading the Republican race , and had left the race by the time of the Iowa caucuses .One reason for the poor predictive value of national polls is that whoever wins in Iowa and/or New Hampshire generally gets a huge boost in subsequent states .That does n't mean that the polls in Iowa are all that more meaningful as voters there typically do n't make up their minds until the last minute .Hillary Clinton was leading in the polls in Iowa and came in third place in 2008 .In late 2007 Mitt Romney was leading the polls in Iowa , and came in second to Mike Huckabee .Herman Cain was leading in Iowa as well as the national polls two months before the Iowa caucus .Polls also have limited predictive value as the pollsters do not know who will actually turn out to vote .If the Democratic caucus in Iowa is dominated by long time Democratic voters , then the polls are showing the race as very close .If those who have n't previously voted but are showing enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders turn out to vote , there could be a big victory for Sanders .The much stronger degree of support seen for Sanders in social media is very encouraging , but no guarantee of votes .It might also be helpful for Sanders that the Iowa caucuses are later this year than in the 2008 cycle , when many college students were off on vacation .Even more might turn out for Sanders in this year than had turned out for Obama .Similarly we will not know whether Donald Trump will easily win the nomination , or if a party regular will challenge him , until we see how the voters act .Here 's a result to unnerve her Brooklyn campaign headquarters .Both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton get a 60 percent favorable rating with 18-to-29-year - olds .She gets 35 percent approval and 57 percent unfavorable .In the last presidential election , 19 percent of the voters were in that age cohort , which Obama won , 60 percent to 37 percent , providing his overall margin .There was a substantial decline in the number of young voters in the off - year elections , probably costing Democrats a couple Senate seats ; a similar drop - off in 2016 might be decisive in a close election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.7168"}
