Johnson in 1960 , has a VP choice ever had a positive ( as opposed to a non - negative ) impact on a party 's chances ?This one could , both for giving a little zip to the campaign and , as an attraction to Clinton 's die - hard supporters like my disenchanted friend , setting her up for the top of the ticket in 2016 .At the moment , this is just standard off - year political gabble , but it does make some sense .The Clinton - Biden switch is unlikely because it is so risky .No incumbent president has brought a new face to a presidential ticket since Bob Dole joined Gerald Ford in 1976 -- and they lost .Similarly , the last job swap of this magnitude was when Treasury Secretary Don Regan traded jobs with White House chief of staff Jim Baker , which most historians agree was a bad move .Social science research has long taught us that vice presidential candidates matter little to voters when they cast their ballot for president .Political scientists David Rohde , Nelson Polsby , David Romero and others have shown that vice presidential candidates exert no statistically significant positive impact in presidential elections .( With one major exception in modern American history : in 1960 , vice presidential candidate Lyndon B. Johnson helped his running mate John F. Kennedy win the election by carrying Texas , Johnson 's home state . )But were President Obama to ask Secretary Hillary Clinton to join him on the 2012 presidential ticket , it would indicate two things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.27102"}

W. Bush , and Obama and Hillary Clinton .All of a sudden , Donald Trump has signed a pledge not to run independently , and to back whoever wins the Republican Presidential nomination .Anyone who believes he will keep his word is naive and delusional , as it is only a pledge for now since Trump is leading in all public opinion polls and could mount an independent campaign with his own money , a la Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996 .Perot well knew he could not win as an Independent , but ran anyway , and helped Bill Clinton in both elections .This time , ironically , a Trump independent candidacy would insure that Hillary Clinton , or possibly Joe Biden or even Bernie Sanders , would win .If one holds his or her breath hoping that Trump will be loyal to his pledge , think again and start breathing !The nativism and racism of Donald Trump is the greatest we have seen in American politics on the national level since Pat Buchanan ran for President in 1992 , 1996 , and 2000 .Trump has gone out of his way to insult Mexican Americans in particular , and Hispanics - Latinos in general , and has gained 20 - 30 percent support in the various polls .Now he has gone further and insulted Asian Americans , mimicking the way they speak English .He has gained a lot of support from Southern states in polls for these controversial statements and nativist attacks .In so doing , he has insured that the Republican Party can not win much of a percentage of either Hispanics - Latinos or the Asian American vote , and without it , they can not win the Presidency .But also , neo Nazi , white supremacist , and Confederate groups are rushing to support Trump , and his reaction has been quite tepid , to say the least .With these elements , there is also , and worrisome , a large element of anti Semitism , a reality in the past for Buchanan and Duke that is well known , and has been again stated by Duke explicitly in his recent unasked for endorsement of Trump .With three Republican Presidential candidates for 2016 being \" non politicians \" , people who have never served in a government position on the city , state or national level , the issue arises : have there been any other such candidates in the past ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.683876"}

Biden would make a great Secretary of State , and not mind the change in positions if it appears this switch would help the Democratic Party stay in power for another 4 yrs ., maybe even 12 yrs .Hillary Clinton has done an outstanding job as Secretary of State !Biden is great as Vice President .( Better than Cheney )The job of Secretary of State is far more important to Obama than Vice President .Change comes slowly - but it is coming ! !It took years for us to get into this mess - and with some cooperation from the members of Congress ( both parties ) we are climbing out of this hole !Obama will be re - elected - and he has a great team !Who would take Hillary 's place ?Would her position as VP help or hurt the work she has been doing as Secretary of State ?There is alot more to the issue ... but it could be ' just the ticke't for what s ailing the democrates .I think Hillary Clinton would make a great Vice President .She has the credentials and the experience , unfortunately Obama dropping Biden for his 2012 reelection campaign is absolutely ridiculous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.684105"}

Chris Christie , fresh off his Garden State re - election landslide victory and widespread national media attention , jumped to the top of the pack of potential contenders for the GOP nomination .Twenty - four percent of Republicans and independents who lean towards the GOP questioned in the survey say they 'd be likely to support Christie for the Republican nomination , up seven percentage points from a CNN poll in early September .Back then , Christie and Rep.

Rand Paul of Kentucky , at 13 % .Sorry , but a win in New Jersey is hardly a microcosm of winning a primary in the Republican party or a national election .New Jersey is it 's own animal , much like every state is .Much of the GOP base considered Chris Christie a \" Benedict Arnold \" when he went overboard gushing over Barack Obama after Hurricane Sandy , sabotaging any chance Mitt Romney may have had .The GOP have run two ' RINO 's ' in a row , the \" maverick y \" John McCain in 2008 and Mitt \" Romneycare \" Romney in 2012 .Both candidates alienated the GOP base and in the end , really stood for nothing , except they ere not Obama .At what point will the establishment Republicans understand that the GOP electorate wants a candidate with substance and is not Democrat - light ?The focus this last week should have been on Obama 's shameful conduct in Benghazi .Instead , the schizophrenic Christie allowed himself to be manipulated by Obama 's camp so easily , that one has to question the reasoning for his desertion of Governor Romney .I believe the egomaniacal Christie would rather run for POTUS in 2016 than 2020 .And chose to spend the last week stabbing Mitt in the back .I understand that Christie had to \" break bread \" with Obama when Obama came to tour New Jersey for disaster relief for Hurricane Sandy .We all should be fine with that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.18768"}

Hayes .What we have here are two 19th - century presidents whose similar experiences and fates bode ill for Bush in 2004 .Although U.S. presidents have never been elected by direct popular vote , no one who took office after losing the popular vote has gotten in honestly , and every one of them has been forced out after a single term .You can be sure the Bush camp knows this and is planning accordingly .Here is a short history of popular - vote - losing , election - stealing U.S. presidents -- and their fates .The Adams Family .Before 1824 , U.S. presidential elections were blatantly undemocratic , just as the founders had intended .The American Revolution had been instigated and led primarily by upper - class types , and many of these people believed God wanted power to remain in the hands of those already rich and powerful .This presumption did not stand well with the revolutionary ideas that all people are equal in the eyes of their Creator and that government derived from the consent of the governed -- ideas that propelled the American Revolution and gave rise to the Democratic - Republican Party .The elitist view lurked within Massa - chusetts ' Adams family .John Adams was the first president to lose a re - election bid -- in fact , the only one - term president until his son joined him .John Quincy Adams , an elitist like his father , believed that his own responsibility as a leader and an officeholder was to listen not to the people who put him there , but only to his own inner voice .As early American democracy evolved , Adams ' elitist views were grotesquely out of fashion .By the election of 1824 , most states ( 9 out of 24 ) allowed the citizens to vote directly for presidential electors .This was democratic progress ; however , by now presidential nominees were selected by partisan congressional caucuses .Since there was just one political party , the Democratic - Republicans , whoever \" King Caucus \" picked became president .But in 1819 , battle - scarred Gen. Andrew Jackson of Tennessee ran for president against the caucus system .And Jackson had climbed from childhood poverty to become a very wealthy landowner and slaveholder .A man of common birth who 'd succeeded in war and real estate deserved a shot at replacing those upper - class twits who 'd lost control of the economy , members of the elite like House Speaker Henry Clay of Kentucky -- and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams .In 1824 , both Clay and Adams , like Sen. Jackson , saw the opportunity to put an end to King Caucus ' selection of presidents , and each saw his own best chance at the presidency .According to Congressional Quarterly 's Presidential Elections Since 1789 : .\" When the electoral votes were counted , Jackson had 99 , Adams 84 , Crawford 41 , and Clay 37 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.83873"}

{"text": "Brownback appointed accountant Steve Anderson , who had developed a model budget for the Kochs ' advocacy arm , Americans for Prosperity , as his budget director .Another Koch - linked group , the Kansas Policy Institute , supported his controversial tax proposals .As Brownback later explained to The Wall Street Journal , \" My focus is to create a red - state model that allows the Republican ticket to say , ' See , we 've got a different way , and it works . '\" The heart of his program consisted of drastic tax cuts for the wealthy and eliminating taxes on income from profits for more than 100,000 Kansas businesses .No other state had gone this far .He was advised by the godfather of supply - side economics himself , the Reagan - era economist Arthur Laffer , who described the reforms as \" a revolution in a cornfield . \" Not surprisingly , things have not worked out well in a state run based upon far right wing principles : .By June of 2014 , the results of Brownback 's economic reforms began to come in , and they were n't pretty .During the first fiscal year that his plan was in operation , which ended in June , the tax cuts had produced a staggering loss in revenue - $ 687.9 million , or 10.84 percent .According to the nonpartisan Kansas Legislative Research Department , the state risks running deficits through fiscal year 2019 .Moody 's downgraded the state 's credit rating from AA1 to AA2 ; Standard & Poor 's followed suit , which will increase the state 's borrowing costs and further enlarge its deficit .Brownback had also promised that his tax cuts would vault Kansas ahead of its higher - taxed neighbors in job growth , but that , too , failed to happen .In Kansas , jobs increased by 1.1 percent over the last year , compared with 3.3 percent in neighboring Colorado and 1.5 percent in Missouri .From November to May , Kansas had actually lost jobs , and the labor participation rate was lower than when Brownback took office .The cuts did not necessarily slow job growth , but they clearly did not accelerate it .And the effects of Brownback 's education cuts were also glaring larger class sizes , rising fees for kindergarten , the elimination of arts programs , and laid - off janitors and librarians .This is not to say that Kansas will support liberal Democrats , but as Sean Sullivan argued on Friday , the state may be more moderate than meets the eye .Or perhaps they are just sane enough to recognize failed policies .Hopefully this will overcome any temptation to cast a vote against Obama as many in red states are likely to do .It continues to look like Kansas might have a bearing on which party controls the Senate .As I previously discussed , with the Democratic candidate dropping out of the Kansas Senate race , independent Greg Orman has a real chance of defeating Republican Pat Roberts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.658905"}

{"text": "After Democratic candidate Chad Taylor dropped out , Orman led in the polls but the anti - Roberts vote was split when Taylor was listed .In order to improve Roberts ' chances , Kansas Secretary of State Chris Korbach ( who is also a member of Roberts ' honorary campaign committee ) played politics and refused to take Taylor 's name off the ballot .The Kansas Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that Taylor 's name should be removed from the ballot now that he has dropped out .Kansas election law does provide for the ability of the Democratic Party to name a replacement after Taylor dropped out , but obviously they have no intention of doing so .Korbach is claming that the Democrats are required to name a replacement , but it is rather absurd that a party must run a candidate if they do not desire to do so .Rick Hasen , an election law expert from the University of California , Irvine , said that it was unlikely that Kobach would be able to force the Democrats to name a replacement for Taylor .\" If Democrats refuse to name or no candidate agrees to serve , then what ?It seems like it would be a tough First Amendment claim to FORCE a party to name a replacement , \" Hasen wrote in an analysis .\" Perhaps if Democrats do nothing Kobach will realize there 's not much he can do and drop the issue . \"Despite his current lead , it is still possible that the Republicans can hold onto the seat .The national party is taking over management of Roberts ' campaign , and has called in Bob Dole to help secure the seat .Even if Orman maintains his current lead in the polls and wins , there is no guaranteed that he will caucus with the Democrats .With the battle for control of the Senate so close , it is certainly possible that he could wind up casting the deciding vote .In late August I wrote about the Senate race in Kansas , where there was felt to be a real chance of defeating Republican Pat Roberts if the Democratic candidate , Chad Taylor were to drop out .In that situation , polls show that independent Greg Orman has a real chance to beat Roberts .Orman has run as a Democrat in the past , and Democrats hope that he will caucus with them if he wins .Taylor did drop out of the race on Wednesday , increasing the chances that the Democrats can retain control of the Senate .While there has been speculation that the Democrats might be able to beat the incumbent Republican in Georgia or Kentucky , this probably does make Roberts the most vulnerable Republican .One reason that Orman out polls Roberts in a two - way race is that Roberts has run a poor campaign .In response , the national Republican Party now seeks to take control of the Roberts campaign .This further shows that they do feel that Roberts is now vulnerable .Different pundits differ on how much of a difference this will make .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.9171"}

Bush was gay .According to a group of 29 Yale classmates who comprise Gay Ivy Leaguers for Truth , Bush was ' known to be at least sexually experimental throughout his time in college . '\" One of Bush 's alleged former boyfriends , Anthony Berusca ( Class of ' 70 ) , told The Dallas Morning News that Bush was ' deeply conflicted about being gay , even somewhat self - hating . 'Berusca is convinced that this conflict led to Bush 's drinking problems , but describes the President as a ' gentle , caring lover . '\" In 1986 , the Bush family arranged for George to join Worthy Creations , a church group in El Paso that focuses on converting homosexuals through faith .A year later , Bush claimed to be straight , born again , and engaged to Laura Welch ( Kitty Kelly in \" The Family \" wrote that Bush 's twin daughters were not his offspring , but from a donor at a fertility clinic ) .And what is Skull and Bones ?Confession and blackmail are part of the rites of initiation for the Order , as new members must divulge their sexual histories to other Bonesmen , so they will always be compliant in the future .Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and former President George Herbert Walker Bush are also members of the Order of Skull and Bones .It was noted that Kerry , allegedly running against fellow Bonesman George Bush Jr. in the 2004 election , rolled over and played dead during most of his \" campaign .The admission of fake reporter/ male prostitute Jeff Gannon ( aka James Guckert ) to the White House and his unexplained sleepovers have added more evidence to a Gay White House with wags now claiming that GOP stands for ' Gay Old Party .
