Janes , executive director of Statewide Legal Services , Inc. , was installed as the Connecticut Bar Association 's ( CBA ) president , taking office on July 1st for the 2005 - 2006 year .Janes has long been a leading figure in the Connecticut legal services community , serving as executive director of Connecticut Legal Services from 1980 to 1995 .In addition to his work in legal aid , Janes has held a variety of leadership positions with the CBA , having served as secretary , treasurer , and vice president .He is believed to be the first career legal services attorney to be named as a state bar association president .Opinions .REVITALIZING PUBLIC SERVICE MISSION Michael Greco , The National Law Journal - August 1 , 2005 .It is my great honor to serve as the 129th president of the American Bar Association during what promises to be a momentous year for the legal profession and our country .Our plate is more than full .Scores of thousands of lawyers throughout America provide pro bono legal services and engage in wonderful public service activities that benefit our communities in countless ways .They embody the idealism of our profession , they make us proud and I salute them .It is in this spirit of public service that I am calling for a Renaissance of Idealism in our profession .I want to help reinvigorate and re - energize our commitment to pro bono and public service work , to enable even greater numbers of our lawyers to honor that commitment - and then nurture and expand it for generations of lawyers to come .To help me implement this initiative , I have appointed the ABA Commission on the Renaissance of Idealism in the Legal Profession .U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Theodore C.

Dana Jr. , associate justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court and former member of the Legal Services Corp. , is chairing the task force .This group will examine efforts to expand access to justice to the nation 's poor , with a particular focus on the very successful and expanding work of state - level access - to - justice commissions that the ABA helped to launch several years ago .I will also ask the task force to consider the idea of a defined right to counsel in certain serious civil cases .In the 1962 decision in Gideon v. Wainwright , the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that under our Constitution , an indigent caught up in the criminal justice system must be provided a lawyer before he or she may be imprisoned behind bars of steel .But 43 years after Gideon , we have not yet recognized such a right for poor Americans facing equally serious civil legal problems - problems that they can not address without the help of counsel and which threaten to imprison them in chains of poverty or discrimination .I look forward to working with the lawyers of America to advance the cause of equal justice for all .American lawyers have the idealism , the capacity and the commitment to serve the public and advance the noblest purposes of the legal profession .If we devote the time and energy to honor our idealism and our commitment , we will accomplish great things for the American people and our society .I invite all lawyers to join in the ABA 's important efforts and initiatives during the coming year .Michael S. Greco was installed as president of the ABA at the organization 's annual meeting held earlier this month in Chicago .He has named LSC President Helaine M. Barnett and LSC Board Member David Hall to the Task Force on Access to Civil Justice .Client Success Story .SUCCESS STORY FROM THE LEGAL AID FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES ( LAFLA ) .RANCHO LOS AMIGOS REHAB TO STAY OPEN AND BEDS SAVED AT COUNTY USC MEDICAL CENTER August 10 , 2005 .LAFLA , joined by other groups including Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County , recently announced the settlement of a federal lawsuit against the County of Los Angeles filed on behalf of 10 indigent patients and two groups .A federal injunction prevented the county from closing Rancho Los Amigos Rehabilitation Center , the only such rehab facility in the county for the uninsured , and reducing 100 beds at L.A.
