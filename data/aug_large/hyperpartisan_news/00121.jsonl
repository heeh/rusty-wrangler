{"text": "( Randall Benton / Sacramento ... ) .The state plan to overhaul the hub of California 's water system will cost nearly $ 25 billion to build and operate , according to preliminary figures released Wednesday .The proposal , backed by Gov. Jerry Brown 's administration and the Obama administration , calls for habitat restoration and the construction of two enormous tunnels to divert water from the Sacramento River and carry it under the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta to southbound pumps .Water users , including San Joaquin Valley irrigation districts and urban agencies in Southern California and the Bay Area , would bear roughly two - thirds of the cost , with the rest coming from federal and state sources .The proposal - in the planning stages for seven years - represents the biggest water supply project in California since the 1960s launch of the State Water Project under Brown 's father , Gov. Pat Brown .But important questions are hanging over it , in particular whether federal fishery agencies will approve operating rules that will deliver the volume of water sought by the contractors who will pay for most of the project .By building a diversion point on the river in the north delta and restoring more than 100,000 acres of habitat , the contractors hope to escape the endangered species restrictions that have reduced their water deliveries from the delta .Citing an economic analysis , state water officials said the value of benefits the project would provide outweighed costs by 35 % to 40 % .Proponents said the new diversion would improve the quality of water deliveries by taking some supplies north of tidal influences and runoff from delta farms .It would also stabilize export amounts by taking less water from the existing , fish - killing south delta facilities and make the water system less vulnerable to earthquake damage .Under the estimates released by the state , building the tunnels , three large intakes on the river and associated facilities would cost $ 14.5 billion .Operations and maintenance would amount to $ 4.8 billion over the 50-year life of the project .Habitat restoration , which would be funded with state bonds and federal appropriations , would cost $ 4.1 billion .Since most of the money would come from water users , their participation in the project is crucial .And they are reserving final commitment until still - evolving details of the plan are firmed up .\" We 've got to be able to say we can make it work under all conditions , \" said Roger Patterson , assistant general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California , which imports supplies from the delta .\" There will be some judgment as to where we think things may or may not go ....Under the worst - case scenario , does it still work for us ? \"Depending on what operating rules the fishery agencies demand to protect endangered native fish , delta deliveries could increase or decrease compared to the average of the last two decades .If they fall , the water contractors must decide if the project is worth it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.698463"}

{"text": "The National Irrigation Association was founded in 1899 to press for federal legislation .In 1896 Senator Warren secured a federal reservoir survey in order to provide support for federal flood control .The survey was led by Captain Hiram Martin Chittenden of the Army Corps of Engineers .11 Chittenden visited many areas in the West to examine potential reservoir sites , and he met with leaders of the reclamation movement .His report to Congress in 1897 provided support for federal dams in some locations but not others .Irrigation advocates used a variety of arguments in favor of federal aid for dam - building .Crittenden believed that federal aid was necessary because \" private enterprise can never accomplish the work successfully .\" 12 Other advocates argued that federal dams were needed to control floods in the West .That argument was pressed after major floods occurred , such as when the Imperial Valley in California flooded in 1891 .Another argument for federal support was the view that irrigation would spur western population growth , which would be good for the whole nation .Irrigation would provide opportunities for poor Americans to gain access to land , which would decrease social unrest .This \" safety valve \" thesis was an important part of the 19th century political debate .Wesley Jones , a representative and later a senator from Washington , for example , posited that putting people on small farms in the West was good for social order because wage laborers in the East could be subject to \" anarchist disorder and revolution .\" There were some very dubious arguments in favor of federal irrigation aid .One widely believed theory was that irrigated farming would increase rainfall in formerly arid regions - rain would \" follow the plow \" it was said .That theory turned out to be false .Another argument , made by Frederick Newell , the chief hydrologist for the U.S. Geological Survey and later the first director of the Reclamation Service , was that there would be spillover effects from irrigation - irrigation from surface water would create increases in western groundwater .15 That idea is no longer supported .In 1901 Francis Newlands , a representative and later a senator from Nevada , introduced the first major legislation for federal construction of dams .The bill failed to pass , but the national mood was changing .All of the major political parties - the Democrats , Republicans , and the short - lived Silver Republicans - included support for federal irrigation in their platforms .16And by this time , the Geological Survey was preparing plans for reclamation projects at 147 specific sites .In 1902 another reclamation bill was introduced and President Theodore Roosevelt provided his strong support .The act passed easily in the Senate , but there was opposition in the House , with 146 voting in favor and 55 against it .18 Representative William Hepburn from Iowa called federal irrigation \" larceny \" because it benefited private property owners at the expense of the general public .19 Others resisted federal dam building as a step towards socialism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.96196"}

Paul Douglas of Illinois - a PhD economist - lambasted these projects relentlessly when they were being considered in Congress .But in the end , the economics of the projects did n't matter , only the political drive for Reclamation to spend money in certain states did .As Reisner notes , California had won a series of big projects from Reclamation , so now it was the turn of the Upper Basin region of the Colorado River to win some .So the projects were approved , even though power production and irrigation did n't make much sense in the region .That sort of political logic was then transferred to Arizona .If California , Colorado , and other states got big projects , why should n't Arizona ?Arizona is one of the driest states in the nation , but it has groundwater sources that had long provided water for irrigation in the state .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.82754"}

{"text": "In the early 1980s , Reclamation officials learned the drainwater contained the trace element selenium .It had entered the Kesterson food chain , killing all but one fish species and triggering grotesque deformities in bird embryos .There was a huge public outcry and in 1985 , the Reagan Administration announced the Kesterson ponds would be closed .Famed Reclamation Commission Floyd Dominy , who headed the dam - building agency from 1959 to 1969 , later said he never should have commenced water deliveries to Westlands before resolving the drainage problem .\" I made a terrible mistake by going ahead with Westlands at the time we did , \" he said .In 1998 Westlands sued the federal government contending the 1960 Congresssional act and its contracts with Reclamation required the federal government to build a drain .Judge Wanger agreed but reaffirmed Westlands would have to pay for a drainage system .By the late 1990s estimates of a bird - safe drainage disposal system was estimated at $ 1 to $ 3 billion for 600 Westlands growers .In 2000 , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed Wanger 's conclusion that a drainage system had to be built but said Reclamation did not necessarily have to build the drain canal to the Delta as authorized in the 1960 San Luis Act .Instead , the Ninth Circuit said , Reclamation could experiment with other methods of treating the drainage , including reverse osmosis , recycling , and using the tainted drainwater to grow salt - tolerant crops .The Ninth Circuit ruling stated : . \" [ W]e agree with the district court that the Department of Interior must act to provide drainage service .The Bureau of Reclamation has studied the problem for over two decades .In the interim , lands within Westlands are subject to irreparable injury caused by agency action unlawfully withheld .The court ruling said the government must \" act promptly \" and \" without delay \" to find a solution .That was 11 years ago .Like I said , things move slowly in the Drainage World .In 2007 , the Bureau Record of Decision ( ROD ) considered several different solutions .One solution , which could cost $ 2.6 billion , called for retiring 140,894 salted up acres of Westlands acreage and another 14,467 acres in the federal water districts north of Westlands , an area known as the Grasslands .Drainage facilities would be built in both the Westlands and the Grasslands area .Economic losses of this proposal were estimated at $ 10.2 million a year .A second option , bitterly opposed by Westlands , called for retiring all 253,894 selenium - tainted acres in Westlands and build drainage and treatment facilities for 66,533 acres of impaired land in the Grasslands area .The economic gain would be $ 3.6 million a year .Not surprisingly , the Bureau , prodded by Westlands and its Congressional allies , chose the money - losing option which conflicted with federal rules requiring agencies to select options with the greatest overall benefit .To overcome this little problem , Department of Interior official Bennett Raley , during the George W. Bush Administration , issued a special exemption .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.164474"}

Frazier called the findings \" particularly troubling \" because of the agency 's long - standing efforts to improve its handling of biological opinions .In May , Lecky , identified as a senior adviser for intergovernmental programs for the fisheries service , testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on the Endangered Species Act and ways to make it work more smoothly .Against the light of the inspector general 's opinion , Lecky 's testimony seemed especially compelling .In his prepared remarks , Lecky said the agency \" understands the importance of improving the quality of conclusions drawn from data used to implement the Endangered Species Act and ensuring that decisions are based on the best data available . \"\" This has proved difficult in situations where policy decisions must be made when the information is limited , \" he said .Westlands Drainage Delay No . 389 .Nearly 60 years ago the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began working on a drainage system for the problem - plagued high selenium soils of the western San Joaquin Valley .Following an hour - long hearing , Wanger granted the Westlands ' motion over the protests of the older federal irrigation districts which are downslope , and to the north , of the Westlands , which is located in western Fresno and Kings counties .To say that progress on the Westlands drainage problem has been glacial in pace would be incorrect because glaciers now are melting as fast as an Anthony Weiner underwear photo moves around the Twitter universe .So let 's just say progress , if that is what it actually is , is made at a snail 's pace and is measured in decades .To refresh your memories , in 1955 the Bureau unveiled a plan for a $ 7 million earthen canal to carry Westlands ' salt - loaded drainwater to the eastern edge of the Delta .The San Luis Unit of the federal Central Valley Project was approved by Congress in 1960 and by then a much more expensive cement - lined drain canal to the Delta was envisioned .Downslope farming interests and Delta / Bay area farming interests opposed completion of a drain to the Delta and by the mid-1970s construction of the San Luis Drain was halted in a wetlands area north of Los Banos in Merced County and evaporation ponds were built to hold the water .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.8002"}
