{"text": "Democrats usually hold an advantage in this combined measure of party affiliation .In fact , the only year Republicans held a notable edge since Gallup began tracking independents ' political leanings was in 1991 , the year Republican President George H.W. Bush 's approval ratings soared after the United States ' victory in the Persian Gulf War .Democrats ' high point came in 2008 , in the final year of George W. Bush 's administration and the year Barack Obama was first elected president .However , the three - point Democratic advantage for all of 2014 obscures the change that occurred during the year .On a quarterly basis , Democrats started out 2014 with a five - point edge , similar to their advantage in 2013 .That dipped to two points by the third quarter .In the fourth quarter , likely in response to Republicans ' success in the 2014 midterm elections , Republicans held a slight advantage of one point .Since 2008 , Americans have been increasingly reluctant to identify with either the Republican or Democratic Party , and now a record 43 % claimed political independence in 2014 .Given historical trends , 2015 could bring a new record , as the percentage identifying as independents typically increases in the year before a presidential election , averaging a 2.5-point increase in the last six such years .Although Democrats typically have an advantage in partisanship , that edge shrunk in 2014 and in the last months of the year the parties were essentially on equal footing .With each party controlling part of the federal government - Democrats the presidency and Republicans the Congress - they each will have a say in how the nation addresses its major challenges in the coming year .However , in recent years divided control of government has more often than not resulted in partisan gridlock , and Americans ' frustration with the frequent political stalemate is evident .Continued frustration with the government would likely encourage more Americans to identify as independents this year .Survey Methods .Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted January - December 2014 , with a combined random sample of 16,479 adults , aged 18 and older , living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia .For results based on the total sample of national adults , the margin of sampling error is \u00b11 percentage point at the 95 % confidence level .All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting .Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50 % cellphone respondents and 50 % landline respondents , with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region .Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random - digit - dial methods .New Emails Reveal Obama White House Worked on Concocting Benghazi Lie DURING the Attacks .The still classified Obama State Department email , according to Issa , shows that the Obama White House rushed to settle on the false narrative of the anti - Islamic YouTube video instigating the attacks , which was completely at odds with the conclusions reached by reports from the ground .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.813255"}

Marco Rubio finishes a close third .Supporters of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas delivered a hard - fought upset win over businessman Donald Trump in the Iowa Republican caucuses Monday night , making good on his bet that a methodical campaign organization would eclipse the New Yorker 's media dominance in the first test of GOP voters .With 99 percent of the precincts reporting , Cruz was besting Trump by more than 5,100 votes , with fellow senator Marco Rubio of Florida a close third .Cruz appeared to capitalize on deep support from religious and social conservatives and showed that old - fashioned retail politicking could overcome Trump 's massive political rallies in the Hawkeye state .The final Des Moines Register poll is in ahead of today 's Iowa Caucus , and it shows that Donald Trump has the support of 28 % of likely caucus goers , with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 23 % and Florida Sen.

{"text": "Clinton 's record on these topics does fit well in the GOP mainstream .I am hesitant to write about winners because we have learned that the winner of a debate is not based upon the debate itself , but the perception of the candidates after people have listened to the talking heads in the days following the debate .This is further complicated with the Republican Party as most of their voters receive their thoughts from Fox .Criticism from the Fox commentators could make Donald Trump look like a loser , but so far he has managed to survive better than the pundits have predicted , and it is not looking like Fox will be successful against him .From my perspective , which could be quite different from that of Fox , the winners were John Kasich and Marco Rubio .Kasich barely squeaked into the prime time debate , and the two debates did show that Kasich really did deserve to be there more than Rick Perry , who was excluded , possibly by fudging the results of the polls .Kasich and Jeb Bush looked the most stable in the group .Bush already has his position as top contender after Trump , but now Kasich might replace Scott Walker as the leading challenger to Bush and move into the top tier .I also downgraded Bush for his discussion of his brother 's policies .It was n't faulty intelligence which got us in Iraq as he claimed , but his brother twisting the intelligence to justify the war he wanted to start .Jeb ! also seemed oblivious to the fact that ISIS and the other problems now occurring in Iraq are due to his brother destabilizing the region .They all seemed oblivious , when talking about the deficit , to the fact that the deficit is a consequence of George W. Bush both fighting the war on credit and cutting taxes on the wealthy .The other Republican who looked good , if you ignore his actual views , was Marco Rubio .He could make a good candidate in a television - based campaign .The entry of Trump into the race made it hard for candidates like Rubio to get attention , but he did get a shot at being noticed Thursday .On the other hand , it seemed a battle throughout the evening between Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz to be the most bat - shit candidate on stage , which was impressive considering that Donald Trump was on the same stage .I was edging towards awarding this to Huckabee , with lines such as , \" The purpose of the military is kill people and break things , \" until Cruz gave his closing statement , and clinched the title : .If I 'm elected president , let me tell you about my first day in office .The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama .The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.0222"}

{"text": "The catch is that it was only used three times since 1975 .They deserve some credit for correctly predicting victories for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford before many people had heard of Carter , and for predicting the election of Obama when many were ( as with Sanders now ) claiming he was unelectable .While I would love for this to be true , it is also very hard to accept the results in specific states , such as Sanders winning Mississippi and Georgia but losing in Hawaii and Maryland .Of course the claims of being right are limited to the final results and not accuracy of state by state predictions .A victory for Sanders , even if closer and involving a different set of states , would still be welcome .It is easy to dismiss this prediction , and I could not blame either Clinton or the Republicans for denying any meaning to it beyond the enthusiasm of college students for Sanders .The bigger question this year is whether we can believe the conventional polls , especially when they are being used to determine who qualifies for the debates , which can potentially influence the outcome .Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie have been eliminated from Tuesday 's main debate , along with George Pataki and Lindsay Graham being excluded from the undercard debate .Even some pollsters have argued that the polls should not be used in this manner .One problem is that the Republican candidates are too close together to use the polls to separate them .Then there is the question of whether the polls are all that accurate in predicting a primary election well before the vote .I 've followed the Democratic primaries far more closely , and have noted many times how little predictive value the polls have .This polling report from December 2007 described how Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Among the problems with these polls , many voters in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire do not decide until the last minute .People are far more likely to switch between relatively similar members of their own party than they are to switch from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican in a general election .Pollsters also adjust the raw results based upon projections as to who will actually vote , but that is difficult to predict .Some polls this year are basing their prediction upon whether someone voted in previous Democratic primaries , but this excludes the people are who , at least from discussions on line , are saying they have just recently registered to vote Democratic in order to vote for Sanders .There is no good way to determine how many of these people , or how many who are turning out in huge numbers for Sanders events , will really vote .The results out of Iowa and New Hampshire could radically alter the results in subsequent states when the media covers the winners more favorably and voters see them in a new light .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.597275"}

Tuchfarber has looked at the December polls and has also demonstrated how little predictive value they have .In polls from November 2007 , taken two months before voting , Hillary Clinton was leading the Democratic race .Rudy Guiliani was leading the Republican race , with Fred Thompson also ahead of John McCain .In 2011 Herman Cain was leading the Republican race , and had left the race by the time of the Iowa caucuses .One reason for the poor predictive value of national polls is that whoever wins in Iowa and/or New Hampshire generally gets a huge boost in subsequent states .That does n't mean that the polls in Iowa are all that more meaningful as voters there typically do n't make up their minds until the last minute .Hillary Clinton was leading in the polls in Iowa and came in third place in 2008 .In late 2007 Mitt Romney was leading the polls in Iowa , and came in second to Mike Huckabee .Herman Cain was leading in Iowa as well as the national polls two months before the Iowa caucus .Polls also have limited predictive value as the pollsters do not know who will actually turn out to vote .If the Democratic caucus in Iowa is dominated by long time Democratic voters , then the polls are showing the race as very close .If those who have n't previously voted but are showing enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders turn out to vote , there could be a big victory for Sanders .The much stronger degree of support seen for Sanders in social media is very encouraging , but no guarantee of votes .It might also be helpful for Sanders that the Iowa caucuses are later this year than in the 2008 cycle , when many college students were off on vacation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.40402"}

Bernie Sanders ' 42 % .It is unbelievable that Sanders is so close in the polls to Hillary .Many are looking to gleam and info or data that will give us an indicator as to who might win in Iowa .In the final poll before the Iowa caucuses Monday , Donald Trump holds a slight 5-point lead over Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are neck - and - neck within the margin of error .The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics pool took place January 26 - 29 , three days before Trump skipped the GOP Iowa debate to one day after .This particular poll , which has a history of accuracy as it predicted Rick Santorum 's late surge in 2012 , shows Donald Trump as the frontrunner , but still a close race with two days to go .Trump will need the help of first - time caucus - goers to boost his chances of beating Cruz and in this poll , 40 percent say their caucusing for their first time .Trump does have weaknesses , though , in the eyes of Iowa voters who do n't like his position on eminent domain and past statements in favor of abortion rights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.21952"}

Mike Huckabee said he had cut his state budget by 11 percent during the 2001 - 2003 recession .Over his entire tenure , however , spending went up by 50 percent .Jindal claimed that there were \" more people working in Louisiana than ever before .\" That 's wrong .There were fewer Louisianans working in September than there were in December 2014 .Huckabee said that Syrians make up only 20 percent of the refugees arriving in Europe .The figure is actually 52 percent for 2015 .The above electoral map prediction from Western Illinois University has received a lot of attention , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders , for showing Sanders winning in a landslide .Some argue that we should take this seriously because the mock election model has been right in every election it was used in since 1975 .The catch is that it was only used three times since 1975 .They deserve some credit for correctly predicting victories for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford before many people had heard of Carter , and for predicting the election of Obama when many were ( as with Sanders now ) claiming he was unelectable .While I would love for this to be true , it is also very hard to accept the results in specific states , such as Sanders winning Mississippi and Georgia but losing in Hawaii and Maryland .Of course the claims of being right are limited to the final results and not accuracy of state by state predictions .A victory for Sanders , even if closer and involving a different set of states , would still be welcome .It is easy to dismiss this prediction , and I could not blame either Clinton or the Republicans for denying any meaning to it beyond the enthusiasm of college students for Sanders .The bigger question this year is whether we can believe the conventional polls , especially when they are being used to determine who qualifies for the debates , which can potentially influence the outcome .Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie have been eliminated from Tuesday 's main debate , along with George Pataki and Lindsay Graham being excluded from the undercard debate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.03194"}
