Hodges , Professor of Law , University of Richmond School of Law .In a blog post following the Supreme Court 's decision last term in Harris v.

{"text": "If Roe v. Wade were overturned .Despite its conservative ruling in the partial - birth abortion case , a majority of the current Supreme Court remains likely to uphold Roe v.

Wade were overturned .Whether a state chooses to ban abortion will depend on what party controls the governor 's mansion and the legislature , and on the social leanings of its citizens , if and when federal restrictions are lifted .But signs can be gleaned from states ' recent records on the issue .On Nov. 7 , South Dakota voters will decide whether their Legislature reflected local political will when it passed the strictest abortion ban in the country this year .On the anti - abortion side , four states already have in place so - called trigger laws , designed to make abortion illegal if federal policy permits .Three other states passed laws called statements of policy , establishing the illegality of abortion as an overriding state philosophy .In addition , a few states have pre-1973 abortion bans still on the books , which legal experts say could be reinstated .Abortion bans passed by Louisiana and Utah in 1991 that were immediately struck down by federal courts also remain on the books in both states and could take effect if Roe v. Wade fell , legal experts say .On the abortion - rights side , seven states have codified the principles of Roe v. Wade in state law , and high courts in nine other states have interpreted the state constitution as independently ensuring a woman 's right to an abortion .Trigger laws and statements of policy : Trigger laws ban abortion but avoid a federal lawsuit by delaying the effective date until the Supreme Court allows states to make abortion illegal again .This year , Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour ( R ) signed a trigger law that would ban abortions except in cases of rape or threat to the woman 's life .Illinois was the first to pass a trigger law in 1975 .Louisiana followed in 1981 and Kentucky in 1982 .South Dakota passed a trigger law in 2005 and , in 2006 Louisiana updated and added teeth to its 1981 trigger law .Legal experts differ on whether trigger laws would automatically take effect if Roe v. Wade were overturned .Some say the laws - in - waiting would be subject to approval by the incumbent governor and attorney general , if not lawmakers .Three states , Arkansas ( 1988 ) , Missouri ( 1974 and 1986 ) and North Dakota ( 1975 ) , passed similar but weaker laws , called statements of policy , that establish their intention to outlaw abortion if federal prohibitions are lifted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.39088"}

Andrew Cuomo has spoken of removing \" ineffective teachers \" and expanding charter schools , prompting the New York State United Teachers to launch a media campaign to \" fight back \" against the governor 's agenda . \" Education is our life .For this you have made us the enemy .This is personal , \" a group of teachers said in an open letter to Cuomo printed Monday in the Times Union of Albany .The Chicago Teachers Union has lofted similar rhetoric against Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel , a Democrat .CTU President Karen Lewis even considered challenging Emanuel in the current mayoral election , though eventually she dropped out , citing health reasons .Emanuel and Rauner , it happens , are friends and former business associates from Emanuel 's time at the investment firm Wasserstein Perella in the late 1990s .Although Emanuel endorsed Rauner 's opponent , incumbent Gov. Pat Quinn , in November 's election , and though the two disagree on many issues , Emanuel and Rauner are , one Democratic strategist told the Chicago Tribune in August , \" cut from the same cloth .\" One point of agreement is a keen frustration with the CTU .In addition to differences over education reform , Democratic politicians have sometimes clashed with public - employee unions over pensions that are squeezing state budgets .Here , too , Illinois features prominently , because nowhere does the state pension problem weigh more heavily .The state 's Democratic attorney general , Lisa Madigan , is arguing in court for emergency powers to trim state pension benefits .In short , government costs more but does less . \" Such pressures are felt by Republicans and Democrats alike - indeed , so much so that some Democrats now openly pronounce themselves anti - union .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.54904"}

Wade , the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments last year on two cases that could profoundly affect states ' ability to restrict abortion .In both cases , lower courts struck down a federal law prohibiting so - called partial - birth abortions , the only nationwide ban on an abortion procedure .The outcome of those cases could affect states because justices may take another look at a key tenet of earlier holdings - that abortion must be allowed if deemed necessary to protect a woman 's health and well - being .In a 7-to-2 decision , the justices in Roe v. Wade ensured that abortion would be legal in all 50 states .That ruling and subsequent decisions prevent states from outlawing abortion except for late in pregnancy when a fetus can live outside of the womb , and then only if the mother 's physical or mental health will not be adversely affected .Still , getting an abortion in some states is difficult .Local laws , culture and politics create widely varying experiences for women seeking to end their pregnancies .In South Dakota , for example , a woman may have to travel as far as 400 miles to the one abortion clinic in the state , which is picketed daily and run by a doctor who travels from Minnesota .South Dakota doctors refuse to perform the procedure because they say all other patients would boycott them in the sparsely populated , conservative state .By contrast , in New York , nearly all women have access to a clinic in their local community , and a woman of any age can receive an abortion , no questions asked , without counseling or waiting .In Massachusetts and Rhode Island , an underage woman seeking an abortion must get her parents ' permission , but in neighboring Connecticut , Vermont and Maine , she can end her pregnancy without her parents ' knowledge .In both Texas and Mississippi , a woman must undergo counseling , wait 24 hours , and if she 's a minor , get her parents ' consent before receiving an abortion .But because of different state rules for abortion providers , a majority of women in Texas have local access to an abortion clinic , while women in Mississippi have only one clinic , which the state has threatened to shut down .For a variety of reasons , the number of abortion providers varies widely from state to state , according to information compiled by the Guttmacher Institute , an abortion - rights nonprofit research organization .In Hawaii , every woman has an abortion provider in her county .With a population of about 1.2 million , the state is home to 51 providers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.809696"}

Casey , the Supreme Court upheld Roe by a single vote .Although Roe was saved , Justice O'Connor 's opinion watered down the strict scrutiny standard and replaced it with a vague \" undue burden \" test .That test has allowed restrictions on abortions ranging from waiting periods and biased counseling .In addition , since Roe , the Supreme Court has cut back on the availability of abortion by upholding requirements that minors get their parent 's consent or a court order and allowing states to deny poor women public funding for abortion , even when necessary for health reasons .We need courts that will protect not only the abstract right in Roe , but its application to ensure that abortion remains an available option for all women . posted:7/2/2003 2:01:00 PM CST .Carlie Steen : The Center was the only reproductive rights organization who issued a statement about the Lawrence v.

Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 , 399 ( 1923 ) .These decisions make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed \" fundamental \" or \" implicit in the concept of ordered liberty , \" Palko v.

Planned Parenthood of Northern New England that a New Hampshire parental notification law must allow doctors to quickly perform an abortion in medical emergencies without notifying parents .In March 2007 , the New Hampshire House voted to repeal the law ; the Senate is expected to approve the repeal as well , and Gov. John Lynch ( D ) has said he would sign the bill .States have passed two types of parental involvement laws .Parental consent laws require one or both parents to approve of the procedure in writing ; parental notification laws simply require doctors to notify parents before performing an abortion on a minor .Most laws require 48 hours notice and set the age of a minor at 18 .In November 2006 , voters in California and Oregon rejected proposals to join 35 other states in preventing teenage girls from getting abortions without a parent 's knowledge .Oregon voters had rejected a similar proposal in 1990 and California voters nixed a parental involvement law in 2005 .Florida voters approved a 2004 ballot measure requiring parental consent , and in 1998 Colorado voters approved a parental notification measure .Connecticut , Hawaii , New York , Oregon , Vermont and Washington are the only states with no laws requiring parental involvement in a minor 's abortion decision .Nine states - Alaska , California , Idaho , Illinois , Montana , Nevada , New Hampshire , New Jersey and New Mexico - have passed parental involvement statutes that were immediately rejected by courts for violating privacy and equal - protection clauses in their state constitutions .In an unusual case , the Illinois Supreme Court in September issued judicial bypass rules for a 1995 parental notice law that was enjoined by a court for lacking those rules .State Attorney General Lisa Madigan is reviewing the case to determine whether to ask the lower state court to resurrect the 11-year - old statute .Illinois is the only state in the Midwest that does not enforce a parental involvement law .Nationwide , 22 states enforce parental consent laws requiring at least one parent to sign a statement approving the procedure .Of the 22 , only Mississippi and North Dakota require both parents to approve the procedure .Twelve other states enforce parental notification laws .Utah enforces both consent and notification laws .Maine , North Carolina , South Carolina and Wisconsin allow girls alternatives to parental consent such as the consent of a grandparent or sibling , a doctor - authorized waiver , or state - approved counseling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.061043"}

Pat Quinn .Story Continued Below .Rauner has on his staff four Kirk alumni in his effort to replicate the moderate GOP senator 's path to blue - state victory .And like Kirk - and unlike Republicans in almost everywhere else in the country - Rauner avoids bashing President Barack Obama , who remains popular in his home state .It is all part of a recipe for victory Rauner 's team is banking on working again four years later in what is shaping up to be one of the most expensive and nastiest governor 's races in the country .\" It 's a winning strategy to be a social moderate and a fiscal conservative , which is exactly what the state is , \" Kirk said earlier this week during an interview at the Capitol .Rauner would n't even be running if state Sen.

Rod Blagojevich - by 19,000 votes out of more than 3.6 million cast .Brady tried again this year but finished third in the primary .The case for Quinn 's vulnerability is simple : He 's the leader of a dysfunctional state government that sent his two predecessors to federal prison .He raised state income taxes after saying he would n't , and the state 's finances are still a mess .And by signing a pension - reform deal , Quinn alienated the public - sector unions that make up the Democratic base .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.40933"}

Quinn .This assault on working people stems from the Justices ' view that the care workers in the case are not \" real \" public employees and thus the union can not charge the appropriate agency fee to all of them for its bargaining services .This ruling serves the interests of anti - worker extremists at the expense of these invaluable workers who care for our families and our children .It 's clear : a majority of Justices are trampling over the rights of working women .In light of these attacks , it 's time to organize for gender equity and economic justice for working women .Back in 2010 when I was a student , Young People For helped me develop organizing skills that have led me to effectively advocate for and with women and workers .Through my work in student labor organizing as an undergraduate and since graduation , I have seen that workers ' rights are women 's rights , from having access to comprehensive healthcare to having a voice on the job .To build an economy that works for today 's students and youth , we need to organize locally and train new leaders in the broad effort to advance our agenda for gender equity and economic justice .The Supreme Court 's decisions last week underscored the urgency of organizing for these changes .Women 's access to equal rights , power in the workplace , and comprehensive healthcare depends on it .Days after the Supreme Court handed down its damaging 5 - 4 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby , SCOTUS issued an order that underscored the danger that Hobby Lobby poses for women 's health .In Wheaton College v. Burwell , SCOTUS temporarily granted relief to Wheaton College , a religious institution that is \" categorically \" opposed to providing contraceptive services , from the contraception coverage compromise solution that the Court explicitly endorsed in Hobby Lobby .The order says that Wheaton may be exempt from submitting a form that would inform the government that they object to covering birth control .Wheaton College argued that submitting this form would make it \" complicit in the provision of contraceptive coverage .\" The temporary order indicates that the Court 's majority may accept this problematic argument .In what Think Progress called a \" blistering dissent \" to the order , Justice Sonia Sotomayor - joined by the two other female Justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg - sharply criticized the order .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.60179"}

Wade ruling , which established constitutional protections for women seeking an abortion .While the makeup of the Supreme Court is the focus of much of today 's political calculations about the future of abortion in America , the role of states would become pivotal if the landmark decision were overturned .Any substantial weakening of Roe v.

Wade marked a new twist after 33 years in which most states have concentrated on whittling away at the edges of the landmark ruling .Since 1973 , all states except Vermont have passed one or more abortion laws , and states continue to enact new abortion statutes every year .The barrage of laws has triggered repeated court challenges that have refined what states can and ca n't do in trying to strike a balance between a woman 's constitutional right to end a pregnancy and religious and moral beliefs that abortion is wrong because it destroys fetal life .Unable to ban abortion , states have pioneered dozens of tactics to constrict access to it - from requiring minors to seek a parent 's consent for an abortion to regulating the size of doorways in clinics that perform the procedure .In contrast , 13 states help ensure a woman 's access to abortion by prohibiting most forms of protest at abortion clinics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.86902"}

Quinn , which prevented public unions from collecting fees from a small group of private - sector workers under contract with state governments .The court could have gone further to declare mandatory public - sector union fees unconstitutional , but it chose not to .Rauner 's suit appears designed to compel the Supreme Court to take a second look , and the court may be willing .And it may soon take up another case challenging mandatory teacher - union fees in California .Public - employee unions can mostly be expected to campaign against next year 's GOP primary field , and especially against Walker and Christie .One possible exception is the conservative International Association of Fire Fighters , whose president , Harold Schaitberger , met with Jeb Bush last month .Schaitberger said his 300,000-strong union is about 44 percent Republican .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.09267"}

{"text": "But the majority of states failed to loosen their laws , leaving women , including victims of rape and incest , few legal options .It was just such a situation in Texas that led Norma McCorvey , identified at the time by the alias Jane Roe , and her doctor to appeal the state law all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court , resulting in the Roe v. Wade decision .Legal precedents In 1973 , the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that a 19th century Texas law , which only allowed abortion to save a woman 's life , violated a woman 's constitutional right to privacy .In one of the most controversial decisions in Supreme Court history , the justices overturned all state laws prohibiting abortion and said states could only ban the procedure late in pregnancy when the fetus can live outside the womb .Even then , the court ruled that states must make an exception when a doctor deems it necessary to protect a woman 's life or health .In a second decision on the same day ( Doe v. Bolton ) , the court outlined what doctors may consider in determining whether abortion is necessary to protect a woman 's health .According to the court , \" all factors - physical , emotional , psychological , familial , and the woman 's age - relevant to the well - being of the patient \" may be taken into account .Anti - abortion activists argue that the health exception described in Doe v. Bolton is so broad that it has become the rule rather than the exception , allowing nearly all women who want a late - term abortion to have one .This fall , the high court will hear a case involving a federal ban on so - called partial - birth abortion methods that may address whether the health exception should be more narrowly defined .After Roe v. Wade , states repeatedly tested its boundaries , passing laws that made it difficult for some women to have an abortion .Many state laws were struck down by federal courts , and some appeals made it to the high court .For example , a Missouri law requiring a married woman to get her husband 's consent for an abortion was struck down in 1976 .A Minnesota law requiring minors to notify both parents before obtaining an abortion was overturned in 1990 , because it failed to provide exceptions when parents refuse to consent or can not be contacted .This ruling allowed states to require doctors to counsel women about the potential dangers of abortion , discuss alternatives such as adoption and impose waiting periods to give women time to reconsider their decision .This year , the high court departed from previous decisions - for the first time approving an abortion restriction without an exception to protect a woman 's health .In its April 18 , 2007 , Gonzalez v. Carhart decision , the court upheld the federal Partial - Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 , which prohibits a specific midterm procedure known as partial - birth abortion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.730774"}

Detroit Board of Education [ 431 U.S. 209 ( 97 S.Ct .1782 , 52 L.Ed.2d 261 ) ] divided union dues into two parts .One part is costs associated with providing union workers with a contract , the collective bargaining agreement with the employer , and its administration , the subsequent services of representation at adversarial meetings with management , grievances and arbitrations .Fees for those services are called \" fair use \" or \" agency \" fees .In other words , Abood said that non - members who benefit from union services have to help cover costs .The second part of union dues is \" expenditures for ideological causes not germane to its duties as a collective - bargaining .\" This has been dubbed the political activity of the union , including overt politicking , lobbying lawmakers for specific legislation and financial support for political candidates .People who object to this part of union activity can refuse to pay that portion of dues to the union .In the specific case before SCOTUS today , Friedrichs , plaintiffs are challenging California law .If a teacher wants to protest the political portion of the CTA dues , she or he can give the union a written objection - an \" opt out \" declaration .That portion of the contested fee is then refunded or a portion is reduced .The anti - union plaintiffs want that teacher to have to \" opt in \" and agree to the fees .Plaintiffs frame the issue as one of free choice and the First Amendment ( whether or not the non - administrative fees constitute speech ) .The Case 's Strange Origin .The union - busting groups , typically with a libertarian or right - wing political bent , found this case in order to abolish the last bastion of unionization in America - in government .The private sector unionization rate is now under 7 % .If government , public sector , unions can be further weakened , the U.S. labor movement will be effectively gutted .According to Maryann Parker , SEIU Associate General Counsel , speaking at an American Constitution Society expert panel , Friedrichs v.

{"text": "Although this issue will no doubt return repeatedly to the Court , it should decline to hear the case .The 1977 decision of the Court in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education correctly concluded that fair share fees are constitutional , and the decision should not be disturbed .Abood allows the union to charge for its mandated representational duties , but not for political expenditures .In this context , the objectors ' first amendment interests are reduced and the interests of the government employer that has entered into an agreement with the union enhanced .Justice Alito suggested in Harris , however , that all union activity in the government sector implicates the highest first amendment interests .This is at odds with the Court 's cases on the first amendment interests of public employees following Abood .In recent years , the Court has held that the government has stronger interests in restraining speech when it acts as an employer .Accordingly , when employees speak pursuant to their job duties , their speech is unprotected .Additionally , when an employee 's speech is about an internal workplace grievance , it is similarly unprotected by the first amendment .It is precisely these grievances that the union is obliged to handle for all employees regardless of membership .If speaking about the grievance is unprotected , why is compelling the unwilling employee to pay for this otherwise unprotected speech an interference with first amendment rights ?As Justice Kagan pointed out in the Harris dissent , the fact that it takes more money to pay multiple employees does not transform the character of the speech when the substance , asking for a raise , is the same .There are many other reasons for the Court to deny cert .Abood has been settled law for almost 40 years , Justice Alito 's efforts notwithstanding .As Justice Kagan ably pointed out in Harris , principles of stare decisis , including the reliance interests of thousands of employers and unions and millions of employees , counsel restraint .Moreover , as I have argued in earlier posts , fair share agreements are an essential pillar of the system of labor relations that has served our country well for 80 years .And finally , as pointed out in the opposition to cert , the record in this case has not been developed , as the plaintiffs rushed to accept Justice Alito 's invitation for an opportunity to overrule Abood . by Catherine Fisk , Chancellor 's Professor of Law , University of California Irvine School of Law .First , under Illinois law , government - paid and government - regulated home health - care workers are state employees .Justice Alito 's majority opinion in Harris disregarded state law when it invented a vague new category of non-\"full - fledged \" government employees who have greater First Amendment rights than other workers to refuse to pay the costs of union representation .Third , the Court failed to explain why fair share fees differ from compulsory payment of lawyers ' bar dues , which the Court approved in Keller v. California State Bar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.439575"}

Detroit Board of Ed . ] that states can \" require workers to pay partial dues ... to cover the union 's cost of negotiating their contracts and representing them in grievances .Illinois is among the states to require just that , \" according to Politico .The First Amendment prohibits the collection of an agency fee from Rehabilitation Program PAs who do not want to join or support the union .Pp . 8 - 40 . ...Finally , the Abood Court 's critical \" labor peace \" analysis rests on the unsupported empirical assumption that exclusive representation in the public sector depends on the right to collect an agency fee from nonmembers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.84695"}

Scott Walker curtailed collective bargaining and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie cut pension benefits for public employees in the name of budget austerity , state and local politicians once again are moving to curtail public - sector unions .The most aggressive moves are coming from Illinois ' newly inaugurated Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner .On Monday , Rauner issued an executive order prohibiting unions from collecting so - called fair share fees from non - union members .These mandatory fees come from government workers who choose not to be union members but are nonetheless represented by unions in contract negotiations .In effect , Rauner 's order by fiat makes Illinois a right - to - work state for public employees - a measure that , opponents argue , requires legislation .But some Democrats have lately put public - employee unions in the hot seat too .For Democrats , the target is typically teachers unions , whose frequent opposition to education reforms has proved infuriating to big - city mayors .Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has spoken of removing \" ineffective teachers \" and expanding charter schools , prompting the New York State United Teachers to launch a media campaign to \" fight back \" against the governor 's agenda . \" Education is our life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.30769"}
