{"text": "So , having buried the taboo , we seem to be in danger of giving it the kiss of life with the way some cases of alleged abuse are now being perceived .It 's quite right that all claims of sexual assault should be investigated , tested and , where there is a case , pursued through the judicial system .No one is above the law , whether a ' celebrity ' or a lord .But we seem to have lost a sense of perspective when it comes to these crimes with vast resources being allocated to a handful of cases while many thousands of reported incidents are virtually on hold .The police should never have to apologise for investigating crimes and following leads .However , if allegations are false or can not be substantiated they should say so .This would be a strength not a weakness .It is , of course , difficult that in many of the high - profile cases of recent times the identities of those under investigation have not been officially released by the police but have come to light through other means .Yet we have to deal with the world as it is not as we wish it would be and once names are common knowledge the results of the investigations centring on them should be made public .When it emerges that someone in the public eye is being investigated for historical child abuse it obviously stirs the interest of the media whose appetite can be insatiable .This puts pressure on the police who do n't want to repeat the mistakes of the past by allowing offenders to slip through their hands .And so there is a danger , as has been seen in recent cases , that officers lack confidence in declaring there is a lack of evidence or the allegations are not true .The disproportionate weight of media attention given to say , Sir Edward Heath , as opposed to the Bradford grooming gang sentenced this week , shows there is a danger the pendulum is swinging too far the other way .This threatens the painstaking work invested in ensuring the public and our institutions recognise child abuse as a very real danger .Whilst high profile cases have helped the cause there is now a real risk that the all - encompassing focus on them does both victims of abuse and those advocating on their behalf a fundamental disservice .As the public watches high -profile cases collapsing amidst a media fanfare genuine convictions made across the country week in week out go virtually unannounced .If this trend continues they may start to believe that child sexual abuse is n't the prolific problem we know it to be .So , while detectives peer into the mists of time , searching for long lost clues , we have to face the unpalatable possibility that offences being committed today will in turn become historical investigations because there is not the manpower to deal with them right now .Operation Midland , which was set - up to check claims that boys were abused in the 1970s and 80s by a high - level group of paedophiles including politicians , military figures and members of law enforcement agencies , has had up to 40 detectives assigned to it and a similar investigation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.12024"}

{"text": "Do n't tell Gwyneth ; it would break her heart .Gwyneth Paltrow : 4 Film Collection .US DVD : 3 Apr 2012 .There was a moment during the early 2000s when it seemed like Gwyneth Paltrow would become the queen of Hollywood .After winning , Paltrow 's career seems to have stalled as she got married and became a full time mother , now only gracing movie screens sporadically .United not by themes but by the presence of the lead actress , this boxset shows that Lionsgate needs to make the most out of the catalog titles it inherited from Miramax .At first she was thought to be a new princess of period pieces , playing ingenues in corsets with an assured charm and grace that made some people think she was British .In Douglas McGrath 's Emma , Paltrow plays the title role of Emma Woodhouse , a well intentioned young woman who decides she 'll become a matchmaker .Adapted from Jane Austen 's lovely novel , the film went by slightly unnoticed , given that just the year before it was released , the novel had been adapted for modern audiences in Clueless which became a ' 90s pop culture landmark .In spite of this , McGrath 's adaptation is just as significant because it 's one of the greatest Austen reworks and Paltrow is absolutely luminous as the heroine .After losing the lead in Titanic , Paltrow ended up starring in Shakespeare in Love , her Oscar winning turn which is also the centerpiece of this collection .Tom Stoppard 's inventive screenplay tries to figure out how William Shakespeare ( played with effervescent charm by Joseph Fiennes ) ended up writing Romeo and Juliet , and so creates the fictitious character of Viola de Lesseps , played by Paltrow .The movie itself is a joyous , clever comedy but it can be said that it 's a showcase for its leading actress .Up to that point Paltrow had starred in movies for which she was just too bright and she ended up looking too affected and even bored .In Shakespeare in Love she found a movie that truly matched her wit and effortless luminosity .Watching her play four different characters is n't especially fascinating from a technical point of view ( she 's certainly no Meryl Streep ) , but she shines with such sensuality and joy that you truly believe her Viola did indeed inspire Shakespeare .The film has its ups and downs , mostly because Affleck ca n't muster the energy to play someone who would deserve this woman 's love , problem which seems to be the major issue in Paltrow 's career .When she 's good , she 's absolutely brilliant , when she 's bad , she just seems deeply uninterested , as is the case in View from the Top , a movie that takes the concept of Legally Blonde and moves it to the skies .Paltrow plays Donna , a small town girl who dreams of becoming a flight attendant .The film follows her as she goes through airline - school ( Candice Bergen and Mike Myers are her professors ) falls in love ( with an extremely bland Mark Ruffalo ) and ultimately realizes that home is where the heart is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.66633"}

Fletcher .The film was amongst Chase 's biggest successes , inspiring a legion of devoted fans to memorize and quote its witty dialogue , as well as a shoddy sequel , 1989 's Fletch Lives .Studio execs have been working to develop a third Fletch film starring a hot new actor as a younger version of Fletch since as early as 1997 , with names like Kevin Smith , Zach Braff , and Chevy Chase himself at one point involved .Read on to learn about the Fletch reboot 's decades - long journey to the screen and the current status of the project .Universal gave Smith the go - ahead , and he planned on casting Kevin Smith Repertory Company players Joey Lauren Adams and Jason Lee , with Adams playing Fletch 's daughter and Lee playing her romantic interest .Smith even had plans for Chevy Chase to reprise his role as Irwin M. Fletcher and wanted Chase 's frequent costar Goldie Hawn to cameo .He took a lunch meeting with Chase to discuss the project and the two disagreed about using improv in Son of Fletch .Chase wanted to ad lib his way through the movie , while Smith wanted to stick to the script ; but both parties were still interested in working together .Smith put the project on hold while he worked on Dogma , telling Universal execs he did n't have time in his schedule for Fletch at that point .Chevy Chase complained about Smith to the press , saying \" It 's Hollywood - type crap treatment , so rude .I could have been writing a Fletch with someone else during that time .There 's no hard feelings , but I 've never done that to anybody . \"Smith responded to Chase with a characteristically long - winded screed on his website and left Chase out of his future plans for the Fletch series .Depending on how the end product turned out , this Fletch sequel could have been great for everyone involved .At the time , Jason Lee was almost a decade away from breaking through as a mainstream star .Assuming that it would have been better and more successful than Son of the Pink Panther or Son of the Mask , Son of Fletch could have opened a lot of doors for Jason Lee and allowed him to score more leading man roles .Chevy Chase , too , would have been helped by this one going through .By 1997 , he was fading from the public eye , no longer a major box office draw .Son of Fletch could have resurrected his career over a decade before Dan Harmon did so by casting him in Community .Given the popularity of the original Fletch films and the solid casting choice of Jason Lee , Son of Fletch could have been a sizeable hit and broken through to become Kevin Smith 's biggest success to date .Even Smith 's highest grossing films rarely surpass the $ 30 million mark .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.185715"}
