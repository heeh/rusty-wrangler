Ted Cruz .Cruz had previously disparaged the legacy of the \" neocons \" who prodded Bush into war in Iraq and championed a democracy crusade in the Middle East .In Las Vegas , he spoke of a new national - interest - based foreign policy , a policy that puts \" America First .\" If we topple Assad ...ISIS will take over Syria , and it will worsen national security interests .And the approach - instead of being ... a democracy promoter , we ought to hunt down our enemies and kill ISIS rather than creating opportunities for ISIS to control new countries .Cruz rejects the Manichaean worldview of the neocons and their reflexive hostility to Russia , and appears willing to work with a Russian autocrat to crush a monstrous evil like ISIS , as U.S. presidents did in working with anti - Communist dictators to win the Cold War .Midway through the debate , Trump cut loose with a sweeping indictment of mindless American interventionism in the Middle East : .We have done a tremendous disservice not only to the Middle East - we 've done a tremendous disservice to humanity .The people that have been killed , the people that have been wiped away - and for what ?It 's not like we had victory .It 's a mess .The Middle East is totally destabilized , a total and complete mess .I wish we had the 4 trillion dollars or 5 trillion dollars .I wish it were spent right here in the United States on schools , hospitals , roads , airports , and everything else that are all falling apart !If we do not want Syria in 2016 to become what Sarajevo became in 1914 , the powder keg that explodes into a world war , the War Party Republicans , who have learned nothing from the past , should be relegated to the past .It was the Cleveland Governors Conference of 1964 .Sen.

Brownshirts had been instrumental in securing Hitler 's rise to Chancellor of Germany on January 30 , 1933 .They had intimidated political opponents and organized mass rallies for the Nazi Party .But after Hitler reached the pinnacle of power , they became a liability .Ernst Rohem , their commander , urged Hitler to disband the regular German army , the Reichswehr , and replace it with his own legions as the nation 's defense force .Frightened by Rohem 's ambitions , the generals of the Reichswehr gave Hitler an ultimatum : Get rid of Rohem - or they would get rid of him .So Rohem died in a hail of SS bullets - as did several hundred of his longtime S.A. cronies .At least one member of the Republican Party is now learning that an apparently useful weapon can become a liability .Ever since Barack Obama became a Presidential candidate in 2008 , Republicans have accused him of being ineligible to hold office .Without a political scandal ( such as Bill Clinton 's affair with Monica Lewinsky ) to fasten on , the Republican Party opted for slander : Obama had been born in Kenya - and thus was not an American citizen .From this there could be only one conclusion : That he would be an illegitimate President , and should be removed from office if elected .And this smear campaign continued after he won the election .Right - wingers like real estate billionaire Donald Trump insisted that Obama had been born in Kenya , not Honolulu .During his first two years in office , Obama tried to ignore the charge .But polls repeatedly showed that large segments of the country believed it .Finally , even Obama 's closest advisers warned him : You must address this and put it to rest .So , on April 27 , 2011 , the President released the long - form of his Hawaii birth certificate .For the vast majority of Americans , this settled the issue .In 2012 , they re - elected Obama to a second , four - year term .Nevertheless , for many Right - wingers , even the release of Obama 's long - form birth certificate meant nothing .Joseph Arpaio , the Right - wing sheriff of Maricopa County , Arizona , claimed that his \" investigators \" were certain that Obama 's birth certificate was fraudulent .Responding to Arpaio 's claims , Joshua A.

Kennedy Jr.-who garnered plenty of media coverage .And , as it turns out , more 's the pity .Evidently , the anti - vaccine hysteria had some traction .Britain 's child vaccination rates are down to only 70 % in some regions , compared to more than 90 % in the mid-1990s .Note that 70 percent is well below the herd immunity threshold for the three diseases covered by the MMR vaccine .As such , measles cases skyrocketed .In 1998 , there were but 56 cases in all of England and Wales , while 2008 's figure was 1,370 .And , in 2006 , there was the first child measles fatality in more than ten years .While it would be very difficult to absolutely prove causality here , the implications are all too clear - ironically far clearer than the assertions in Wakefield 's paper .In a recent article in the New York Post ( 2/4/2010 ) entitled \" Who 'll Apologize to Dead Kids ? , \" Dr. Elizabeth Whelan - president of the American Council on Science and Health - weighed in on the matter : .Many of us in the scientific community recognized the \" study \" as junk when it appeared in 1998 .Even before we learned of then - unknown ethical failings by its lead author , we knew the study was based on a tiny population of only twelve children .More , it relied on a novel methodology that assumed some bizarre , previously unheard of , association between children 's autism and their manifestation of intestinal problems .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.0311"}

{"text": "She 's a freshmen .This is R+1 .All three of those are in play .To ensure victory this November , let 's make sure we get out and work hard to get these fine candidates elected .There was a time when states had rights and could count on the sovereignty of their own state constitutions and laws .But with the ever - growing overreach of our tyrannical federal government and liberal judges , that time is long past .In fact today , as fast as states pass laws to distance themselves from the insanity of unlawful federal mandates and regulations , higher court decisions reverse those efforts .So it does n't come as a huge shock that the 9 th Circuit justices issued an injunction against Arizona 's law pertaining to abortion drugs , but it does seem odd that the justices do n't feel obligated to follow federal FDA guidelines on pharmaceutical issues .I guess all those inconvenient rules are meant to be bent , twisted , and broken as often as necessary to further the socialist agenda .In 2012 , HB 2036 was passed by the Arizona State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Jan Brewer .But no sooner had the law taken effect than Planned Parenthood and the Tucson Women 's Center filed suit seeking an injunction against it on the grounds that it puts an \" undue burden \" on women seeking an abortion .However , U.S. District Court Judge David Bury refused to grant an injunction and rejected their argument , stating the law was put in place to protect women from \" dangerous and potentially deadly ' off - label ' uses \" of abortion drugs .But even before Judge Bury could rule on the legal issues , the 9 th Circuit Court of Appeals slammed down their collective heavy - handed gavel on Tuesday and granted a temporary stay .Apparently they have no respect for the lower court 's legal process or deliberation , because they stepped right in and took the case away from the District Court .The absurdity is that the portion of the law in question simply mandates that the abortifacient drug , RU-486 , Mifeprex , be used only per the guidelines of the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .Seems pretty straight forward to most physicians , but Planned Parenthood wants permission to do something no other doctor or hospital in the country can do .They want to operate outside government rules and collect your tax dollars while doing it .According to the Center for Arizona Policy , when the FDA approved RU-486 , it did so under Subpart H , a much more restrictive section of the FDA 's rules specifically set aside for potentially dangerous drugs .Out of almost 1800 new drug applications approved by the FDA between 1992 and 2011 , only 70 were approved under Subpart H. .The drug itself comes with precise prescribing information , labeled uses , and a lengthy warning list , and the licensing under Subpart H simply reinforced the manufacturer 's intentions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.93676"}
