{"text": "That is an issue in itself I believe worth exploring .Why is that ?I like this piece a lot , but I also think one reason national political candidates ( Palin aside ) pander to the rural is because they almost always come from urban areas .It 's assumed that they DO understand Chicago and New York , so they strain to show they ALSO understand other places and experiences .This article reminds me of an article I read that was a post - mortem of the 2004 election called \" the Urban Archipelago , Its the Cities Stupid .\" Basically , it argued the Democrats should focus on urban areas and forget rural issues and voters .The photo op of a political candidate in a small town , eating at a local restaurant , engaging rural America certainly embraces that sense of Americana that older Americans recall fondly and may still be nostalgic for in the deep recesses of their brains .I more or less agree with the notion that I think is being expressed here -- that political culture is responsible for or complicit in constructing an imaginary landscape -- \" landscapes of nostalgia \" -- which then become the terrain on which the political campaign is acted out .The question implied here though , by the two possiblities of responsiblity and complicity , is interesting .Surely this insight is n't one that has eluded the politicians -- surely they are aware that they are playing a game , campaigning in an imagined terrain .So there are two possibilites : either voters are being willfully deceived about the nature of modern america or they are willfully complicit in sustaining an illusion - because they WANT to participate in that illusion , or because something about that illusion is attractive to them .That is , the nostalgia is not just for another place , but for another time .And though that place and time may never have existed as we might imagine or will it to , it still has an extremely powerful hold on us .A recent article by Rod Dreher gets at this while talking about Mad Men : . \" In his 1995 book The Lost City , about Chicago in the 1950s , Alan Ehrenhalt warned against the way nostalgia and poetic memory tempts contemporaries to falsely idealize the past .Though Ehrenhalt chastised liberals who demonize the world of the Fifties as nothing but a nightmarish corseted burlesque of Joe McCarthy , Jim Crow , and Cardinal Spellman , he rapped conservatives for idealizing it as the last good decade before the Sixties ruined everything .We do n't want the 1950s back , \" Ehrenhalt wrote .What we want is to edit them .We want to keep the safe streets , the friendly grocers , and the milk and cookies , while blotting out the political bosses , the tyrannical headmasters , the inflexible rules , and the lectures on 100 percent Americanism .But there is no easy way to have an orderly world without somebody making the rules by which order is preserved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.632317"}

Fred Thompson of Tennessee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney both criticized the Confederate flag during the CNN / YouTube debate on Wednesday .The flag happens to be hoisted on the Statehouse grounds in the early primary state of South Carolina , where both candidates are leading in polls .The candidates were asked by YouTube user Leroy Brooks from Houston , Texas if \" this flag right here represents the symbol of racism , a symbol of political ideology , a symbol of Southern heritage - or , is it something completely different ? \"\" I know that everybody who hangs the flag up in their room like that is not racist , \" said Thompson , who has played up his southern roots while campaigning in South Carolina .\" I also know that for a great many Americans it 's a symbol of racism . \"Thompson added that , \" as far as a public place is concerned , I am glad that people have made the decision not to display it as a prominent flag , symbolic of something , at a state capitol .\" But the Confederate flag in South Carolina 's state capital is in a very public place - located on the Statehouse grounds along Gervais Street in Columbia , next to the Confederate Soldier Monument .It was moved there from atop the Statehouse dome in 2000 after an explosive national debate between supporters of the flag , who see it as a symbol of southern heritage , and opponents , who regard it as a symbol of slavery .After months of demonstrations , the state legislature moved the flag off the dome as a compromise .McCain was not asked about the flag during CNN / YouTube debate .On Nov. 6 , Thompson held a campaign event on the Statehouse grounds , just yards from the flag .Thompson said Wednesday that using the flag in the context of a memorial - as it is used in Columbia - is acceptable . \" As a part of a group of flags or something of that nature , you know , honoring various service people at different times in different parts of the country , I think that 's different , \" he said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.91953"}
