Tronsdal , Mogstad & Simonsen 's book has much history about the Rindal area , and Tronsdal briefly recounts some of the very intriguing stories .Rindal is a small Norwegian town 60 miles southwest of the city of Trondheim , and north of Trollheimen Mountain .The town is located where the Rinna River flows into the Surna River .Surrounding the town are many small farm villages called \" Gaards \" which have been divided and subdivided into smaller farms .Each farm village has a name and is home to a large extended family .Each farm village consists of one or more cluster of farmhouses , each also having its own name .From the 1860 's til 1910 , many Rindalings emigrated to America , usually to the mid - west , primarily to the following areas : - Norseville & Strum , Wisconsin - Underwood , Minnesota - Havanna , North Dakota - South - Central Canada .Frederick Olsen Romundstad was the first in the Romundstad extended family to emigrate to America .In 1829 , Frederick Olsen Romundstad was born at the Romundstad Oppistua farmhouse .His parents were Ola Olson Romundstad ( b.1794 ) and Sigrid Larsdatter Stompr \u00f8 d ( b.1794 ) from the neighboring farm village of Stompr \u00f8 d .Frederick was the 7th out of 8 children in the family , and the youngest of the 3 sons .In 1830 , when Frederick was 1 year old , his mother Sigrid died at age 36 .The next year , his father Ola Olson Romundstad remarried Gertrud Kroken , age 31 .In 1835 was the birth of the 8th and last child of this family , Sigrid Olsdatter Romundstad .Norway used the system of primogeniture , which meant that the oldest son inherited a farm from his father .The oldest brother in the family at the Romundstad Oppistua Farmhouse , was Ola Olson Romundstad ( b.1815 ) -- 14 years older than Frederick .In 1845 at age 30 Ola Olson married Eli Olsdatter Kvam , age 22 , and from 1847 - 1862 , they had seven children .In 1850 -- 5 years after marrying -- this oldest brother inherited the Romundstad Oppistua Farmhouse .As the family 's youngest brother , Frederick had little chance of ever coming into any other of the Romundstad Oppistua farmholdings .In addition , because the Rindal - area population was growing rapidly , there was little other available farmland anywhere in the area .So in 1853 , at age 24 , Frederick Olsen Romundstad left the Romundstad Farm Village and went to the Trondheim - area settlement of Strinda .For a more complete account of his life in the Trondheim area , see Olsen Family History .Eight years after Frederick Olsen Romundstad left his Romundstad Oppistua boyhood home , he & his family emigrated to America .They went first to areas of Wisconsin other than Norseville , where they ended up 8 years later , in 1869 ( see Olsen Family History ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.27713"}
