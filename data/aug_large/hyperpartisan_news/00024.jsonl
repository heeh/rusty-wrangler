{"text": "He finds that the difference in vote between the two measures is quite small - .9 % on average .Why is this important ?Because Trende is essentially extending my logic regarding the link between national and state - level voting which , in turn , determines the Electoral College results .I have argued that they tend to trend together .Trende tries to measure that more directly by estimating how \" biased \" the Electoral College , which is based on state - level votes , is in any given election .To do so Trende looks at the difference between the national vote margin and the popular vote margin he winning candidate receives in the state that gives him the 270 th vote .That difference , he says , tells us how much the winning candidate was rewarded ( or penalized ) by Electoral College .To follow Trende 's argument , let 's look at the current race and estimate the Electoral College bias , as of today .Romney currently leads in the national vote , according to the RCP composite average , by .7 % ( in an earlier version of this post I had that number wrong ) .If we add up all his strong and leaning states based on polling so far , he is likely to win at least 181 Electoral College votes .To pick up the additional electoral votes necessary to get to 270 , he has to win some combination of the 12 or so battleground states .Let us assume he wins the ones in which he leads as of today - Missouri , Florida , Colorado , and North Carolina .That gives him an additional 63 Electoral College votes - still 26 votes short of victory .If we look at the remaining tossup states , he runs closest to Obama in Virginia , where he is down by .4 % , New Hampshire at .7 % and in Ohio by 1.3 % .Virginia has 13 E.C. votes , New Hampshire has 4 , and Ohio 18 .Based on these biggest polling deficits , Ohio is the tipping point state - the one that if Romney wins he will go over 270 votes .Romney has to gain an additional 1.4 % nationally to overcome Obama 's lead in Ohio .Assuming a uniform vote swing , that gain would also give him victory in Virginia and New Hampshire as well and he would clinch the Electoral College .Put another way , if you compare Romney 's current lead in the RCP national poll - .7 % - with Obama 's lead in Ohio - 1.3 % , using Trende 's logic the Electoral College , as of today , is biased toward Obama by 2 % .That 's a relatively large bias compared to the average of .9 % that Trende finds for the previous 15 presidential elections .It means that to avoid an Electoral College / popular vote split , Romney must win the popular vote by more than 2 % ( again , assuming a uniform polling swing between the national and state vote ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.667297"}
{"text": "In looking at the key battleground states , Tomasky concludes that , given current polling , it is very unlikely that Romney will win enough of them to secure an Electoral College majority . \"In other words , Obama can lose the big Eastern four - Ohio , Virginia , North Carolina , and Florida : all of 'em ! -and still be reelected .And barring some huge cataclysm , he 's not losing all four of those states .If he wins even one - say Virginia , the smallest of the four - then Romney has to win Colorado , Iowa , and New Hampshire ; all possible , certainly , but all states where he has been behind , narrowly but consistently , for weeks or months .\" At first read , Tomasky 's logic seems persuasive .After all , Romney might squeak out a victory in one or two of the battleground states .But is it realistic to expect him to win the \" big four \" - \" all of 'em ! \"- and the additional battleground states he needs to claim victory ?Consider the state of the Electoral College map right now .Obama is likely starting from a baseline of some 179 electoral votes , compared to 131 for Romney .If we add the \" leaning \" states to each candidates ' column , Obama moves to 247 , while Romney is only at 191 .That leaves 100 electoral votes across eight states still in play .Let 's say that Tomasky is right and that Obama is not going to lose all of the eastern \" Big Four \" .Since Obama is up almost 5 points in state polling in Ohio , let 's assume Obama will win that , putting him at 265 electoral votes , only five short of the majority he needs to win .That would mean that of the remaining seven battleground states , Romney would need to win six : a seemingly daunting task .The problem with this type of analysis is that it implicitly treats the outcome in each state as an independent event .But they are not independent ; the factors that influence how well Romney does in Florida - say , voters ' perception of the national economy - will also affect his performance in the other battleground states .So if in the last weeks the undecideds break his way in one battleground state , they are likely to do so in all of them .And it wo n't take a \" cataclysm \" to push Romney over the top - he 's within 3 % in six of the eight battleground states based on the RealClearPolitics aggregate polling right now .This is not to say that local factors do n't matter at all - they do .And in a close election , they could be decisive .But national factors also come into play here , and that means it is not as improbable as you might think from reading Tomasky 's analysis that one candidate might end up sweeping almost all the closely contested races .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.714333"}
{"text": "Until the candidates or potential candidates for each political party are known , these odds will likely only cover whether the Democrats or the Republicans win control over the White House .These odds were available the day after the 2012 Presidential Election for the 2016 election ... we 've covered these odds on this page .And , just like any wager made with a sportsbook or online bookmaker , it will be handicapped however since there is only a winner and a loser , the wager is handicapped through payouts and the amount won with a single dollar wagered .Handicapped Electoral Vote Count - This type of betting should be familiar for anyone that knows about betting on sports .When the electoral vote count is handicapped , it is just like a spread on a football game , basketball games , etc .. Basically , the handicapped vote count will dictate the margin of electoral votes a candidate will need to win / lose by in order to win the wager .We mentioned Obama beat Romney by 126 electoral votes for which his handicapped line was 90.5 electoral votes .By winning by 91 or more votes , Obama won both the election as well as the wager for those who took the bet .It is unlikely to see this line until the weeks / days before the 2016 election .This predetermined amount will be different for each candidate based on his / her outlook for the upcoming election .Sometimes the over / under is handicapped through payouts to a single dollar wager because the difference in one state could potentially be as many as 55 electoral votes .Again , this wager usually is n't available until a week or two before the election .Odds To Win Popular Vote - This works just like the odds to win the election however winning the Electoral College and winning the popular vote are two completely different things mainly because you can win the popular vote but not the election .Still , odds for the popular vote are presented in the same format where either Candidate A or Candidate B wins .And without a spread / handicap , each side of the wager pays differently when a single dollar is wagered on one side versus the other .Look for the 2016 popular vote odds to become available within a month of the election date .Odds To Win A Particular Swing State - As we talked about previously , one state can make or break a campaign and therefore there is a lot of attention placed on particular states which could go either way ...Democrat or Republican .Each election is different but typically these wager revolve on bigger states which can actually impact the race significantly .Each state has different odds for Democrats or Republicans based on past elections , current polling , and registered voters in the state .Perhaps the best example of this wager was Florida in 2012 where Mitt Romney was better than a 2 to 1 favorite to win the state 's 29 electoral votes .Well , President Obama won Florida in 2012 thus winning a good chunk of money for anyone who bet on him to win the state because he was the underdog and a single dollar wager payed more than what was bet plus the original amount risked .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.760185"}
{"text": "\" If the election were held tomorrow , it would n't just be a possibility , it would be actual , \" added William A. Galston , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , who also served as a policy adviser to President Bill Clinton .Explore the 2012 electoral map and view historical results and demographics .No incumbent president seeking a second term has ever won the electoral college and lost the popular vote .( Though Clinton got more votes than his first race and won in the electoral college , he was re - elected in 1996 without winning a majority in a three - way race against Republican Bob Dole and independent Ross Perot . )A win in the electoral college that is not accompanied by one in the popular vote casts a shadow over the president and his ability to govern .If Obama is reelected that way , \" the Republican base will be screaming that Romney should be president , and Obama does n't represent the country , \" McKinnon predicted .\" It 's going to encourage more hyperpartisanship .\"Veterans of the Bush White House understand that problem well .Bush was never able to shake the accusations of some Democrats that he had \" stolen \" the 2000 election in a recount of Florida votes that required a U.S. Supreme Court decision to determine the winner .Then - Vice President Al Gore had won the popular vote that year by 500,000 votes .\" A close election is a polarizing event , and a discrepancy between the popular outcome and the electoral vote only adds to the polarization , \" said Karen Hughes , who served as a counselor to Bush .\" It rubs a raw nerve even rawer . \"And that kind of split decision may well happen more often in the future , if the nation 's political system remains both deeply and closely divided .The electoral college is an artifact of an era when the lack of organized political parties and the difficulties of travel and communication prevented candidates from waging a national campaign .Given those impediments , the Founding Fathers were leery of a direct popular vote as a means of gauging the popular will .But they also did not want to give Congress the power to select a president .So they set up a process by which each state would be allocated a number of electors , equal to the total of its House members and senators .If that system yet again produces a president who does not also win the popular vote , it will raise new questions about whether the electoral college should be abolished - something that would require a constitutional amendment .For now , however , both campaigns are so fixated on winning the battleground states that they are not giving much thought to the prospect of an electoral college victory that is not accompanied by a popular - vote mandate .Obama 's strategists , for instance , say they have not conducted a single national poll and have had no conversations about how to deal with the political fallout from a split decision .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.46246"}

{"text": "Menu .An Electoral Landslide For Obama ?Michael Tomasky wrote a provocative online piece yesterday in the Daily Beast in which he speculated that Obama may , in fact , be on the verge of winning an electoral landslide .the paths to 270 are few . \"In looking at the key battleground states , Tomasky concludes that , given current polling , it is very unlikely that Romney will win enough of them to secure an Electoral College majority . \"In other words , Obama can lose the big Eastern four - Ohio , Virginia , North Carolina , and Florida : all of 'em ! -and still be reelected .And barring some huge cataclysm , he 's not losing all four of those states .If he wins even one - say Virginia , the smallest of the four - then Romney has to win Colorado , Iowa , and New Hampshire ; all possible , certainly , but all states where he has been behind , narrowly but consistently , for weeks or months .\" At first read , Tomasky 's logic seems persuasive .After all , Romney might squeak out a victory in one or two of the battleground states .But is it realistic to expect him to win the \" big four \" - \" all of 'em ! \"- and the additional battleground states he needs to claim victory ?Consider the state of the Electoral College map right now .Obama is likely starting from a baseline of some 179 electoral votes , compared to 131 for Romney .If we add the \" leaning \" states to each candidates ' column , Obama moves to 247 , while Romney is only at 191 .That leaves 100 electoral votes across eight states still in play .Let 's say that Tomasky is right and that Obama is not going to lose all of the eastern \" Big Four \" .Since Obama is up almost 5 points in state polling in Ohio , let 's assume Obama will win that , putting him at 265 electoral votes , only five short of the majority he needs to win .That would mean that of the remaining seven battleground states , Romney would need to win six : a seemingly daunting task .The problem with this type of analysis is that it implicitly treats the outcome in each state as an independent event .But they are not independent ; the factors that influence how well Romney does in Florida - say , voters ' perception of the national economy - will also affect his performance in the other battleground states .So if in the last weeks the undecideds break his way in one battleground state , they are likely to do so in all of them .And it wo n't take a \" cataclysm \" to push Romney over the top - he 's within 3 % in six of the eight battleground states based on the RealClearPolitics aggregate polling right now .This is not to say that local factors do n't matter at all - they do .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.11776"}

{"text": "Now , there is a somewhat competing model as many have noted in comments to previous articles of this nature .Specifically , many point out the Dick Morris observation that the undecided voters generally break towards the challenger over the incumbent in the election booth .When 75 % of undecided voters swing towards Romney come election day , Romney wins the election with 311 electoral votes to Obama 's 227 .This model would deliver Nevada , Colorado , Iowa , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New Hampshire to Romney .I did not include the southern states or Missouri since my \" trend \" model also predicts Romney victories there .But , a totally different electoral scenario develops when the number is dropped to 67 % of undecided voters pulling the lever for Romney .In that case , the outcome is Obama with 322 electoral votes to Romney 's 216 .In this scenario , Obama would not only keep Nevada , Colorado , Ohio and Pennsylvania , but he would also win Florida and Virginia .Romney would keep both Iowa and New Hampshire .Neither of those states are particularly rich in electoral votes , but Obama 's states in this scenario are the jewels of the battleground states and an exclamation point on his reelection .The final scenario I looked at was what if the undecided voters broke for the challenger against an incumbent based on the most recent example in 2004 when John Kerry took on George W. Bush .According to CNN exit poll data , undecided voters who voted for Kerry , the challenger , did so at a rate of about 54 % .That is considerably below the 75 % postulated by Morris .In that case , the electoral outcome would come out as my original \" trend analysis \" predicts- Obama winning 290 - 248 .Obviously , this is based on polling data three months out from the general election and yes , that is the only \" poll \" that counts .It may very well turn out , although not likely , that all undecided voters will vote for Romney .In that case , then it would spell an unmitigated electoral disaster and repudiation of Barack Obama .Well , we can dream .Of course , we have not had any conventions yet nor have we had any debates .We do not even know who Mitt Romney 's running mate is yet .So , a lot can change between now and any point in the future .And speaking of Romney 's running mate , it can not be overemphasized that his selection will not necessarily be the deciding factor with respect to any battleground state .Numerous studies have proven that the selection of a Vice Presidential running mate has no effect on swinging that selection 's home state into their camp .Hence , choosing a Rob Portman will likely have no effect on delivering Ohio to Romney , nor will McDonnell assure a victory in Virginia or Rubio a victory in Florida .That is why I am steadfast in my belief that Romney will look beyond that consideration and select Senator John Thune of South Dakota .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.28619"}
