{"text": "I 'm curious now and wanting to know what Palin 's church teaches , because it sure is n't \" Love thy Neighbor As thyself .\" The pastor that prayed at one of their rallies today , prayer was even out of line .You do n't pray curses or for bad things to happen to people .You pray for good things to happen and pray blessings into their life , and that includes your enemies .You bless those that curse you , do good to those who despitefully misuse you .Palin is the modern day Jezebel , she enjoys giving hate speeches .If things did n't go Jezebel 's way , she was vindictative and dangerous .Jezebel was extremely religious too , but she worshipped the god of hate , which was her downfall .Palin is pure evil .McCain is the modern day King Saul , he was jealous of David and tried to have him killed .The people favored David more than they did King Saul and that made Saul so jealous he wanted David dead .I 'm not sure why O should be expected to say anything about it at all ?It 's so racist for McCain to request that and really reduces the man that Lewis is into just a neighborhood guy that O needs to stifle .And no one in the media is jumping on that , I have n't seen it .He did n't tell Obama to request a retraction of anything any other private citizen has said about the campaign .He 's basically saying , \" Keep your people in line Barack .\" Idiots , god .This is the hardest thing for the old and creaky boomer generation to realize : that not all black people are the same person .I 'm so glad Palin was booed today , but I feel really sorry for those kids of hers .Rep. John Lewis merely told the truth and the Republican machine behind the Old Coot and McCandy ca n't handle the truth .There 's been much chatter the past 48 hours about the Old Coot \" tamping down the character assassination rhetoric \" about Obama .Do n't anyone buy it for a hot San Francisco minute .As recently as yesterday afternoon at 4:00PM EST , a McCain surrogate was on MSNBC spinning the William Ayers shit to David Shuster .To his credit , Shuster gave the surrogate three chances to back away from it but , the surrogate was having none of it .Back to Rep. John Lewis .Did n't the Old Coot once say Lewis is \" one of the wisest men I know ? \" Could n't agree more with you about the Republicans ' desparation tactics , as well as about Lewis .Lewis was absolutely right to call out the Republicans and their Deputy Cheerleader , who have obviously now apparently decided to Go Neg .At least as of now , the polls show it 's not working ; in fact , it seems to be backfiring on them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "122.15424"}

Lewis is pretty consistent throughout his writings , and Great Divorce is by no means an aberrational view of his .He describes the very same thing in \" Problem of Pain , \" and thus , this understanding of hell is not at all limited to the genre of the fantastic .In his introduction to his Anthology of George MacDonald , he explicitly states that he intended to \" spread MacDonald 's theology , \" and to \" release a debt of gratitude to MacDonald . \"Read the thesis again -- I think it is brilliant , although he does n't quite connect Lewis 's vision to Orthodoxy which can easily be done .Hi Gavvy , I 'll have to check out all of this more thoroughly , and look at the thesis again , though I 'm not sure when I will get to it .You mean Christ the Savior Church ?Nope , that was given to us just a few years ago -- previously it was a \" Catholic Apostolic \" congregation , which I understand is kind of Anglican but they believed in celibacy for everybody .It definitely has a more Anglicanish feel , though we 're in the process of renovating it , adding a more permanent iconostasis and so on .-- Fr Lev 22:34 , December 7 , 2008 ( UTC )", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "131.5195"}
