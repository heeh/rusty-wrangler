{"text": "Steve sees voting Republican as a covert exercise in identity politics for white men .But since it is covert and since liberals still set the mainstream rules for what demands and complaints are morally legitimate white men fail to effectively advance their own interests explicitly enough to get the Republican Party to translate those demands into policy .There 's nothing unnatural about the people who keep the country running wanting to have a large say in running the country .The problem , though , is that white male identity politics is the self - love that dares not speak its name .So , many Republican white men studiously avoid endorsing policies that would actually help white male Republicans , such as immigration restrictions .They are too intimidated by fears of being accused of bias in favor of themselves .Of course , every other group in America is free to be flagrantly biased in favor of its own members ' welfare , but white males are n't allowed that freedom .As a tragic result white males have , by voting Republican inadvertently empowered the neoconservatives to pursue a foreign policy strategy that is harmful to US interests .Some neocons , on their more honest moments , are open about their ideological approach to politics ( really , read to the end of this article and again look for the mention of the word \" ideological \" ) .So the first generation neocons might have been ex - Trotskyites but while they changed to a different abstract model of politics too many kept an unempirical theoretical approach to reasoning about the human condition .Traditional conservatism is in a sense the antithesis of an ideology because conservatives have a distrust for highly systematized political philosophies and for the idea that humans can create utopias .I think the neocons , not being real conservatives , are motivated in foreign policy by a mixture of interest in Israel and their misguided desire to spread their own form of utopian democratic liberalism .The Democrats probably ca n't adjust their message to once again attract white males because the Democratic Party is too intent on attracting lots of other identity groups such as blacks , Hispanics , career women , welfare recipients , gays , and others .The Dems are going to continue to be willing to discriminate against and transfer assets away from white males to serve these other groups - all the while labelling large numberes of white males violent , racist , and assorted other derogatory terms .As a consequence the battle over the Republican Party is going to remain the most important political battle in America for a while longer - at least until demographic patterns shift power more permanently to the Democrats and the US becomes more like Latin America .If white males become angry enough to reject left - liberal definitions of what is moral and what is acceptable then we could stop invading other countries and even implement a much more restrictive immigration policy .But do n't expect any help to come from a serious attempt by the Democrats to compete for the white male vote .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.18179"}
{"text": "No way .Putin and Khamenie are with Assad to the end .Indeed , the Russian military has joined forces with Iranian troops , Hezbollah fighters and Shia militiamen from Iraq to keep Assad in power and destroy the US coalition backed anti - regime rebels .Since that has happened the US has ended all manned ( not unmanned drone ) flights over Syria fearing that Russia might shoot down one of our planes .There is no world leader Obama fears more than Putin and he 's not going to chance a war with him , or look more pathetic than he is from backing down .It seems that Obama and Kerry are hoping against hope that Putin will co\u00f6perate with them on Assad like he did on the Iran nuke deal .But that deal with its $ 150 billion windfall benefited the Russians as Iran is using those funds to buy missile defense systems , helicopters , planes and god knows what else from them .The question is what 's in it for Putin if he agrees ( unlikley though it be ) to free and fair democratic elections in Syria ?What could the great blundering appeaser offer Putin to get him on board as a real peace partner in transitioning Syria to a post - Assad democratic era ?The only possibility as I see it is Obama proposing to Putin the lifting of all punishing sanctions for Crimea and Ukraine .Indeed , after what a desperate failing Obama gave away to Iran for them to sign the nuke agreement it 's not inconceivable that he 'd do something similar for Russia before leaving office .Of course , if such a deal were to be struck ( is Putin cleverly angling for it ? ) it would legitimize Russia 's annexation of Crimea and elevate even higher Putin 's growing prestige while wetting his appetite for more land grabs .Embarrassing as this might be for Obama ( but politically good for Hillary and the Dems ) he might think it 's a better .alternative then suffering the condemnation of history for his inaction on Syria while hundreds and thousands died and fled the country in terror .The other alternative for the US and Russia to continue clashing over Syria and ISIS with war breaking out after Obama leaves office .But gas prices have gone south ending the administration 's stupid Europeanizing plans .Why are these three clowns celebrating the Paris Climate Accord as a victory ?Just as the Iran nuke deal does n't stop the mullahs from getting the bomb ( a bad thing ) , nor does this accord stop the massive use of cheap fossil fuels ( a good thing ) .Indeed , Obama , Kerry , Gore and the warmunist Left must be eating their hearts out as the last thing they wanted to see were substantially lower , collapsing oil prices and cheaper gas for motorists at the pump .Why ?Because it poses a challenge for the transition to decarbonized ( zero carbon ) green energy economies as falling gas prices create a huge incentive to use more fossil fuels over cleaner but costlier alternatives while increasing ( harmless ) CO2 emissions globally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.24713"}

{"text": "BridgeGate ' in Perspective .The mainstream media ( MSM ) have been in a feeding frenzy over Chris Christie and \" Bridgegate .\" The three television networks , for example , devoted 17 times the number of stories about \" Bridgegate \" in one day that they gave to the Obama Administration 's \" IRSgate \" scandal in six months .The assault on Christie appears to have metastasized .The newest revelation , provided by the Democrat mayor of Hoboken , NJ , alleges that the Christie Administration held up funds to help her city recover from Hurricane Sandy because it had not moved quickly enough on a project favored by the governor .Two things should be noted immediately .First , I 'm not a Christie supporter .Second , \" Bridgegate , \" and Hoboken 's mayor 's accusations -- if true -- reveal stupidity ( and probably arrogance ) in Christie 's Administration .Those statements should be juxtaposed to two observations .First , as Finley Peter Dunne 's Mr. Dooley said , \" politics ai n't beanbag .\" It 's a body - contact sport , with rough-'n - ready tactics in which people ( and causes ) get hurt .( Growing up in central Illinois , I learned very early how Chicago politics works .I also observed a cardinal principle of the Kennedy clan 's politics : \" do n't get mad , get even . \" ) Second , if \" Bridgegate \" and the Hoboken contretemps were instances of political retribution , they follow a very long line of cases in which politicos used government to injure political opponents ( or at least condoned subordinates who did it ) .We need , in short , to put the Christie Administration 's conduct into historical perspective .Let us focus on U.S. presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt .Although many historians hail FDR as the savior of American democracy , Burton Folsom , Jr . wrote that he regularly sought to use the IRS to target political opponents .Add FDR 's infamous Executive Order 9066 shipping thousands of Japanese Americans to internment camps , and you only scratch the surface of the lawlessness that occurred during Roosevelt 's presidency .After John F. Kennedy was assassinated , his widow , assisted by Theodore H. White , manufactured the \" Camelot Legend \" that raised the martyred president to the status of a liberal icon .Many people have forgotten JFK 's use of the FBI to investigate businessman Roger Blough who bucked the president 's economic policies , and to tape Martin Luther King 's extra - marital sexual escapades .( One could mention other instances of abuse of power during Kennedy 's presidency , but these will do . )Lyndon B.

Rick Snyder ( R ) apologized publicly for the water crisis in Flint , conceded that he let the community down , and vowed to try to put things right .And to that end , the Republican governor released 274 pages of emails yesterday , which Snyder says represents all of the Flint - related correspondence he had in 2014 and 2015 .This may not be adequate .As the governor 's office has already acknowledged , the decision to switch Flint 's water source away from Detroit , for example , was made in June 2013 .In other words , as Rachel noted on last night 's show , the key decisions were made before the time period reflected in Snyder 's emails .When The Rachel Maddow Show asked the governor 's office whether the Flint - related emails from 2013 would also be publicly released , Snyder aides were non - committal .Meanwhile , the materials that have been released are serious enough that Snyder may owe the public another apology or two .The New York Times reported this morning : .A top aide to Michigan 's governor referred to people raising questions about the quality of Flint 's water as an \" anti - everything group .\" Other critics were accused of turning complaints about water into a \" political football . \"And worrisome findings about lead by a concerned pediatrician were dismissed as \" data , \" in quotes .[ ... ] .[ T]he documents provide a glimpse of state leaders who were at times dismissive of the concerns of residents , seemed eager to place responsibility with local government and , even as the scientific testing was hinting at a larger problem , were reluctant to acknowledge it .In one particularly damning email from late September 2015 , the governor 's then - chief of staff said he could n't \" figure out why the state is responsible \" for the Flint crisis .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.234985"}
{"text": "It is the modern - day equivalent of Bella Abzug , the New York feminist , and James Eastland , the Mississippi segregationist , attending Democratic conventions together in the 1960 's .It is too ridiculous to last , and it wo n't .The potential for schism in the unwieldy Republican ranks is nothing new ; it goes back to the debate between libertarians and Christian moralists that played out in the National Review in the 1950 's .In 1980 , Ronald Reagan won a presidential election as head of a movement that improbably fused together disciples of Jerry Falwell and disciples of Milton Friedman .But all the factions could agree on the need for a tough stand against Communism , no matter what their differences might be over abortion or federal spending .Ehrenhalt thinks the conflicts of interests between the factions in the Republican coaltion are becoming more apparent to the various factions .This makes sense to me intuitively .Take abortion for example .25 years ago libertarians and moderate Republicans who were not opposed to abortion did n't have to worry that a President like Reagan might nominate justices to the US Supreme Court who would overturn Roe v. Wade .The size of the shift needed on the Supreme Court was too large to happen in a single President 's term of office .But we are fast approaching the point where the Supreme Court will really overturn Roe v. Wade and that 'll make differences on this issue harder to ignore .Similarly , the factions of the Republican coalition who believe in lower taxes and less spending have got to be thinking that when it comes to spending what is the point of even bothering to vote for Republicans rather than Democrats ?But I see a much bigger threat to the Republican coalition : More states are going to fall into the Donkey column due to immigration .For example , the influx of Hispanics into Georgia and North Carolina might knock both states of the fairly reliable Republican column in Presidential elections .The Republican Party has already declined into long term minority status in California .The fate of the Republican Party in Californa presages the fate of the Republican Party elsewhere .One of the curious trends in American politics is a decline in the extent to which the parties are defined by class and an increase in racial identity determining party affiliation .Lower class whites increasingly have voted Republican and this has compensated for the growing number of other races voting for the Democrats .But higher income liberals who do not identify with capital owners vote for the Democrats in spite of their income levels .Is this pattern stable ?Or will the parties eventually return to representing class interests ?Or will the decline of whites as a percentage of the total US population drive even more whites into the Republican Party ?Right now the Republicans are hurting in the eyes of the public because of the Bush Administrations ' mistakes and policies .Will the discrediting of Bush lead to a paleocon resurgence in the Republican Party ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.24074"}

{"text": "Pointing to a 2015 study from Penn State researchers , the report notes that slugs are n't affected by neonics , so they can gobble neonic - treated soy sprouts at will , accumulating the chemical .But when insects called the ground beetle - which has a taste for slugs but not soybean plants - eat the neonic - containing slugs , they tend to die .So slugs transfer the poison from the crops to their natural predator , the ground beetle , and throw the predator balance out of whack , allowing slugs to proliferate .As a result , the Penn State researchers found , neonic seed treatments actually reduce yields in slug - infested fields .Of course , the most celebrated \" non - target \" insect potentially affected by neonics is the honeybee .As I reported last week , the EPA recently released an assessment finding that one particular neonic that 's widely used on soybean seeds , imidacloprid , likely harms individual bees and whole bee colonies at levels commonly found in farm fields .That 's because plants from neonic - treated seeds do n't just carry the poison in their leaves and stalks ; they also deliver it in bee - attracting nectar and pollen .While cotton is the imidacloprid - treated crop most likely to hit bees hard , soybeans , too , may pose a threat , the EPA found .The agency could n't say for sure , because data on how much of the pesticide shows up in soybeans ' pollen and nectar are \" unavailable , \" both from Bayer and from independent researchers .That information gap may be cold comfort for beekeepers , but the agrichemical industry will no doubt seize upon it to argue that its blockbuster chemical is harmless to bees .The rest of us can savor the bitter irony that this widely used pesticide may be more effective at slaying beneficial pollinators than it is at halting crop - chomping pests .A few days ago Marian went out to buy some new cat toys because , you know , a couple dozen clearly was n't enough .You can see her haul below , all with nice , fresh tails .Once the tails come off - which does n't take long - they're no fun anymore .But you ca n't please everyone .Hilbert looks like he 's saying \" What ?That 's all ?I jumped all the way onto the counter just for this ? \"In other cat news , my sister points us to this YouTube video of a cat invading a Liverpool - Spurs soccer match .It 's three years old , but who 's counting ?It is , of course , normal for Republicans to claim that Democrats have screwed everything up and vice versa .That 's what political parties do .But as I ( and many others ) have noted before , it 's remarkable just how apocalyptic Republicans are this year .Listening to the GOP debate last night , you might have barely avoided slitting your own throat in despair over the destruction of a once - great country that we 've all witnessed over the past seven years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.098145"}

{"text": "It may be that the best thing Hitler could have done for the Third Reich would have been to retire from the day to day running of the country and appoint a successor .The problem is that Fuehrers really ca n't retire , and Hitler was not willing to be known to history as the predecessor to the man who created the thousand year Reich .He did not want to play the role of Phillip the Macedonian to another man 's Alexander the Great .It is a little strange that Hitler 's increasingly obvious lapses in judgment towards the end of the war did not lead to some sort of coup .There were attempts to assassinate the Fuhrer , most notably the plot by Army officers led by Claus von Stauffenberg , but no attempts to seize power by the members of Hitler 's inner circle who had direct knowledge of his increasing inability to lead the Third Reich .They schemed among themselves for Hitler 's favor right up to the end , but none of them ever seem to have seriously considered replacing him .Perhaps they realized that they were not strong personalities in themselves and their fates were inextricably tied to Hitler 's .Whatever the precise nature of Hitler 's illness , I think we can all be grateful that Hitler did suffer from ill health that made him more impatient and reckless .A healthier Hitler might have been a more rational Hitler better able to lead his nation in war and peace and perhaps more likely to succeed in his goals .It maybe that Hitler 's illness is the major reason Nazi Germany is not the leading world power to this day .Recently Stephen Green of Vodkapundit wrote a post titled President Nero referring to President Obama 's seeming cluelessness on the state of the world under his leadership , particularly the president 's prioritizing action on climate change as post Cold War order is breaking up into chaos .Obama is fiddling while the Middle East burns .There is much worth reading here yet I think that Stephen Green is being more than a little unfair to Nero .Nero did not , after all , really play the fiddle , or his lyre as the violin had not yet been invented , while Rome burned down .In fact , Nero did everything that could be expected of an emperor in that disaster .Nero was not a particularly good emperor , to be sure , yet his reign was not a complete disaster , especially early on while his advisors Seneca and Burrus still lived .Despite the short civil war after his death and the rebellion in Judea , the Roman Empire was still strong and whole at the end of Nero 's reign .In fact , the next century was to prove to be the height of the Pax Romana under the Flavian Dynasty and the Five Good Emperors .Perhaps a better fit for President Obama might be a later emperor , Honorius who was emperor when the Visigoths sacked Rome in AD 410 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.53192"}

Birney of the anti - slavery Liberty party got 62,103 votes or 2.3 % of the popular vote , enough to have made a difference in some Northern states .In the Electoral College , Polk got 170 electoral votes , winning states both in the North and South .Manifest Destiny proved to be a popular platform .Clay won 105 Electoral Votes , winning his home state , Kentucky , Tennessee , Ohio , and a few Eastern states , including New Jersey , North Carolina and Massachusetts .The United States formally annexed Texas in March 1845 , just before Polk took office .As expected , The Mexican War broke out the following year .As for Polk , he served one term , during which he worked very hard , to the point of exhaustion .He declined to run for a second term and died within three months of the end of his administration . \"Mr. Carson clearly does not understand or care about the Constitution , which states that ' no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office , ' \" said CAIR national executive director Nihad Awad .\" We call on our nation 's political leaders - across the political spectrum - to repudiate these unconstitutional and un - American statements and for Mr. Carson to withdraw from the presidential race .\" I can understand if Nihad Awad is more familiar with the details of Sharia law than the US constitution , but the provision barring any religious test does not apply to the voters .They can vote for , or against , a candidate for any office for any reason at all , including not liking the candidate 's religious beliefs .The constitution forbids the federal or state governments from imposing a religious test or qualification to bar candidates from running .For example , in the presidential elections of 1928 and 1960 the Catholics Al Smith and John F. Kennedy ran for the presidency .Many non - Catholic voters did not believe that a Catholic should serve as president and voted for their opponents .That was their decision to make .There was no religious test or qualification to bar either man from running .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.93408"}

{"text": "( Or before then due to an expanded FBI investigation into her emails that could end her White House run ? )Of course I have no way of knowing .But I have discovered several interesting coincidences which I think will fascinate you as much as they fascinate me perhaps indicating that Hillary will not be the next US president .This is what I 've found .On October 26 , 2005 when my mother died Hillary turned 58 years old .Now 58 is a factor of the number 1972 ( 34x ) .You will recall that 1972 was the election year where Democrat George McGovern lost to incumbent Richard Nixon in a crushing 49 state landslide defeat .You might also recall that Bill and Hillary were active in that campaign working as volunteers for the McGovern organization in Texas .Now here is where it gets profound : when McGovern died on October 21 , 2012 ( between Benghazi and Election Day ) he was laid to rest five days later on Hillary 's 65th birthday .Moreover , George McGovern ( born July 19 , 1922 ) was 90 years old when he died .90 seems significant in that it 's a multiple of 45 ( 2x ) the number of the next president .Indeed , McGovern dying when he did ( during a presidential campaign ) , at the age that he was and put to rest on the meaningful day when that was done does n't seem very auspicious for Hillary 's 2016 fortunes .But we shall see .BTW , when 13 Hours ended and the credits were rolling an audience member with his fist raised high shouted out the following : .FUCK OBAMA !FUCK HILLARY !Many in the audience ( I included ) applauded in appreciation of this man 's patriotic indignation with some shouting \" RIGHT ON ! \"and \" GIVE EM ' HELL !\" It was a great way to end the evening .Obama struggling to keep up his faith against the reality of a disastrous presidency .That 's how I felt as Obama 's impassioned overlong speech boringly unfolded .Indeed , the speech , as Rush Limbaugh said , \" was n't so much the State of the Union as it was the State of Obama .It 's as though he were saying that he 's psychologically ready for any and all eventualities .That he has a secret power to elevate his soul above it all ( a psychic trick he learned from Rev. Wright , see ) .No matter how bad the tragic events or market downturns that may occur between now and the end of his term Obama will leave office with his utopian faith and leftist mindset perfectly in tact because he never learns .And Sancho Panzas like me ( so he believes ) will in time come to see that he was right .POSTSCRIPT .OBAMA 'S SPEECH AND HIS 9 - 10 MENTALITY .Last night our weak - on - terror president ( whose policies midwifed ISIS ) with the massive 9 - 10 mentality ( \" we exaggerate the terrorist threat \" ) ominously started his speech at 9:10 pm and finished 59 minutes later at 10:09 pm ( encoded with the number 910 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.76472"}
{"text": "Themes explored in feminism include discrimination , stereotyping , objectification ( especially sexual objectification ) , oppression , and patriarchy .Contents .Psychoanalytic feminism is based on Freud and his psychoanalytic theories .It maintains that gender is not biological but is based on the psycho - sexual development of the individual .Psychoanalytical feminists believe that gender inequality comes from early childhood experiences , which lead men to believe themselves to be masculine , and women to believe themselves feminine .It is further maintained that gender leads to a social system that is dominated by males , which in turn influences the individual psycho - sexual development .As a solution it was suggested to avoid the gender - specific structurization of the society by male - female coeducation .This section is a stub .You can help by adding to it .This section is a stub .You can help by adding to it .A radical feminist would argue that the only way to rid womankind from male domination is to segregate men and women into two different communities .Contrary to socialist feminists , radicals believe that simply abolishing the current hegemonic state will not rid ' the fairer sex ' from oppresion ; it is only with the partition of men from women that true equality can exist between the sexes .Critics may point out that seperating men from women would surely prevent the human race from producing children , and as such , would result in the end of human existence .However , a radical would suggest that with the advances made in biological science over recent decades , an all - female population would be able to sustain its numbers through insemination methods such as IVF .Any male offspring produced would simply be transported to the male community and raised there .This utopian vision is often looked negatively upon by others for being unrealistic in its expectations .Of all the factions that exist within the feminst ideology , Radical feminism remains the smallest and least influential .This section is a stub .You can help by adding to it .There exists a common ground between socialist and radical feminists in so far as both factions believe that only with the abolition of the current hegemonic state , can true equality exist between men and women .Unlike radicals however , Socialist feminists do believe that men can coexist with women in this post - capitalist vision of the future .This is because socialists suspect the capitalist system to be the root cause of female oppression , rather than males themselves .A belief amongst socialists of any kind is that a population can be nutured into a state of equality , and as such , would have no need to separate men from women .With the abolition of the class structure , a socialist may argue , comes the erosion of male domination within society .Modern feminist theory has been extensively criticized as being predominantly , but not exclusively , associated with western middle class academia .Not only that , but feminism has been criticized as being far too gender - centric , and ignores many of the other , far more important problems of Racism and social inequality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.19095"}

{"text": "Although he had been a Whig as William Henry Harrison 's running mate in the previous election , Tyler had been a Democrat before breaking with Andrew Jackson back in the 1830 's .Tyler had never really been a strict party man and while president he had managed to offend the leaders of both political parties .Tyler did make some effort towards building a third party of his supporters , but nothing came of it and he eventually agreed to drop out in favor of the Democratic nominee .The Whigs met in Baltimore on May 1 and nominated their long time party leader and 1824 presidential candidate Henry Clay .Clay had initially opposed the annexation of Texas as he believed that any such action without an agreement with Mexico would surely provoke a war between the United States and Mexico .Clay also understood that the annexation of Texas would only increase the sectional tensions between the North and South and might well split the Whig Part and the nation .This stand was not particularly popular in the South and Clay almost immediately began to backtrack , stating that he would support the annexation of Texas , even in the absence of an agreement with Mexico provided both North and South supported it .Then , he changed his mind again , and finally stopped talking about annexation altogether , campaigning on domestic issues .It did n't work .For Clay 's running mate , the Whigs nominated Theodore Frelinghuysen , a Senator from New Jersey .The Whigs felt that the devout , Northern Frelinghuysen would provide a nice balance with Henry Clay , the Kentuckian who had become notorious for his drinking , gambling , and dueling .Frelinghuysen was perhaps too devout as his Evangelical Christian faith led him to oppose slavery , he wanted to send them all back to Africa , and Indian removal .Neither position was apt to win him support in the South and West .Frelinghuysen also happened to believe that Catholics should be encouraged to convert to Protestantism , which cost the ticket votes among the small but growing Catholic population in the North .Martin Van Buren was , at first , the prospective nominee of the Democrats , who met at the Odd Fellows Hall in Baltimore late in May.Van Buren lost his support because of his opposition to the annexation of Texas .There was no other front runner for the Democratic nomination until the little known James Knox Polk was introduced on the eighth ballot .Polk had been Speaker of the House from 1835 - 1839 and governor of Tennessee from 1839 - 1841 .He had acquired a reputation for being quietly competent and had made few enemies and this along with his strong support of the annexation of Texas caused Polk to be nominated on the ninth ballot .The Democrats , at first , had wanted Silas Wright from New York as Polk 's running mate , but Wright was a supporter of Van Buren 's and declined the honor .Instead , the Democrats nominated Senator George M.

{"text": "The Roman Empire had been first divided into Western and Eastern halves by the Emperor Diocletian about a century earlier .After ending the period of incessant civil wars and foreign invasions that had nearly destroyed the Empire , Diocletian realized that one man was unable to meet the challenges of ruling the entire empire and so had divided it .The last emperor to rule over the whole Roman Empire was Honorius 's father Theodosius the Great .After his death in 395 , the empire was divided for the last time between his two sons Arcadius and Honorius .Arcadius was the elder brother and so inherited the more desirable Eastern Empire where he ruled from Constantinople , while Honorius became the Western Emperor .Both emperors were minors when they acceded to their thrones and neither ever really showed much talent for ruling but the wealthier and more urbanized Eastern Empire proved to be better able to weather Arcadius 's inept rule .The West was not so fortunate and Honorius 's reign was a disaster from beginning to end with continuing invasions by the barbarian Germans and continual civil war by usurpers .At the beginning of Honorius 's reign the true ruler of the West was his guardian , Stilicho a Roman general of mixed Roman and German descent who had been related by marriage to Theodosius .Stilicho was perhaps the last Roman ruler who could have saved the Western Empire from destruction .He had some success in holding the Empire together but proved unable to prevent the invasion of Gaul by the Germans in 406 and the subsequent abandonment of Britannia .This proved to be not a very good idea , since by then , the Roman army was largely made up of Germans , large numbers of Honorius 's soldiers simply deserted leaving Italy defenseless against the invading Visigoths under their king Alaric .The Visigoths did not intend to capture Rome or conquer the Roman Empire .Indeed , they did not believe such a thing was possible .They , along with their kinsmen the Ostrogoths had fled into Roman territory to escape the Huns .Alaric wanted to negotiate with the Roman government for a homeland to establish an independent Visigothic kingdom allied to Rome .Alaric decided to threaten the city of Rome to compel the Roman government to negotiate in good faith .Honorius and his court were not greatly concerned however because it had been a long time since Rome was actually the capital of any part of the Roman Empire .He was safe in the city of Ravenna with its impregnable defenses and kept putting Alaric off until he was exasperated enough to sack Rome on August 24 , 410 .Sack was perhaps too strong a word for the actions of the Visigoths .They did systematically take anything of value they could carry away , but there was no destruction of buildings or slaughter of the population .The Visigoths could not believe they had actually captured Rome and they acted more like awestruck tourist than barbarian plunderers .Meanwhile Honorius was distraught upon learning that Rome had been taken , until the messenger clarified that he meant the city and not Honorius 's pet chicken Roma .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.79697"}
{"text": "The precise nature of any illness that Hitler suffered from is unclear since he is not available for a medical examination and his body was not autopsied .The most likely theory to explain Hitler 's symptoms is that Hitler suffered from Parkinson 's Disease , as related in this article from the Daily Mail that I read recently .Parkinson 's disease may have played a crucial role in Adolf Hitler 's defeat , according to a controversial new study .The research claims the neurological disease influenced some of the dictator 's biggest decisions , making him reckless and ultimately losing World War II .But it also goes a step further to say that Hitler 's horrific and inhumane murders were also influenced by his disease , exaggerating his ' volatile temperament ' .The study was led by Raghav Gupta and a team at the University of Pittsburgh and recently published in the journal World Neurosurgery .The possibility of Hitler suffering from Parkinson 's has long been the subject of debate , ' writes Gupta .Video evidence depicts that Hitler exhibited progressive motor function deterioration from 1933 to 1945 . 'By the end of his life , Hitler had a pronounced tremor in his hands , particularly his left hand , which has caused a number of scientists to question whether he had the disease .Parkinson 's can also cause a slow gait , bent posture and a dull stare , along with cognitive disorders such as a lack of imagination and a general apathy .The researchers suggest that Hitler 's condition may have led him to attack Russia prematurely in 1941 , according to a report in Discover .A previous study claimed that Hitler 's decision to invade Russia , before defeating Britain on the western front , was a direct result of his failing health .The study points to other bad decisions of Hitler 's such the failure to defend Normandy in 1944 , alongside keeping his forces in Stalingrad in 1942 .They say this was the result of the dictator 's ' volatile temperament ' which may have been aggravated by his Parkinson 's .The study also goes on to suggest that Hitler 's lack of remorse and sympathy can be associated with his Parkinson 's .Assuming that Hitler did indeed suffer from Parkinson 's disease , how did it affect his judgement and the outcome of the war ?Hitler always was something of a gambler and a risk taker , preferring to improvise rather than making elaborate plans .This willingness to risk everything on a single throw of the dice , as it were , helped Hitler immeasurably during his rise to power in Germany and in the early years of his rule , especially since he could also be patient when it was necessary .Up until around 1937 Hitler was largely successful in obtaining his goals both inside Germany and in Germany 's relations with its neighbors .Germany seemed to have largely recovered from the Great Depression and regained its place as one of the leading nations of Germany .Had Hitler stopped then , he would possibly be regarded as a great statesman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.88168"}
{"text": "Consider the timeline leading up to the Second World War .In March 1938 , Germany invaded and annexed Austria .Almost immediately , Hitler began pressing for the session of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia on the grounds that the majority of the population were ethnic Germans and therefore the region rightly belonged to Germany .After the Munich agreement in September 1938 , the Germans occupied and annexed the Sudetenland .Then in March 1939 Germany annexed the rest of Czechoslovakia .Then Hitler demanded that Poland cede the city of Danzig to Germany and when Poland refused , he ordered the invasion of Poland on September 1 , 1939 , beginning World War II .Now , each step of Hitler 's path to the war was in itself reasonable and could perhaps be justified in terms of Germany 's national interest .No one in Europe really wanted a war , even Hitler .If he had allowed more time to elapse between his conquests , it is likely that he would have continued to lull France and Great Britain into inactivity .As it was , one move after another in quick succession thoroughly alarmed both Britain and France .They might have gone to war in any case after the invasion of Poland , but if Hitler had waited perhaps longer between conquests , Germany might have been more prepared for the war .As it was , the war really started too early for Germany .The Germans had been rearming almost since the Nazis had gained power but it would have been better if Hitler could have put it off until around 1942 or 1943 , especially since Mussolini had advised Hitler that Italy could not be ready for war until at least 1945 .Why the hurry ?By the end of 1940 , Hitler had defeated France and was the master of continental Europe with only Britain still opposing him .Then on June 22 , 1941 , Hitler invaded the Soviet Union .This was not an entirely unreasonable course of action for Germany .Hitler had good reason to suspect that Stalin was biding his time waiting for the capitalist powers to exhaust themselves in war before swooping in to bring the revolution to Europe .Moreover , Stalin 's purges had badly weakened the Red Army and Hitler could reasonably consider that it would be better to invade before Russia recovered its strength .Still , why the hurry when Hitler was still at war with Great Britain and it was increasingly obvious that it was only a matter of time before the United States intervened ?Surely Hitler could have waited another year .By that time the morale of the British people would likely to have decreased to the point that they would have been extremely receptive to some peace proposal .The Germans had also wasted valuable time in the spring and early summer of 1941 assisting Italy after its disastrous invasion of Yugoslavia .Why could n't Hitler have waited until the spring of 1942 to begin his invasion of Russia , giving the Germans plenty of time to conquer as much territory as possible before the cruel Russian winter began .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "132.64166"}
