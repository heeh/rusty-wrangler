Ted Cruz of Texas delivered a hard - fought upset win over businessman Donald Trump in the Iowa Republican caucuses Monday night , making good on his bet that a methodical campaign organization would eclipse the New Yorker 's media dominance in the first test of GOP voters .With 99 percent of the precincts reporting , Cruz was besting Trump by more than 5,100 votes , with fellow senator Marco Rubio of Florida a close third .Cruz appeared to capitalize on deep support from religious and social conservatives and showed that old - fashioned retail politicking could overcome Trump 's massive political rallies in the Hawkeye state .The final Des Moines Register poll is in ahead of today 's Iowa Caucus , and it shows that Donald Trump has the support of 28 % of likely caucus goers , with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 23 % and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 15 % .The poll was taken beginning the day after Trump announced he would skip last week 's GOP debate .Who knows whether that decision will come back to haunt him or not .We shall also see where the polls back up caucus goers .On the Democratic side , the survey finds former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with 45 % support to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ' 42 % .It is unbelievable that Sanders is so close in the polls to Hillary .Many are looking to gleam and info or data that will give us an indicator as to who might win in Iowa .In the final poll before the Iowa caucuses Monday , Donald Trump holds a slight 5-point lead over Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are neck - and - neck within the margin of error .The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics pool took place January 26 - 29 , three days before Trump skipped the GOP Iowa debate to one day after .This particular poll , which has a history of accuracy as it predicted Rick Santorum 's late surge in 2012 , shows Donald Trump as the frontrunner , but still a close race with two days to go .Trump will need the help of first - time caucus - goers to boost his chances of beating Cruz and in this poll , 40 percent say their caucusing for their first time .Trump does have weaknesses , though , in the eyes of Iowa voters who do n't like his position on eminent domain and past statements in favor of abortion rights .Cruz 's campaign has been running an ad in Iowa showing Trump in 1999 telling a reporter : \" I am very pro - choice . \"Sen.
