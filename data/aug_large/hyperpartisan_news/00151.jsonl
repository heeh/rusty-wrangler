{"text": "The Islamic radical movements are very different and pose a very unique set of threats and challenges to these nations under their radar .This article will not discuss terrorism in the Middle East but will touch on the dynamics of internal threats posed by these international terrorist groups that have strong bases inside other nations .ISIS is such a group .Spain is a country familiar with domestic terrorism .Since 1958 , Spain had to deal with groups such as ETA , a radical movement formed by students also known as \" Euskadi Eta Askatasuna . \"In Spanish the name meant \" Pais Vasco y Libertad .\"The group had a goal to gain independence from Spain to seven regions of northern Spain and in the process , they engaged in an \" Asymmetric War \" against the state with many terrorist attacks .I highlight the problem in Spain because the threat was not an external force such as al Qaeda .It was an internal conflict launched by citizens of Spain .This posed a much more difficult task for the Spanish government that had to re - think their policing and internal security programs .Another country that experienced internal terrorism for many years was Ireland and the United Kingdom .The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) was a group that had its roots inside society and inside the borders of Ireland and the UK for that matter .South of the US border , Mexico also experienced internal terrorism .In Mexico , the Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre was a domestic terrorist group .In English the 23 of September Communist League was a movement that began in 1973 , which was formed by students that were part of Christian Socialists and Marxists movements at the time .The groups that scattered all over Mexico were decentralized and they carried out kidnappings , killings , and terrorist attacks .Mexico , UK , Ireland , and Spain , to name a few , have experienced internal terrorism ( Domestic Terrorism ) and they had to deal with it by applying domestic policy .Their movements did not go out or became international movements .Thinking that ISIS still is just a regional threat and not a threat that has both domestic and international implications for the US may be a real problem .Additionally , it is possible to argue that the threat posed by ISIS could never be as well organized as the threats posed inside these nations , but today even attacks such as the attack in Nairobi , Kenya on September 2013 are attacks that can be devastating .The 2014 holiday season is just around the corner .Therefore , this also means that foreign policy and domestic policy application to terror threats are two very different animals and neither one appears to be in place to deal with ISIS , as of now .There is a big difference in how policy is applied to foreign and domestic threats .In this case , ISIS is a real and existing terror threat as to foreign policy .While it is an emerging terror threat , when it comes to domestic US policy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.32359"}
