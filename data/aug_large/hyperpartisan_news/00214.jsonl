{"text": "For example , we identified two cases where sex offenders were currently employed by California public schools , despite the fact that California has a \" subsequent arrest notifications \" process to track the criminal history of employees after they are hired .[ Footnote 8 ] For example , one school never received a subsequent arrest notification when one of its maintenance workers was convicted of sexual battery in 1999 .Since they conducted no recurring criminal history checks , school officials were unaware of the employee 's conviction until we notified them during the course of this investigation .In the other case , school officials received notice of an administrative employee 's 2000 arrest for the molestation of a minor , but did not terminate his employment because they believed they were not legally obligated to do so .These officials subsequently left the school district and did not notify current staff about the arrest .Current officials told us they did not have any reason to examine the offender 's employment file during their tenure .Consequently , these officials were not aware that they were employing a convicted sex offender until we notified them .A recurring background check would likely have alerted current staff to the offense .Red Flags on Employment Applications : Many of the schools we spoke with require job applicants to self - report basic information regarding their criminal background , but in three of our cases , schools failed to ask applicants about troubling responses .For example , an applicant for an Arizona teaching position answered yes when asked if he had been convicted of \" a dangerous crime against children . \"However , that school could provide no information to suggest that it followed up with the applicant or law enforcement about this admission before hiring the offender .The offender eventually was arrested for sexually abusing a young female student at the school .In the two remaining cases , applicants did not provide any response when asked about previous criminal history and school officials could not provide evidence that they had inquired about the discrepancy or required the applicant to provide the information .For example , a Michigan public school hired an administrative employee who had multiple convictions for sexual offenses .On his application , the offender did not respond to a question about whether he had ever been convicted of a crime , though he answered every other question on the application .Similarly , a California charter school hired an administrative employee who failed to answer a question about previous felony convictions , even though he had been convicted of a felony sex offense against a minor .Table 1 provides a summary of the 15 cases we examined ; a more detailed narrative on seven of the cases follows the table .However , this check will not reveal offenses committed in other states .California law requires all schools to conduct national fingerprint - based checks on employees .However , the search would not identify convictions in other states .To our knowledge , they are no longer exam overseers in California .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.90764"}
