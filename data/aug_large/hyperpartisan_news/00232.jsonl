{"text": "And what is this elixir ?It is simple : abolish agricultural subsidies .Not some of them , but all of them , so that there is no scope for wriggling out of it .It almost beggars belief that the Bush administration , which came into office to reduce subsidies , has actually massively increased them to farmers .This means that US farmers are paid by the US taxpayer to produce crops , such as cereals and cotton , that could be more economically produced by countries in the developing world .It is economic and social madness .In Europe , farmers in Scandinavia , thanks to EU subsidies , are growing sugar beet , a product far better suited to being grown in parts of Africa .This is barmy .Not only do African producers find it extremely difficult to sell in export markets against this subsidised competition , but they are even undercut in their home markets by surplus EU beet produced at ludicrously subsidised prices .Abolishing agricultural subsidies is , virtually , a free lunch .Practically everyone gains .PRIME MINISTER : .The other point to remind you of is that the assessment that the British made , they are still standing by .I mean everybody is going around incorrectly saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency has concluded a document was forged .But what the British are saying is put that aside because they have other evidence .JOURNALIST : Prime Minister , you claim that weapons of mass destruction will be found , as times goes by without having found any are you more convinced ( inaudible ) ?PRIME MINISTER : .There were clear , compelling intelligence assessments available to the effect that Iraq had a WMD capacity and nothing I have seen since has shaken the assessments that were made at that time .We have a pure repeat of the Children Overboard affair where information available to the prime minister 's office mysteriously failed to reach the prime minister .Just as with that incident the prime minister tells us he did not know until long after he had milked it for every political advantage he could gain .Update From the Sydney Morning Herald The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ( DFAT ) admitted last night that it knew intelligence on Iraq 's nuclear program was questionable shortly before the Prime Minister , John Howard , presented it to Parliament to build a case for war .The revelation will deepen the damaging controversy about the Government 's use of flawed intelligence on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction capabilities .The department claims it did not tell Mr Howard or the Foreign Minister , Alexander Downer , of information from the American State Department in January that cast doubt on claims that Iraq was seeking uranium from Africa .This follows the extraordinary admission yesterday by Australia 's peak intelligence agency , the Office of National Assessments ( ONA ) , that it received the same information but had also failed to pass it on to Mr Howard .So now the foreign affairs department as well as the office of national assessments have mysteriously failed to make ministers aware of things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.71245"}

'Obama operatives stole my original 2009 tapes but we have new ones .I am left in a state of amazement .Obama paid a horrible political price for his refusal to release this document although it will probably satisfy most people who had concerns .Why did he fight so long and so hard to avoid release ?As of yet there is no answer to that question . \"No doubt Obama 's inner circle ultimately agreed with me -- Obama was losing the battle of public perception .Even Jay Carney said Trump / Martin were a ' distraction .

{"text": "After consulting with the State Department 's African Affairs Bureau ( and through it with Barbro Owens - Kirkpatrick , the United States ambassador to Niger ) , I agreed to make the trip .The mission I undertook was discreet but by no means secret .While the C.I.A. paid my expenses ( my time was offered pro bono ) , I made it abundantly clear to everyone I met that I was acting on behalf of the United States government .In late February 2002 , I arrived in Niger 's capital , Niamey , where I had been a diplomat in the mid-70 's and visited as a National Security Council official in the late 90 's .The city was much as I remembered it .Seasonal winds had clogged the air with dust and sand .Through the haze , I could see camel caravans crossing the Niger River ( over the John F. Kennedy bridge ) , the setting sun behind them .Most people had wrapped scarves around their faces to protect against the grit , leaving only their eyes visible .The next morning , I met with Ambassador Owens - Kirkpatrick at the embassy .For reasons that are understandable , the embassy staff has always kept a close eye on Niger 's uranium business .I was not surprised , then , when the ambassador told me that she knew about the allegations of uranium sales to Iraq - and that she felt she had already debunked them in her reports to Washington .Nevertheless , she and I agreed that my time would be best spent interviewing people who had been in government when the deal supposedly took place , which was before her arrival .I spent the next eight days drinking sweet mint tea and meeting with dozens of people : current government officials , former government officials , people associated with the country 's uranium business .It did not take long to conclude that it was highly doubtful that any such transaction had ever taken place .Given the structure of the consortiums that operated the mines , it would be exceedingly difficult for Niger to transfer uranium to Iraq .Niger 's uranium business consists of two mines , Somair and Cominak , which are run by French , Spanish , Japanese , German and Nigerian interests .If the government wanted to remove uranium from a mine , it would have to notify the consortium , which in turn is strictly monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency .Moreover , because the two mines are closely regulated , quasi - governmental entities , selling uranium would require the approval of the minister of mines , the prime minister and probably the president .In short , there 's simply too much oversight over too small an industry for a sale to have transpired .( As for the actual memorandum , I never saw it .But news accounts have pointed out that the documents had glaring errors - they were signed , for example , by officials who were no longer in government - and were probably forged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "122.61901"}
