Scott and David A. Wolfe , University of Western Ontario , Canada .Published : Journal of Interpersonal Violence , V. 15 ( 8) , August 2000 , 827 - 842 .What is the scope of this study ?Treatment programs for men who abuse their intimate partners have been in existence since the 1970s and have become a popular remedy used by the criminal justice system to address the problem of domestic violence .However , between 1989 and 1998 six major studies that examined treatment outcome literature on batterer programs revealed no significant difference in \" recidivism rates \" of batterers who participated in treatment compared to those who did not .The authors of the present study suggest that a lack of theoretical and empirical information about how to get violent men to curtail or stop behaving violently towards their partners could lie behind treatment ineffectiveness .Of note is the lack of connection between research findings about batterers and theories of domestic violence and behavior change .In the present study , the authors conducted a qualitative investigation of successful batterer treatment .They described the perceptions of batterers who succeeded in changing their behavior toward intimate partners , and compared these accounts of success to theories about domestic violence and behavior change .What is qualitative analysis ?Qualitative analysis is a \" discovery - oriented approach . \" In this study it allowed researchers to gather in - depth descriptions and explanations of behavior change by former batterers .Such information is then used to clarify or elaborate upon empirical findings , or to challenge or explain theories .How was the study conducted ?Linking successful batterer treatment with theory .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.82324"}

{"text": "Men have great needs for status and independence ( emphasis on separate and different ) ; women have needs for intimacy and connection ( emphasis on close and same ) .Women need to receive caring , understanding , respect , devotion , validation .Women are motivated when they feel special , c herished .Men need to receive trust , acceptance , appreciation , admiration , approva l , encouragement .Men are motivated when they feel needed .A man 's deepest fear is that he is not good enough or not competent enough , though he may never express this .Responding to Men 's Sexual Concerns : Research and Intervention in Slum Communities in Mumbai , India .Much of the responsibility for the transmission of HIV / STD lies with men involved in sexually risky behavior .While there are many programs aimed at reducing men 's risky behavior , insufficient attention has been paid to men 's perspectives on sexual health and the cultural context within which men engage in risky behavior .This paper reports on a multi - year , multi - level research and intervention project to assess men 's culturally based sexual health concerns and to utilize those concerns in the development of HIV / STD risk reduction and treatment programs in urban poor communities in Mumbai ( Bombay ) , India .The intervention approach consists of community - level education , training of both public allopathic and private nonallopathic providers and a treatment modality that centers on syndromic diagnosis and management , behavioral change , and a therapeutic approach based on narrative and cognitive therapy termed the \" narrative intervention model .\" The project 's pre - post , control , and experimental design allows evaluation of impact at each intervention level .Keywords : men , sexual problems , HIV , STD , culturally based intervention , risky sexual behavior .Much of the literature with regard to men 's involvement in reproductive health emphasizes men 's reluctance to address their own health , the health of their sexual partners , and the health of their children .As a result , programs directed toward men and reproductive health have emphasized expansion of their health knowledge , a redefinition of their gender roles , a reduction of their risky behaviors , and an increased utilization of healthcare services .Although the challenges and obstacles have been apparent , the answers have not been so easily forthcoming .This paper suggests that before we move to the change mode , we need to carefully and systematically listen to and observe men within local communities to identify their unique concerns and utilize that knowledge for the development of change opportunities .One such opportunity emerged in the assessment of men 's sexual health problems and development of prevention programs for HIV / STD risk reduction in slum communities in Mumbai , India .The concern about men 's sexual health and the health of their sexual partners is set in the context of the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS and increasing rates of STDs in India .It is now estimated that more than five million individuals are living with HIV / AIDS in India , a prevalence of 0.9 % ( National AIDS Control Organization , 2004 ; UNAIDS , 2004 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.88253"}
{"text": "From these , 28 \" coding categories \" were created against which participants ' responses were compared to evaluate which aspects of theory were most salient to batterers ' success in stopping violent behavior .In this way researchers hoped to link successful batterer treatment with existing theories in the field .Participants .Participants were drawn from among men who had participated in a 20-week group treatment for batterers at Changing Ways , Inc. , in London , Ontario , Canada .Nine men met criteria to be in the study .Study participants were those men who had succeeded in \" changing abusive behavior through treatment \" and had maintained that change for at least six months between January 1998 and July 1999 .Participants , their intimate partners and Changing Ways ' counselors evaluated men 's success at changing abusive behavior .Qualitative research methods .Skilled clinicians conducted hour - long , semi - structured interviews with each subject in private .The interviews were designed to encourage participants to freely talk about their experiences of behavior change .Both \" grand - tour \" and more specific questioning helped participants identify factors that contributed to changing their abusive behavior .Two , independent raters evaluated and coded participants ' narratives , then matched accounts of abusive behavior change with the 28 \" coding categories \" drawn from theories described above .Only those factors that participants mentioned twice or more were deemed important in the process of behavior change and used for coding purposes .Reliability between raters was 80 % .What were the study 's findings ?Participants endorsed twenty - one of 28 coding categories .This meant that there was general agreement between participants ' perceptions of what helped them change and theories of abuse development and behavior change .Four factors stood out as most important to the men in changing their abusive behavior .Seventy - five percent of the men endorsed the following factors : .Recognizing and taking responsibility for past abusive behavior - this was achieved in treatment through discussions with group facilitators and listening to the experiences of other group members .Developing empathy for others , most specifically , for intimate partners - in particular , participants came to understand how fear , intimidation and the cumulative effect of \" controlling behaviors \" had affected their relationships with intimate partners .Reducing dependency - this issue included accepting sole responsibility to change abusive behavior , and that their intimate partners were autonomous beings with a right to feelings , to make decisions and to have privacy about those feelings and decisions .Improving skills for communicating needs , feelings and other difficult topics - most importantly : .Anger management .Conflict management and resolution .Learning how to listen to partners during difficult discussions .Learning how to share feelings and have intimate conversations .What were the implications of this study for batterer treatment ?Included in some batterer group treatment programs are interventions that attempt to change men 's attitudes towards women , beliefs or personality characteristics .The findings in this study suggest that perhaps interventions that help men learn how to have healthier intimate relationships are more important for helping stop domestic violence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.51697"}
