John McCain , but some Hispanics have become disillusioned with Obama because of his failure to deliver on promises to overhaul immigration policy .Obama , who visited as a candidate in May 2008 , sought to assure his Puerto Rican listeners they were not forgotten by his administration .In remarks at an arrival event at the airport in San Juan , Obama quickly turned to the decades - old debate about the island 's status , which has some pushing for statehood or even independence .The president reaffirmed his support for a referendum in which island voters would resolve the matter for themselves , eliciting cheers when he said : \" When the people of Puerto Rico make a clear decision , my administration will stand by you .\" The words could resonate not just here but with the millions of Puerto Rican voters on the mainland , including more than 800,000 in politically important Florida , where Obama stayed overnight Monday before flying here Tuesday morning .Democrats see the Puerto Ricans in Florida as a potential counterbalance to the larger , traditionally Republican Cuban - American community in a state Obama needs to win a second term .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.73799"}

Martin O'Malley , for being willing to raise taxes on people she terms middle class - a broad definition that reaches nearly to the top tier of incomes .Although they objected to the lack of detail , the Clinton campaign staffers evidently had enough details to launch a harsh critique of Sanders ' concept of universal health care . \" Clinton believes , given the problems of income inequality , the last thing that we should be doing is raising taxes on the middle class , \" Sullivan said .\" She has said many times that we need to give middle - class families a raise , not a tax increase .\" What about the contention from Sanders that any extra costs from taxes would be offset with boosts in disposable income once people no longer need to pay for insurance ?\" From our perspective , it is far from clear that everyone would in fact save money from Sen. Sanders ' plan , \" Sullivan said .\" In fact , we believe that many middle - class and working families would be worse off under this plan .\" The Clinton campaign has dug in deep against Sanders on health care this week .Although single - payer health care might be a political longshot after the drawn - out fight over the more moderate Obamacare , attacking the merits of single - payer in a Democratic primary is a strange strategic choice for the Clinton campaign .A poll from a progressive group last year found that about 80 percent of Democrats support single - payer .But Clinton seems intent on doubling down on the sort of arguments you typically hear from Republicans , claiming that her opponent is too focused on taking money away from voters for big government programs .Greg Allen .As NPR 's Miami correspondent , Greg Allen reports on the diverse issues and developments tied to the Southeast .He covers everything from breaking news to economic and political stories to arts and human interest features .He moved into this role in 2006 , after four years as NPR 's Midwest correspondent .Allen was a key part of NPR 's coverage of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti , providing some of the first reports on the disaster .He was on the frontlines of NPR 's coverage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , arriving in New Orleans before the storm hit and filing on the chaos and flooding that hit the city as the levees broke .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.996574"}

{"text": "Her juxtaposition of the economy and bigotry bugs me a little .The implication , of course , is that Sanders is n't paying as much attention to bigotry as Clinton thinks he should -- and later she expressed disappointment that bigotry issues were n't addressed more during the debate itself .This is all important to her , I presume , because those issues make up much of her \" progressive \" bona fides .As the Democratic contest has intensified this month , Clinton has grown very defensive of her progressive credentials , and more convinced that they should be self - evident .During the debate she scoffed that \" Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me , a woman running to be the first woman president , as exemplifying the establishment .\" If that makes a candidate progressive , then Margaret Thacher was a progressive when she ran for Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1979 , and Carly Fiorina today is as progressive as Clinton , just as Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachman were when they were running in 2012 .Clinton is , in fact , very resentful , treating just about any criticism of herself as a \" smear \" while , of course , she 's merely \" pointing out the differences \" when she goes negative on Sanders .But to return from the tangent , \" progressivism \" has to mean something in an exclusionary way or else the word is meaningless .If we are unable to say with some confidence that someone is \" not progressive , \" there 's no point to saying she is progressive .In such a case , \" gatekeeping \" is an obligation not just on an allegedly self - appointed figure like Sanders but on anyone for whom the word \" progress \" has meaning .Of course , \" progress \" does n't mean the same thing even for all self - styled progressives , which is why the Democrats are having debates while many other progressives will be satisfied with neither candidate .Clinton and Sanders represent two strains of , or claims to progressivism .Sanders 's vision is radical and universal .He wants to break up the big banks and push through single - payer health insurance , among other goals .Clinton 's vision is incremental and self - consciously inclusive .It is insistent that progress include women , racial minorities , the LGBTs , etc . , not only as beneficiaries but as enactors of progress .To some progressives , this seems to matter more than any material progress made by the people or the nation as a whole .Clinton practices what might be called retail progressivsm .Again , to retail progressives , this is progress from a past defined by inequality , bigotry and exploitation , and this may be another key to the difference in attitude between two kinds of progressivism .One faction looks backward and defines progress relative to an unjust past , while the other looks forward and sets goals for progress that have less to do with the redressing the past .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.21598"}
