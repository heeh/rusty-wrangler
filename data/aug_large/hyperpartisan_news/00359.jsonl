Foyt , the Texan , ranks as the best American driver ever .He is the only driver to have won the Daytona 500 , the Indianapolis 500 , the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 24 Hours of Le Mans .Foyt won under 10 numbers in NASCAR and USAC open - wheel competition but is most associated with No . 14 , winning 30 open - wheel races with it .Foyt is glad that numbers stay in circulation with NASCAR .I do n't think you should retire them , ' ' Foyt said .\" If somebody great wants to run with a number , it 's a big honor on your behalf for them to run that number . ' 'That is why Foyt gladly gave his blessing when Stewart asked for permission to switch to the No . 14 with the debut of his Stewart - Haas Racing team in 2009 .Stewart is the Foyt of this generation , a hard - boiled racer comfortable with anything that has an engine .I was awful glad Tony wanted that number , \" Foyt said .\" I did n't think anybody would ever run with it .Winning under multiple numbers .Bobby Allison 's never settled on one number as his favorite .My first favorite number was the 2 , and I won my first race in the 2 , said Allison , the Cup champion in 1983 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.20225"}
