{"text": "As to why I used homicide rates instead of gun death rates which include suicide which invalidates many of you claims .Take your example of Israel they have tougher gun laws then Canada but nearly 2x the gun homicide rate but almost half the gun death rate .Also many countries do not track gun death rates so places like Russia with 2/3 of nonmilitary guns being illegal and having higher over twice the homicide rate as the US while having much stricter gun laws sure paints a compelling picture .So let 's take a look at the things that you 're saying that are n't true , first .Switzerland - Every adult MALE is issued an assault rifle , WHEN THEY GO INTO THE MILITIA , at the age of 18 - when they are trained to use them .If they want to keep them , however , they remove the autofire , so it 's no longer a \" true assault rifle \" , whatever you meant by that .If they want to actually CARRY the guns , they have to go through an extensive permitting process , where basically everyone who does n't have a need to carry ( people in the security field ) get rejected .So , then , you agree with OP 's premise that the issue is n't availability of firearms , but rather is a cultural one .The NRA 's Wayne LaPierre Has the Blood of Connecticut Children on His Hands .The NRA 's Wayne LaPierre Has the Blood of Connecticut Children on His Hands .The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has a 62-page list of mass shootings in America since 2005 .It is Wayne LaPierre 's resume .For the past 21 years , LaPierre has been the National Rifle Association 's executive Vice President and chief political strategist .It is tempting to say that these shootings - including the most recent one at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Connecticut on Friday - reflect something basically wrong with American culture or the nation 's very soul .But the majority of Americans favor strict gun control laws .No , let 's not burden Americans with collective guilt .The problem is more narrow - and more fixable - than that .The long list of killings is due in large measure to the political influence of the NRA - and the campaign finance system that allows the gun lobby to exercise so much power .But an outraged and mobilized public can beat the NRA 's clout and pressure Congress to put strong limits on gun sales .The blood of the 26 victims of the Connecticut shooting , including 20 young children , is on LaPierre 's hands .Of course , LaPierre did n't pull the trigger , but he 's the NRA 's hit man when it comes to intimidating elected officials to oppose any kind of gun control and the nation 's most vocal advocate of gun owner rights .There should be special place in hell reserved for LaPierre .He likes to fulminate about gun owners ' rights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.67257"}
