Alan 's mother begins speaking at 1:00 .I am the mother of murder victim Alan Blueford .18 years old .On May 6th , 2012 .I can not begin to tell you what this has done to my life , to my family .My life has been shattered , and I am not trying to put together the pieces of my life , after the loss of my baby son .Alan was a good boy .We were very close .our joy and our closeness .This was the time of year of celebration in Alan 's life when he was graduating Skyline High School .Alan did n't make it to graduation day , but his father and I were there to see his diploma , because of the senseless murder that took place on May 6th .I am asking today for the police report , for the coroner 's report .I do n't want another mother , another family member , sister , brother , niece , nephew , cousin , grandmother , to feel the pain that we have felt to this senseless tragedy .I 'm asking today because I , as his mother , his parents deserve to know what happen to our baby .We 've been asking for over two months , and all that we 've gotten is mistreatment .We 've been told different stories .They 've done everything against us and not nothing to support us .The police department is here to protect and serve .I have not got any service .Today we ask for information so that we may have a chance to come to grips with this and have the opportunity to place the scattered pieces of our life back together .I can not bring Alan back .He is gone on to rest in Jesus .But I do deserve as his mother to know what has happened to my child .Reports are all that we have , and we would like answers .Thank you .The Blueford 's are concerned not only about what happened to their son .They have be able to see beyond a family tragedy to recognize the systemic injustice of a system that treats being a young black male standing on a street corner with friends as probable cause .In that light the Blueford family and the Justice 4 Alan Blueford Coalition are demanding not only that the officer involved be fired and charged with murder , but also .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.09102"}

Massar .Justice4AlanBlueford via Daily Kos .Since the shooting death of Trayvon Martin , there have been closed to 30 Black or Brown people shot and killed by law enforcement or in the case of Trayvon , wannabe law enforcement .Many of these shootings have been highly questionable , meaning the person killed was unarmed or there are strong conflicting statements from either the police or witnesses .Alan Blueford , killed by Oakland Police on the evening of May 6 , 2012 .He was out with his buddies at night , unaware that he was under martial law .He would have graduated from High School in June ( Credit : Facebook ) .Here in Oakland , California , the shooting death Alan Dwayne Blueford is one such killing .Oakland police have been very shady with the stories they put forth to the public .It seems like a deliberate attempt to muddy the waters , cast seeds of doubt and cover up their own mistakes .Initially police said they were in a shoot out and Blueford shot the officer in the stomach .Later the police said Blueford shot the officer in the leg .Next the police said that it was possible the officer was shot in the leg by another officer in a case of friendly fire .Finally it came out that the officer shot himself .He shot himself in the foot .Many believe the officer shot himself after he killed Blueford and saw the young man was unarmed .The police then double back and said a gun was recovered , the community has yet to see any evidence of finger prints , gun residue etc .Many have concluded it was the officer planting a gun near the scen .This would not be unusual in a city that in the past 10 years has had to shell out over 58 million dollars in wrongful death shootings and police brutality incidents .This would not be far - fetched in a city that was home to a rogue group of cops known as the Riders who were found to routinely plant drugs and guns on suspects .One of the Oakland Riders is a still a fugitive at large .Adding to all this was the fact that Blueford was left to on the ground for 4 hours to die while the officer who lied and then finally admitted to shooting himself was treated .The public still does not know the name of the officer thanks to California 's Policeman 's Bill of Rights which prevents the public from knowing the name of officers involved in these and other brutality incidents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.575035"}

{"text": "I want to write of the struggle to deal with it in a way that respects the dignity of the mentally ill and also the need to protect the common good .As for my sister Mary Anne and of her 30 year struggle with mental illness , I wrote last week .She had moments of great lucidity , and peace .But these moments were often punctuated by deep troubles , wherein she heard \" the voices \" who instructed her to do terrible things , acts of violence , acts that harmed her and others .In these , \" dark moments \" she perpetrated acts of violence , breaking into stores , engaging , not only in shoplifting , but also , it attempted armed robbery , breaking and entering , and other , almost pointless destruction of property .Many times she turned on herself , several times slashing her wrists , taking overdoses , trying to jump to her death .Once , she accosted my mother with a long carving knife .Another time , she successfully stabbed my mother , wounding her seriously in the middle of the night , while she slept .My sister also , set fires , and would ultimately die in a fire that she kindled .And yet in all of this , my sister Mary Anne , had many lucid moments , wherein she was gentle , kind , helpful and deeply concerned for the well - being of all of us .She was a beautiful human being who struggled mightily to keep her mental health , in the face of a horrible affliction that often overtook her .She loved God , and like all of us , sought his face and the serenity and healing that only God can give .In all of this , my parents too were engaged in a great battle .It was not a battle that was not easily defined .It was a battle that sought to protect my sisters rights , and her dignity .But it was also a battle that sought to protect the common good , which my parents rightly thought was threatened by my sister 's instability .Early in my sister 's struggle with mental illness , she was confined to the rather protected environment of mental hospitals .That said , men of these places were not pleasant .And my parents , expended many personal resources , and money to ensure that my sister was in the best of possible environments .But honestly , the protected environment of a mental hospital was best for her , that is where she an others were best protected .Somewhere , in the late 1970s , as I recall , the ACLU , and other interest groups , sued the federal government , claiming that many were being unjustly detained in mental hospitals .Having lost a series of suits , the government largely emptied the mental hospitals , resulting in a great exodus of the seriously mentally ill into our streets .As most of you know , the \" homelessness \" problem , in our large cities , was deeply rooted in mental illness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.342926"}

{"text": "marty mcfly .It was not reported that he rushed the officer .It was reported that he turn around and was facing the officer after being shot the first time and then that was reported as rushing ...Black kids are more likely to be shot by police across the board regardless of the situation .All witnesses on the scene said he was gunned down unlawfully .The account of the officer defending himself came from somebody who actually did nt see the shooting and was not on the scene .The other account of him \" doubling back \" after being shot the first time came from an eye witness but he did not say Mike Brown \" rushed \" the officer .Now lets take the race out and say that a white kid was shot six times by a cop and he was unarmed ?That is a problem , why ?Because tax payers pay for the police department and the police are a service of the people and taxpayers ai nt paying for six bullets to be fired in unarmed 18 year olds .If a white kid is unarmed and gunned down with six bullets that is still a problem .I m black btw and regardless of him stealing from the store I think when you have trained police and unarmed 18 year olds and six bullets are left in their upper body ? and four eye witnesses say he caught five of those bullets while on his knees after being struck by the first bullet .There 's definitely room to suggest that was a murder .And again , if Mike Brown was white it would still be a problem .el jim chapo guzman .marty mcfly .I think there is probably a write up about that situation and it made local news but not national news .Had there been a protest ( where some rioting and looting happened ) and then a militarized police / nation guard response over the situation that last for a week happened then it probably would be covered more .Black people are not the majority of even half the population here in america so it has to be something when black people are 5 times more likely to be stopped by the police .No matter how you wanna box black people as if all black people are thugs and potential suspects you still got ta say black people are the ones living under what whites would call a police state .When you talk to alot of white people they all upset about police doing this and that and they talk about how police make it like neighborhoods are militarized concentration camps but what race of people are really subjected to that type of treatment everyday ? el jim chapo guzman .marty mcfly .WTF , I mean ok whatever but I was talking about something else . el jim chapo guzman .It 's not racist if one has the common sense to know you do n't get shot in the front if you 're running away , nor in the arms if your hands are raised in the air .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.11627"}

{"text": "Then suddenly , he moved out of state .A SUDDEN MOVE , WHY ?I always wondered why Julian decided to move out of state so suddenly .Then two stories were told to me , one by a social worker and one by my mother .I had called a social worker Susan S. perhaps two years after Rudy had been adopted out of the family to inquire how Margaret was doing .Susan said that a short time before , Margaret had been arrested for shop lifting , a compulsive problem she had had for years .Part of her defense was that she had tried to sue Dr. Julian Taplin for having sexually assaulted her as an underage teen .Nothing came of the case , but it was filed in the state of Oregon and he was notified .This would have transpired in the fall of 1986 .Then within a few short months , he had fled Oregon and moved out of state .One has to wonder if he chose to flee the state of Oregon because of this new legal situation .Margaret had tried to secure some measure of justice for herself and it had not worked .Perhaps this revealing essay will provide the justice and disclosure she was unable to create .CONCLUSION .My sister Margaret suffered from mental illness and it was mental illness that prevented her from thinking clearly or logically , therefore , she was not able or willing to advocate for herself in a healthy manner and died prematurely as a result .The sexual violation she suffered at the hands of a morally bankrupt Psychologist , Dr. Julian Taplin , decades earlier , contributed very clearly , and in quite a colossal manner to that mental deterioration and eventual breakdown .Dr. Julian Taplin committed a reprehensible violation of trust and she was taught by his amoral example , that indeed she could trust no one !It was this violation that led to her inability to trust and seek help , and both realities are tied to her tragic fate !Another repercussion of this history of felony sexual abuse and mental illness was that my sister probably suffered from tremendous guilt at losing her only child .No parent wants to willingly acknowledge that they are unable to care for their child .Especially a mother like Maggie , who desperately loved her darling son Rudy , ( now 30-years - old and reunited with his family for the past nine years ) .I know she must be so proud of him , as we are ; as a highly talented artist and determined college student , completing his degrees and earning straight A 's .Her son Rudy will always be her greatest achievement , her most precious gift to this world and her truest lasting legacy .When I remember Maggie , I will always recall the last time I saw her ; she was 27-years - old and in full bloom .With youth , beauty and the promise of good health , she seemed strong and invincible as she walked into my mother 's house on NW Thurman street .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.22604"}

'But he goes on to add : ' Most perpetrators of autogenic massacres do not , however , appear to have active psychotic symptoms at the time and very few even have histories of prior contact with mental health services . ' \" And most people with mental illness are not violent , although they are far more likely to be victims of crime ( see here , for instance ) .The continual disregard for this reality perpetuates stigma on all levels of society and further exposes those with mental illness to harm .5 ) Antipsychotics and antidepressants are not designed for children and most of them are not indicated for disruptive behaviour in children .Zyprexa , the prescription given to the child in the article , is not indicated for disruptive behaviour or autism in the US .However , there is no criticism of psychiatric or pharmaceutical practice in the article : merely a cry for more of the same .6 ) You are NOT Adam Lanza 's mother .Do n't do that .Share this : .Like this : . 599 Comments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.941666"}

{"text": "It must expand !It must expand !A man 's brain must expand , if it breaks up the universe .\" You Are Not Adam Lanza 's Mother .Edit : a post subsequent to the response to this one can be found here .After this blog post was republished on Huffington Post , I thought it necessary to summarise the main reasons why it 's a terrible springboard for further conversation on the subject . 1 )The suggestion that this woman 's son is of the same type of person who would or will commit a \" rage murder \" , without any real evidence to back up this suggestion . 2 )The article does n't divulge , or even acknowledge , that its subject might have his own perspectives , beliefs and motivations that are worth mentioning .His mother 's perspective , mainly on his ' evil eyes ' with their ' calculated pupils ' is the only one given .Thus the child is presented solely as a problem , or at best , as a two - dimensional contradiction of his \" behavioural problems \" and his \" intelligence \" and not as a person with any more than shallow emotions .By reducing ' mental illness ' to ' outward behaviour ' the article dehumanises the mentally ill and completely glosses over the inner mental life and experiences of those with mental illness . 3 )The article complains about mental illness stigma while reinforcing it by explicitly tying it to violence , and in particular , mass killings .The reality is that there is no such observed link : \" after analysing a number of killers , Mullen concludes , ' they had personality problems and were , to put it mildly , deeply troubled people . 'But he goes on to add : ' Most perpetrators of autogenic massacres do not , however , appear to have active psychotic symptoms at the time and very few even have histories of prior contact with mental health services . ' \" And most people with mental illness are not violent , although they are far more likely to be victims of crime ( see here , for instance ) .The continual disregard for this reality perpetuates stigma on all levels of society and further exposes those with mental illness to harm .5 ) Antipsychotics and antidepressants are not designed for children and most of them are not indicated for disruptive behaviour in children .Zyprexa , the prescription given to the child in the article , is not indicated for disruptive behaviour or autism in the US .However , there is no criticism of psychiatric or pharmaceutical practice in the article : merely a cry for more of the same .6 ) You are NOT Adam Lanza 's mother .Do n't do that .Share this : .Like this : . 599 Comments .Did we read the same article ?Sounds like you read what you wanted to read in order to call somebody out about it and ... what ?Feel better about yourself ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.95549"}
