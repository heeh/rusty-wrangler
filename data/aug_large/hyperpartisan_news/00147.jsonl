Highway \" when casinos sprouted along it in the 1950s .But some did call it Highway 91 , he adds , citing Guy McAfee changing the name of the Pair O ' Dice to the 91 Club in 1938 .By any name , O'Connell hopes to brand the name as he has with the Faster Horses Festival in Michigan and Watershed in central Washington .\" There is more to it than a stage in a parking lot with a bunch of bands , \" he says .O'Connell sits on of the Academy of Country Music 's board of directors , but says the festival 's arrival this year is coincidental to next year 's awards show and peripheral events ditching Las Vegas for Cowboys Stadium in Texas .And he did n't seem concerned about another outdoor festival , Life Is Beautiful , trying to share the same October weather just three weekends later .\" We 're singularly country and we 're going to drive that point home . \"Promoters will emphasize that the festival offers full sets with full production , despite the outdoor setting .The Lot also will host a Sept. 27 Kings of Leon concert originally slated for the MGM Grand Garden arena .Asked about the sudden interest in an outdoor lot when four sports arenas and the Live Nation - booked Axis theater at Planet Hollywood lie within a few miles , O'Connell cited \" an opportunity with this piece of property in a town that does major event after major event . \"As MGM Resorts kept improving the site , \" I finally saw the vision of what they had in mind to use this incredibly valuable piece of real estate .\" The festival is likely another nail in the decline of peripheral events surrounding the National Finals Rodeo in December .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.39607"}
