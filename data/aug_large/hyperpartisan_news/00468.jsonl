Clark .The abstract sums up the situation neatly .Both the public and sentencing judges regard silenced firearms as more dangerous than ordinary unsilenced firearms , and the federal penalty for possession of a silenced firearm during crime is a 30-year mandatory minimum .The assumption that silenced firearms are more dangerous than ordinary firearms has never been empirically researched .This study examines federal and state court data to compile statistics on who is being prosecuted for possession of silencers and what crimes they are used to commit .This data indicates that both on the federal and state level those prosecuted for crimes involving silencers are far less likely to have a criminal record , and are far less likely to actively use their weapon than those people convicted using ordinary unsilenced firearms .The data indicates that use of silenced firearms in crime is a rare occurrence , and is a minor problem .Moreover , the legislative history of silencer statutes indicates that these provisions were adopted with little or no debate .The silencer penalty has been justified by a need to crack down on \" professional criminals \" or to punish people using \" dangerous weapons .\" The evidence suggests that 30-year minimum sentences make no sense .Mandatory minimums should be repealed and sentencing judges permitted to treat each case on an individualized basis .I was thinking recently about how pointless many laws are .Too often legislation is written and passed in an attempt to solve ( or appear to be attempting to solve ) some real or perceived problem , but without any intelligent consideration as to whether there is any logical or practical value to the legislation .Silencer laws seem to fit neatly into that category .It 's not that anyone would be hard pressed to obtain a working silencer as there is a volume of information available on the internet and construction plans are easily available as well .So if a criminal thought that it would be advantageous for him to have a silenced firearm there would be little to stop him from doing so .Again it turns out that like most laws of this type the people it controls is the law abiding citizens and has no effect on the criminals who do n't obey the laws anyway .The author of the paper mentioned above did come up with some historical background on how silencers became dangerous in the eyes of the courts and the politicians .Legislative History of Federal Silencer Regulation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.15101"}

Clark .The abstract sums up the situation neatly .Both the public and sentencing judges regard silenced firearms as more dangerous than ordinary unsilenced firearms , and the federal penalty for possession of a silenced firearm during crime is a 30-year mandatory minimum .The assumption that silenced firearms are more dangerous than ordinary firearms has never been empirically researched .This study examines federal and state court data to compile statistics on who is being prosecuted for possession of silencers and what crimes they are used to commit .This data indicates that both on the federal and state level those prosecuted for crimes involving silencers are far less likely to have a criminal record , and are far less likely to actively use their weapon than those people convicted using ordinary unsilenced firearms .The data indicates that use of silenced firearms in crime is a rare occurrence , and is a minor problem .Moreover , the legislative history of silencer statutes indicates that these provisions were adopted with little or no debate .The silencer penalty has been justified by a need to crack down on \" professional criminals \" or to punish people using \" dangerous weapons .\" The evidence suggests that 30-year minimum sentences make no sense .Mandatory minimums should be repealed and sentencing judges permitted to treat each case on an individualized basis .I was thinking recently about how pointless many laws are .Too often legislation is written and passed in an attempt to solve ( or appear to be attempting to solve ) some real or perceived problem , but without any intelligent consideration as to whether there is any logical or practical value to the legislation .Silencer laws seem to fit neatly into that category .It 's not that anyone would be hard pressed to obtain a working silencer as there is a volume of information available on the internet and construction plans are easily available as well .So if a criminal thought that it would be advantageous for him to have a silenced firearm there would be little to stop him from doing so .Again it turns out that like most laws of this type the people it controls is the law abiding citizens and has no effect on the criminals who do n't obey the laws anyway .The author of the paper mentioned above did come up with some historical background on how silencers became dangerous in the eyes of the courts and the politicians .Legislative History of Federal Silencer Regulation .The history of silencer regulation is complicated , and the documentation of why various provisions were passed is sparse .Courts that have tried to determine the legislative history of some of these provisions have expressed dismay at the paucity of information in the legislative record ( U.S. v.

Snapping your fingers smartly will get 115dB. That 's a 48dB reduction .Plenty below hearing safe threshold .I think there can be a great benefit to suppressing rifles shooting supersonic ammo .While the bullet flight noise is louder , the muzzle blast is still suppressed by a great deal .Shooting under weather protection can result in noise levels that are not hearing safe though ; this is what I experienced shooting my suppressed ar-15 .No , by and large they are n't .Especially if you are comparing them to the mythical \" Hollywood \" suppressor that lets you shoot in the next room without alerting people in the hallway .Basically a firearm 's sound has three elements : supersonic bullet flight noise ( a mini - supersonic boom that accompanies the bullet ) , expanding supersonic gases at the muzzle ( muzzle noise ) and action noise ( the noise of the action cycling ) .Most suppressors only act to reduce the muzzle noise ( although the MP5SD suppressor I am familiar with also reduces muzzle velocity ) .I am sure the suppressor you mention is quiet since by using subsonic rounds it eliminates supersonic flight noise .By using a bolt action , it eliminates both action noise and any venting of gases through the open action .That leaves only the gases exiting the muzzle , which is where the suppressor does its work .However , all of these require compromises in order to achieve that level of quietness ( no semi - autos , subsonic ballistics ) .Most suppressed firearms do n't address all three categories though .And all of that ignores another category - impact noise .Your .300Whisper may be as loud as a finger snap ; but I bet that 220gr SMK moving out at 1040fps makes a big racket when it hits something - particularly inside a structure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.934494"}

{"text": "In a perfect world , you 'd order a suppressor for every gun you own .But when you consider the fact that good suppressors run anywhere from $ 400 up to $ 1,500 + , it quickly becomes apparent that unless you 're a trust fund baby or Internet millionaire , you 're going to have to be somewhat more selective .It 's also worth remembering that on top of the purchase price , there 's that $ 200 transfer tax stamp for each suppressor you buy .The good news is that suppressors can usually span multiple calibers within certain limitations .Generally speaking , a suppressor for one caliber can usually be used on smaller calibers although there will be a bit of hit in terms of reduced sound suppression .For example , a .30 suppressor can be used on a .223 rifle , but it wo n't be quite as quiet as a suppressor that 's designed for the .223 .I own a fairly varied collection of guns with rifles in the .22 , .223 , 300 Blackout , .308 .and .300Winchester Magnum calibers along with several pistols that include .22 , .357 Sig , .40 , and .45 .My goal was to purchase as few suppressors as possible while maximizing my weapons coverage .To accomplish this , I ordered a .22 Silencerco Sparrow , a .45 AAC TiRANT , and a Thunderbeast 30P-1 .My Sparrow will handle my .22 Sig pistol along with my Ruger 10/22 and Sig Sauer 522 .The TiRANT will work with my H&K USP Tactical and by purchasing an additional piston , should be able to work on my 9 mm Sig P229 .I do n't currently plan to suppress my .357Sig or .4 , so I can safely skip those .And if I decide to do it down the road , the TiRANT should be able to handle those as well .One thing to note is that you 'll need a threaded barrel to mount a suppressor , so unless your gun came with one , plan to add that cost to the overall price tag .One advantage of the AAC TiRANT is that I can disassemble it for cleaning .Not all suppressors can be disassembled by users and , with the exception of .22 suppressors , arguably , most do n't need to be , but it 's nice to have the option .Rifle suppressors rarely , if ever can be disassembled by users because of the safety issues related to the pressures rifle cartridges generate .I chose the Thunderbeast 30P-1 because I want a suppressor for my .300Winchester Magnum rifle and the 30P-1 is rated for magnum loads .I 'll also be able to use it on my SIG SAUER 716 , my AAC 300 Blackout upper , and with the purchase of an adapter , my SIG 516 .I had originally considered going with AAC 's 300-TM , but it still has n't been released by AAC .And given the fact that I 'll be waiting six to seven months for my tax stamp , I did n't want to wait any longer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.32625"}

{"text": "Experimentation has also shown that hot suppressors perform differently from cold ones .The greatest freebore boost comes from hot ones , which stands to reason since a cold suppressor is stealing heat from the propellant gases and slowing their rate of expansion .Interestingly , a hot suppressor also tends to produce the most variance in the degree of freebore boost , making velocity less predictable .You can probably guess what that does for a consistent POI .So we 've got a lot of little effects generated by suppressors .What do they add up to ?By now you might be able to guess that generally speaking , a suppressor is n't going to negatively affect the ballistics of a round .What it is going to do is shift the point of impact for a weapon that has been zeroed to the shooter without a suppressor .The effect is much more pronounced at longer ranges ; at short range you 're typically looking at half a minute of angle ( MOA ) or less , which wo n't exactly jeopardize your chances of hitting your target .But if you 're talking the ranges typical of long guns , you 've got to account for the difference .You can get reasonably consistent POIs with a suppressor , but they wo n't be the same ones you shoot without it .The ideal solution is to have optics that can be switched between two zeroes ; a more practical one is to have a second dope table for shooting with the suppressor so that you can dial in adjustments appropriately .So with short - range engagements - CQB in particular - the suppressor is n't going to make enough difference to matter .Not to complicate matters after all that , I have to add that ammo choice can play a huge role .That crack can be eliminated with the use of subsonic ammunition .Even the cycling of the action makes noise .( In many cases subsonic rounds will solve that problem , too , as they do not produce enough gas pressure to cycle the bolt . )Of course , if you 're shooting a target 400 meters away with a long gun , the clack of the bolt probably is n't a big concern for you , compared to shooting from five meters away with a pistol .So while I certainly do n't want to insult anyone 's intelligence , I 'm obliged to point out that such rounds will have significantly different ballistics than standard loads .Suppressors have legitimate tactical uses , and you need not worry about wrecking your accuracy by using one .Just remember two key factors - the difference is no big deal at short range but matters at long range , and your weapon has two different zeroes with and without a suppressor - and you 'll do fine .In parting , I have to leave you with my very favorite rationalization of why suppressors improve accuracy , courtesy of a guy posting on a firearms optics forum : . \" Suppressors look cool , chicks like cool , and no one wants to blow a shot when a hot chick is checking out their suppressed gun , so you tend to not blow shots so much .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.81255"}

{"text": "The most thorough article on the 1986 Act , of which the silencer provision was one small part , does not even mention the silencer provision ( Hardy , 1986:585 ) .However , looking at the congressional hearings held on the bill , it is clear that the silencer rovision was a reaction to the murder of a Jewish talk - show host by white - supremacists .Alan Bergwas a well - known radio personality in Denver , whose outspoken criticism of hate groups resulted in his murder in June of 1984 .He was ambushed outside his home and riddled with bullets from a .45 caliber sub - machine gun .The murder was widely publicized and resulted in a book being written about it ( Singular , 1987 ) .It was assumed that the silencer had been used in the attack , because silencers were found in the same place as the apparent murder weapon .Witnesses testifying before the Judiciary Committee called attention to this possession of a silencer by the prime suspect .Sam Rabinove , Legal Director of the American Jewish Committee told the House Judiciary Committee : .In each of these articles , there is always the mention of a silencer , or a 9 mm handgun ( U.S. Congress , 1986a:142 ) .It turned out that Yarbrough was not involved in the murder .In 1987 ( long after the silencer provision had been adopted ) , two other members of the neo - nazi group were convicted of the murder and given 150-year prison sentences ( \" 150-Year Sentences Given to Two Killers of Radio Show Host , \" 1987 ) .There is no evidence that a silencer was used .The murder was reported by neighbors who heard gunshots , making the silencer theory unlikely ( Singular , 1987:19 - 20 ) .In any event , a number of witnesses assured the House Committee that machine guns and silencers were \" basic tools of racketeers , drug traffickers and professional killers \" ( Statement of American Academy of Pediatrics , U.S. Congress , 1986a:167 ) .There was no statistical evidence cited as to the incidence of silencers in crime .The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms was asked to provide information on the incidence of machine guns in crime , but no one bothered to ask for any such data about silencers ( U.S. Congress , 1986a:221 ; see also Hardy , 1986:673).7 .Unfortunately , that is all the legislative record contains as far as silencers are concerned .Silencers were declared to be the tools of professional killers with no legitimate purpose .There are a number of other reasons one might advance for the silencer provisions which do not seem to have been considered .One might think that silencers are inherently more dangerous than other firearms .At least one court has declared that it is the dangerous nature of silencers which lead to their control ( U. S. v. Dunlap , 209 F.3d 472 , 478 ( 6th Cir .Yet there is nothing in the legislative record to indicate the inherent danger of silencers was an issue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.51301"}

{"text": "I 'm getting one of these made around a 45 caliber upper- and it requires a fairly enormous suppressor .With something quieter like a striker fired bolt action , you can get it down to maybe 115 or so .With something supersonic or something with a pistol sized can , you can forget about anything significantly below 130db .It really does nt do anything more than protect your hearing .Guns are just too damn loud in real life- the completely silent gun is something out of the movies .The De Lisle carbine or De Lisle Commando carbine was a specialist British rifle used during World War II .The designer was William De Lisle .It was based on a Lee - Enfield Mk 3 rifle converted to .45 ACP ( a pistol cartridge ) , using magazines from the M1911 pistol .The primary feature of the De Lisle was its very effective suppressor which made it very quiet in action - indeed working the bolt to chamber the next round makes a louder noise than firing a round .The De Lisle carbine was used by British commandos and special forces , and was accurate to 250 metres .The De Lisle was made in very limited numbers ; about 130 were produced during the period of 1942 to 1945 .Thompson submachine gun barrels were modified to provide the .45 caliber barrel , which was ported to provide a slow release of high pressure gas .This large volume was one of the keys to the effectiveness of the suppressor .The Lee - Enfield bolt was modified to feed the .45 ACP rounds , and the Lee - Enfield 's magazine assembly was replaced with a new assembly that held a M1911 magazine in place .The De Lisle is known to have seen service during the Malayan Emergency , and it is thought that there may still be small numbers in service for military situations requiring a silenced weapon .Seems there 's someone right here on THR who owns one of these .Reportedly , all one can hear is the firing pin hitting the primer .I want one ... :) .And yes , I know the 250 meter claim is kinda over the top ... but quiet , they are .That article was written by someone that has never owned one or fired one .They do make noise , and the projectile striking the target makes noise as well .Compare to bolt action 22 's with big cans and quadruple the aperature for the bullet and you can imagine they are nt completley silent by any stretch of the imagination .SRT has been making a ton of rifles very close to the Delisle for years ( but with more advanced baffles ) and they rarely go far below 120 db .And despite all this , the delisle is pretty much the apex of what you can accomplish- like I said in my article about striker - fired bolt actions using subsonic ammo .Criminals today can tape a 2L soda bottle full of foam peanuts over the barrel of a gun and accomplish essentially the same thing as a suppressor , but few ever bother to do this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.979164"}
