{"text": "Obama has staked the credibility of the United States - and his presidency - on his call for a military operation to punish the Syrian government for its alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians last month .But the president faces hardening barriers in Congress , where both Republican critics and Democratic allies have voiced deep reservations or flat opposition to his proposal to intervene militarily in a predominantly Muslim nation after a decade of war overseas .Polls show that much of the American public is skeptical , too .The urgency partly reflects the surprising way that Obama culminated days of deliberation over how to respond to President Bashar al - Assad 's alleged use of chemical weapons , which Obama called \" an assault on human dignity \" that can not go unpunished .He announced Saturday that he would seek congressional approval for any military strike against the Syrian government , and he has struggled to rally support across party lines amid his previously scheduled trip to Sweden and Russia .As of Sept. 4 , lawmakers appear to be tentatively dividing into four camps over military action in Syria .The White House lobbying effort has included direct conversations between Obama or top administration officials and at least 60 senators and at least 125 House members as of Thursday , according to a White House official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration operations .Late Thursday afternoon , Vice President Biden and Antony Blinken , the deputy national security adviser , briefed a bipartisan group of House and Senate members in the White House Situation Room , an administration official said .The outcome of a congressional vote , especially in the Republican\u00adled House , is unclear , and the issue has blurred traditional party lines .White House officials said they are not concerned about the vote trend in Congress so far .They said Obama , who is to return to Washington late Friday , will begin a more public campaign , including perhaps a presidential address , to win support from Congress and the American public for a strike .The full Senate plans to begin considering as early as Friday a resolution authorizing the use of force after a divided Foreign Relations Committee this week backed limited military action .Majority Leader Harry M. Reid ( D - Nev . ) is \" guardedly optimistic \" that the resolution can pass , according to Senate aides .But Sen. Joe Manchin III ( W.Va . ) , a moderate Democrat who has been a bipartisan consensus-\u00adbuilder , said Thursday that a military strike \" would be the wrong course of action \" before all diplomatic options are exhausted .Here in St. Petersburg , Obama 's quandary over Syria - and his estrangement from the summit 's host and Syria 's key patron , Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin - largely overshadowed the economic agenda of the Group of 20 meeting .Obama used the gathering to privately press his G-20 colleagues to support a U.S.-led strike in words , if not resources .He found one possible ally in Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , who Obama said agrees that the Syrian attack should not go unpunished .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "25.850317"}

{"text": "The president and his national security team have apparently already concluded that intervention in Syria serves America 's interests , and appear determined to act accordingly .Chemical weapons merely provide a justification to assert those interests , among which are to ensure access to oil and to help allies , especially Israel , in the Middle East .Moreover , the intervention has a global and regional component : the administration is warning the Russian Federation and China that the United States will defend its interests in the Middle East , with military force if necessary .As for Iran , it is a warning that the United States is determined to reduce Iranian influence in the region , sending a signal that Washington has the will and capability to retaliate if Iran decides to develop nuclear weapons .What are the facts of the case ?Obama has concluded \" that the Syrian government , in fact , carried out \" a chemical attack on civilians , and that we need to send \" a pretty strong signal that they better not do it again .\" Secretary of State John Kerry claimed that the White House has overwhelming evidence and \" high confidence \" that the government of Syria used chemical weapons , and released a declassified intelligence dossier to back up these charges .But the United States does not in fact have ironclad proof that Assad used chemical weapons in August .To be sure , the UN envoy has suggested that some chemical substance was used but has not released any definitive findings about the culprit .While it 's likely that Assad is guilty , it is also conceivable that a rogue military unit or a segment of the rebel opposition could be the culprit .Many well - meaning people believe the United States must intervene on humanitarian grounds in order to stop Assad from using chemical weapons on his people again .But while protecting civilians and preventing future tragedies is vital , there are strong reasons not to trust the motivations of the people pushing this war , or the likely outcomes of the proposed military intervention .History provides important lessons in this regard .The supposed weapons of mass destruction ( \" WMD \" ) in Iraq green - lighted the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 , leading to years of war and almost innumerable deaths .The Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964 led to a lengthy U.S. ground war in Vietnam .Pursuing U.S. \" interests \" led to the 1953 overthrow of the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh in Iran .During the Iran - Iraq war in the 1980s , the United States secretly gave arms to Iran ( part of the Iran - Contra affair ) while providing intelligence to Iraq on the location of Iranian troops , knowing full well Saddam Hussein would use his chemical weapons against them .This track record should inspire little confidence among actual humanitarians .The Obama administration has emphasized that any attack on Syria would be a \" limited \" intervention that would not involve \" boots on the ground \" or lead to a wider war .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "38.781166"}

How was the strike launched ? A. The Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from four ships in the Caspian Sea and flew across Iran and northern Iraq to reach their targets .Russia has maintained a naval flotilla in the Caspian - which is landlocked from the rest of the world 's seas - for nearly 300 years .The flotilla currently has no aircraft carriers or other large capital ships , but it has frigates and Buyan - class missile corvettes , including two that were commissioned just last year , the Grad Sviyazhsk and the Veliky Ustyug .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.72243"}

{"text": "Media caption The BBC 's Emily Thomas : \" Scene of horror in the rebel - held suburbs \" .UN officials say alleged chemical weapons attacks which Syria 's opposition says killed hundreds near Damascus were a \" serious escalation \" .Deputy Secretary - General Jan Eliasson made the comments after briefing an emergency UN Security Council meeting about Wednesday 's incident .The Security Council also said that clarity was needed over the attacks .Some 35 member states called for UN weapons inspectors already in Syria to be dispatched immediately to the scene .Opposition activists said that more than 1,000 people were killed after government forces launched rockets with toxic agents into the Damascus suburbs in the Ghouta region early on Wednesday .Analysis .The chances of the UN chemical weapons inspectors in Syria accessing the true site of Wednesday 's alleged chemical attack in time to make a clear judgement on responsibility are slim .It took months to negotiate permission for them to visit other sites around the country and the Syrian government , backed by Russia , is resisting calls to give them access to the eastern Damascus suburb of Ghouta where this apparent atrocity took place .Part of the reason is the area is contested between government forces and rebels and is therefore unsafe .If an agent such as sarin has been used , the UN team would need to get to the site within days before traces become so faint as to be inconclusive .And if , as the opposition claims , it was a government attack , then a delay of days or weeks would give it enough time for forensic evidence to become controversial and for evidence of munitions used to be removed .The Syrian government insists it was the rebels who carried out the attack .The Syrian government has denied the allegations , describing them as \" illogical and fabricated \" .The Syrian army said the opposition made up the claims to divert attention from the huge losses its forces had suffered recently .The BBC has been unable to independently confirm the death toll .Calls for clarity .\" There must be clarity on what happened and the situation must be followed closely , \" Argentina 's UN ambassador and current Security Council president , Maria Cristina Perceval , said after a closed - door meeting on Wednesday evening .Council members also \" welcomed the determination of the Secretary - General ( Ban Ki - moon ) to ensure a thorough , impartial and prompt investigation \" , she added .Mr Eliasson , who also spoke to reporters after the meeting , said any investigation into the incident would require the consent of the Syrian government and was dependent on the security situation .This followed calls by some 35 member states - including the US , UK and France - for the UN chemical weapons inspectors that are already probing three sites of alleged chemical weapons use in Syria to be dispatched immediately to the scene to investigate .The inspectors arrived in Damascus on Sunday with a mandate to investigate three locations including the northern town of Khan al - Assal , where some 26 people were killed in March .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.22778"}

Susan Collins in 1996 and again in 2002 for a variety of reasons .And independents and Democrats voted for her on that basis .But today , five - and - a - half years after Collins ' 2002 victory , that justification seems exceedingly thin .Because voters who counted on Collins to be a force for moderation and an agent of common sense have little to show for their investment .Whether it 's the war in Iraq -- which Collins backed from the beginning and continues to support -- the torture bill or the Alito nomination , Collins did n't just fail to stop the disastrous , immoderate drift of national policy .She accelerated its progress .Of course Collins would be the first to tell you that she has qualms about the Iraq war ; that she opposes huge deficits ; and that she thinks the President 's inaction on global warming is a shame .But nearly every time she 's had an opportunity to act on these beliefs , she 's swallowed hard and voted with her Republican colleagues .And by being a loyal supporter of the President , she 's helped ease the country 's path toward disrepute , lawlessness and fiscal ruin .To frame a senatorial election as one that pits a centrist vs. a partisan , you have to have a centrist in the race .And Collins ' centrist credentials , like those of Sen.

{"text": "Democrats ' Edge in Party Identification and Leaning Shrinks .Although independents claim no outright allegiance to either major party , it is well - known that they are not necessarily neutral when it comes to politics .When pressed , most independents will say they lean to one of the two major parties .For example , last year an average of 17 % of Americans who initially identified as independents subsequently said they \" leaned \" Republican , 15 % were independents who leaned Democratic , with the remaining 11 % not expressing a leaning to either party .In 2014 , an average 45 % of Americans identified as Democrats or said they were Democratic - leaning independents , while 42 % identified as Republicans or were Republican - leaning independents .That the three - point Democratic edge was down from six points in 2013 , and among Democrats ' smaller advantages the past 25 years .Democrats usually hold an advantage in this combined measure of party affiliation .In fact , the only year Republicans held a notable edge since Gallup began tracking independents ' political leanings was in 1991 , the year Republican President George H.W.
