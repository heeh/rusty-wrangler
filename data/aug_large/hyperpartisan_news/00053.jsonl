Bush at a comparable point in his presidency .He said : . \"Today the Senate will consider the 10th judicial nomination this year . . . .At this point in 2005 , and that was the beginning of President Bush 's second term , comparable for what we 're talking about for President Obama , the Senate had confirmed zero judicial nominees .Let me repeat , at this point in 2005 , the Senate had confirmed not 10 , not 4 , not even 1 judicial nominee , so that comes out to be zero .We just today confirmed the 10th judicial nomination of President Obama 's second term .Today .The 10th judicial nomination of President Obama 's second term .At this point in President Bush 's second term , he got zero judges .None .Ten confirmations compared with zero confirmations sounds bad .But 202 confirmations compared with 181 confirmations sounds even worse - and that 's the actual number of Bush and Obama confirmations at a comparable point in their presidencies .That comes out to 21 fewer confirmations for Obama .Grassley and McConnell 's larger point about fairness would be even stronger if the Senate had confirmed 96 % of President Obama 's district court nominees - the percentage of President Bush 's district court nominees who had been confirmed at a comparable point .Instead , the Senate 's confirmed only 85 % of President Obama 's nominees .Had Grassley , McConnell , and their colleagues allowed Obama to match Bush 's record on this front , the Senate would have confirmed another 19 judges , making the two presidents ' overall confirmation numbers almost exactly even .As it happens , there are exactly 19 district court nominees pending in the Senate right now .Unfortunately , Republicans have delayed the 13 nominees on the Senate floor , who have been waiting for over a month , and 6 nominees who are pending in committee .Given the Senators ' evident concern with fairness , you would think that they would at least allow immediate votes for the 13 nominees pending on the floor , all but one of whom were reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "39.775173"}

{"text": "\" The problem here is that simply comparing confirmation totals from an isolated 15 month period is hardly an adequate proxy for each president 's ability to fill vacancies and move nominees through the confirmation process .As an initial matter , the overall number of confirmations for Obama and Bush at this point in their presidencies is about the same - Obama has now appointed 235 federal judges , while Bush had appointed 233 .Taking the full picture into account , Slattery 's \" 2-to-1 \" ratio is plainly arbitrary and incomplete .Next , in any event , comparing the total number of confirmations is meaningless without also considering the number of vacancies each president could possibly fill , and the number of nominees the Senate could possibly confirm .Here , Obama has had 35 more total vacancies thus far in his presidency than Bush , and he 's also made 38 more nominations .That alone suggests that , all else being equal or more favorable to President Obama , he should have a much higher number of confirmations than President Bush .Moreover , Obama 's judicial confirmations have not kept pace with new vacancies .During his administration , the number of vacancies has increased by 30-from 55 to the current total of 85 .Conversely , the confirmations of President Bush 's judicial nominees reduced the total number of vacancies by 27-from 80 when he took office , to 53 on April 1 , 2006 .By these measures , which account for essential variables that the Heritage Foundation ignored , Bush fared significantly better in getting his nominees confirmed and staffing the federal judiciary .Finally , Slattery 's analysis ignores the ways in which Republican obstruction contributes to Obama 's growing number of vacancies and relatively low confirmation rate .All of these nominees could be confirmed quickly through unanimous consent or agreed - upon votes , the traditional means of confirming judges .But Senate Republicans have slowed the process by requiring a cloture vote on even the most noncontroversial nominees .For example , a trio of district court judges recently confirmed to the Eastern District of Michigan all failed to earn the 60 votes that Senate rules used to require to invoke cloture .They were then confirmed 98 - 0 , 98 - 0 , and 97 - 0 , respectively , revealing that the demand for cloture votes was merely a charade intended only to waste time .Similarly , Tenth Circuit nominee Carolyn McHugh suffered through a meaningless 62 - 34 cloture vote despite having the home state support of Utah 's two Republican Senators .She was confirmed 98 - 0 .Vacancies also remain high because Republican Senators delay in recommending nominees for seats in their home states .As a result , 31 of the 37 current vacancies without a nominee are in a state with at least one Republican Senator , and 8 of those 31 are critical \" judicial emergencies .\"Regardless of how many confirmations the Senate records , Americans in these states will be denied justice as they wait for overburdened and understaffed courts to catch up with rising caseloads .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "44.448036"}

Circuit confirmed over the course of his eight years in office .So far , President Obama has had only one confirmed .More importantly , though , calling what the President is doing here \" court packing \" completely ignores what that practice actually is .Historically , the best known example of \" court packing , \" of course , dates to the Franklin Roosevelt Administration when Roosevelt , frustrated by the Supreme Court striking down several key elements of the New Deal as unconstitutional .Essentially , FDR 's plan would have given the President the right to appoint a new Justice for every Justice that did n't retire within six months after turning 70 .The reaction to FDR 's proposal was swift and negative .Powerful members of his own party came out in opposition to it , and it eventually became clear that it would never be able to pass Congress despite the fact that the Democratic Party had a huge majority in both Houses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.57608"}

Bush appointee Arthur Schwab - the ruling comes as no surprise .Paul Gordon of People for the American Way has already explained how Judge Schwab 's opinion betrays his ideological opposition to the president 's executive order .For example , Judge Schwab reached to declare the new policy unconstitutional without first deciding whether the policy even applies to the defendant in this case .But while Judge Schwab 's opinion is troubling , it is n't the first time his political views have trumped his duty to be an impartial judge .In 2005 , famed forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht had a public feud with Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala over Zappala 's failure to investigate or prosecute white police officers who had allegedly killed black citizens .Soon after , Wecht was indicted on public corruption charges that many believed to be politically motivated .Judge Schwab was assigned to the case , and made a number of unorthodox rulings against Wecht .In one instance , he prohibited Wecht from making nearly any objection to the government 's 240,000 pages of evidence - including an objection arguing that some of the evidence was illegally seized .In another ruling , Schwab kept the names of the jurors under seal .The first trial resulted in a hung jury .On appeal , the Third Circuit called Schwab 's rulings \" inappropriate , \" \" troublesome , \" and \" strange and unsettling , \" and took the unusual step of removing him from the case .Prosecutors decided not to retry the case .More recently , Judge Schwab wrote an opinion that criticized the National Labor Relations Board for serving as the \" litigation arm of the [ Service Employees International Union]. \"Given Schwab 's history of playing political favorites , it is no surprise that , when the Allegheny County Bar Association conducts its annual judicial survey , Judge Schwab consistently ranks dead last among state and federal judges in both temperament and impartiality .Faced with Judge Schwab 's latest ruling , the Third Circuit should once again reverse , ensuring that President Obama 's executive order continues to protect millions of American children and families .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.585567"}

Bush 's score when it comes to judicial appointments , \" and notes that Obama \" seems likely to break Bush 's mark with help from a Republican - controlled Senate . \" The sole basis of these claims is that Obama is 11 judicial appointments short of matching Bush 's total for his entire eight years .Setting aside that this historically awful Republican majority is barely on pace to confirm 11 more judges this entire Congress , the article demonstrates the absurdity and uselessness of fixating on confirmation totals in isolation .Over the weekend , Eastern District of Texas Judge Michael Schneider announced that he 'll leave active duty and take \" senior status \" in January 2016 .By providing over four - months ' notice , Judge Schneider gave the Texas senators charged with finding his replacement an opportunity to do what they have never done before : fill a judicial vacancy before the judge actually steps down and further weakens an already strained justice system .Avoiding the disruption of a vacancy is , after all , the whole point of giving advance notice .In other states , senators often begin working on a vacancy as soon as it 's announced .But not Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz .Instead , they have watched vacancies pile up - ignoring , in some cases , more than a year of notice .They have refused to take action until a judge has left the bench , or even long afterward .Nine Texas federal district judges have stepped down while Cornyn and Cruz have been in office .In each case the judge left before the senators even asked candidates to submit applications .That slow - motion process is contrary not just to common practice nationwide , but to the precedent John Cornyn himself established when fellow - Republican George W. Bush was in office .When Cornyn and Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison served in the Senate under President Bush , five Texas judges gave advance notice of their departure , and for all five the senators recommended replacements well before the vacancies became current .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.135216"}

Rubio 's reversal effectively vetoes the nomination .As a result , this judgeship , already vacant for more than 18 months , will remain vacant still longer , causing unconscionable delays for residents of Miami - Dade , Broward , Palm Beach and several other South Florida counties seeking justice in federal court .The only thing that 's changed is Rubio 's need to shore up his far - right base after flirting with compromise on immigration reform .Apparently , Rubio did n't want to further alienate his extremist allies by supporting a highly - qualified judge who would also happen to be the first openly gay black male judge to serve on the federal bench .As much as I would like to think that politics has nothing to do with this , it looks as if it does .It would be unfair to prevent a well - qualified judicial nominee from proceeding with the nomination process because he is an openly gay black male .But given Rubio 's feeble and illogical excuses for his reversal , that appears to be exactly what 's happened .Rubio cites two rulings by Thomas .In the first , Thomas had to throw out a confession in a horrific rape and murder case because two of the five defendants either had not been read their Miranda rights , or did not understand them .Nonetheless , all five were convicted or pled guilty - and Judge Thomas sentenced one of the killers to death .In the second case , Rubio felt that Thomas had not imposed a sufficiently harsh sentence on a driver who killed a cyclist .But Rubio has the complex facts of the case wrong .In January of this year , the prosecutor who handled the case set the record straight in a letter to Rubio , saying that Judge Thomas made his sentencing determination - which was within the guidelines provided by law - using \" careful judgment . \"In July , the Administrative Judge for the court where Thomas serves did the same .Rubio ignored both letters .To make matters worse , these are exactly the sorts of questions that are best hashed out in the sunlight of a public committee hearing .But without Rubio 's consent , Judge Thomas will never have that opportunity .The big losers in all this are the people of South Florida .When federal courts do n't have enough judges , delays can become unbearable .Medical bills caused by injuries due to negligence may pile up while families wait for justice ; memories may fade ; witnesses may die .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.526875"}

Cruz stands behind what he said \" in Politico and that \" holding nominations is a constitutional power given to Senate leadership and it is up to leadership to exercise that power .\" The problem is that while the Constitution empowers the full Senate to provide \" Advice and Consent \" on nominations , it makes no mention of Senate leadership , nor does it confer power to \" hold [ ] nominations \" on any individual senator - majority leader or otherwise .And there is no basis to claim that advice and consent exists \" explicitly \" to deter the president from issuing executive orders completely unrelated to judicial nominations .There is no question that Senate Republicans have several means of obstructing the president 's nominees if they so choose ; that was true even before they became the majority .But it 's misleading at best to give mere partisan obstruction and political gamesmanship the imprimatur of the Constitution .Ted Cruz knows better , and we think the American people do too .A little over a week into the new Congress , and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa , has already begun laying the groundwork to limit the number of President Obama 's judicial nominees the Senate will confirm .As we detailed earlier this week , presidents have historically continued filling judicial vacancies even with an opposition Senate in their final two years of office .On average , 20 percent of a president 's total judicial confirmations - which would be 76 judges for President Obama - are confirmed in the final two years of office .The Senate has not yet confirmed any nominees this year .Nonetheless , in a recent article , a Grassley spokeswoman said that the Senator has already started tallying his confirmations for the 114 th Congress , presumably to limit the number of additional nominees the Senate will confirm .Under Grassley 's version of new math , the current Senate has already confirmed 11 judges .Grassley counts these judges even though they were reported out of committee and confirmed not in the current Senate , the one in which Republicans are in the majority , but by the last Senate during its \" lame duck \" session .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.018875"}

'Nearly two - thirds of Americans do not like Obamacare .In 2010 , the main issue in the mid - term elections was Obamacare : more than 50 Democrats lost their seats and Republicans scored their biggest mid - term victory for over half a century .It was probably for the best that the Supreme Court did not overturn a law crafted by a democratically - elected president and passed by Congress .As Roberts made clear , he was viewing the matter legally , not politically - whether Obamacare is good policy is a matter for the voters .In the hours after the decision , Romney raised some $ 2 million .Opposition to Obamacare , like almost nothing else , unites and energises Republicans .Romney , with his Massachusetts baggage , is an imperfect messenger on healthcare .But the Roberts tax argument plays right into his hands by linking Obamacare to the economy .In a time of economic hardship with rising unemployment why did Obama raise taxes to achieve the Left 's dream of universal healthcare ?That 's a potent question for Romney to ask in the final four months of this campaign .The decision deprives the Left in a single stroke of its argument that Obama needs to be re - elected so he can appoint liberal judges to a Supreme Court controlled by Right - wing zealots .It also gives Romney a very clear message of ' repeal and replace ' .A striking down of Obamacare would have been a distaster for Obama .But in the longer - term , his victory might well prove to be a Pyrrhic one .Some conservatives are already calling Obama 's healthcare reform ' Obamatax ' rather than ' Obamacare ' .If Romney adopts that description , he makes the reform sound altogether less benign and he links the healthcare debate to his core message about the economy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.13883"}

Circuit broke with decades of precedent and decisions from every other circuit to rule on the issue to invalidate those appointments .The decision being appealed now , discussed in detail in this previous post to Justice Watch , left the entire NLRB in limbo .That post also discusses the fact that this kind of extreme activism is nothing new for the conservatives on the D.C.
