Sparks , an officer called in the license plate of a GMC Suburban to request a computerized check .The dispatcher mistyped the information given by the officer and informed him that the plate was registered to a 1983 Chevy CTX .The dispatcher subsequently informed the officer of the error and that the correct registration information revealed it had expired one month earlier .After receiving the information , the officer initiated a traffic stop .Upon questioning the driver , the officer located a stolen motorcycle plate , amphetamine , a loaded .45-caliber gun and a black ski mask .This information also led to the officer obtaining a search warrant for the vehicle , which revealed additional weapons and drugs .The driver filed a motion to suppress the evidence , arguing the traffic stop was based on the computerized check on the wrong license plate .However , the court found that the driver failed to point to any evidence that the officer lacked good faith .Moreover , even assuming the officer did not possess good faith , the court found that the dispatcher , once she revealed her error , told the officer the Suburban s correct license plate was expired by one month .This is probable cause to stop the vehicle .Even without the additional probable cause as in Sparks , if an officer acts in good faith , the evidence may not be suppressed .In Walraven , the dispatcher gave the officer conducting the traffic stop information on a different license plate ( she inverted the last two numbers of the license plate ) and gave him this information on three separate occasions in a 3.5 minute period .The Walraven court further found that because the officer was concentrating on the Cadillac , he did not hear the dispatcher incorrectly repeat the license plate information .Moreover , evidence that the officer was concentrating on the road was also presented .Randomly checking license plates also applies to vehicles that are stationary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.9519"}

Walraven , an Albany County , Wyo . , deputy sheriff observed two men driving a 1983 brown Cadillac bearing a Tennessee license plate .The deputy routinely ran the license plates on out - of - state vehicles .After asking his dispatcher to do a computerized check on the Cadillac s vehicle registration , the deputy was informed that the plate number belonged to a 1988 Toyota .The deputy decided to stop the Cadillac on that information alone .After stopping the vehicle and engaging the occupants in a conversation relating to the purpose of the traffic stop , the deputy located a bag containing 2 kilos of cocaine .The deputy arrested both occupants .The owner of the vehicle ( who was the passenger at the time of the traffic stop ) appealed the district court s denial of his motion to suppress the evidence of the cocaine , alleging the deputy obtained the contraband in violation of the Fourth Amendment .Specifically , the owner challenged the constitutionality of the deputy s registration check of his vehicle .The appellate court s analysis of the deputy s method in establishing reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle was succinct .In short , it held that because license plates are in plain view , no privacy interest exists in the license plates .Incorrect Plate Information What if an officer runs a computer check of a license plate and mistypes or misstates one of the license plate characters ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.720924"}

{"text": "Such requirements are designed to facilitate the identification of vehicle owners and the investigation of accidents , thefts , traffic violations and other violations of law .Commonly , if not universally , the statutes imposing the requirements of registration or licensing also prescribe fees which must be paid to authorize state officials to issue the necessary documents and plates .The serviceman who has not registered his car and obtained license plates under the laws ' of ' his home State , whatever the reason , may be required by the host State to register and license the car under its laws .The proviso is to be read , at the least , as assuring that \u00a7 514 would not have the effect of permitting servicemen to escape the obligation of registering and licensing their motor vehicles .We conclude , however , that no such purpose is revealed in the section or its legislative history and that its intent is limited to the purpose of assuring registration .Since at least the 2 % tax here involved has been held not essential to that purpose as a matter of state law , we affirm the California Supreme Court 's judgment .It is plain at the outset that California may collect the 2 % tax only if it is a ' license , fee , or excise ' on a motor vehicle or its use .The very purpose of \u00a7 514 in broadly freeing the nonresident serviceman from the obligation to pay property and income taxes was to relieve him of the burden of supporting the governments of the States where he was present solely in compliance with military orders .The statute operates whether or not the home State imposes or assesses such taxes against him .As we said in Dameron v. Brodhead , 345 U.S. 322 , 326 , 73 S.Ct .721 , 724 , 97 L.Ed .It saved the sole right of taxation to the state of original residence whether or not that state exercised the right .

State of Minnesota , 283 U.S. 57 , 62 , 51 S.Ct .354 , 355 , 75 L.Ed .While it is true that a few state taxes in effect in 1944 , like the California 2 % ' license fee , ' were imposed solely for revenue purposes , the great majority of state taxes also served to enforce registration and licensing statutes . 8 No discussion of existing state laws appears in the Committee Reports .There is thus no indication that Congress was aware that any State required that servicemen contribute to the costs of highway maintenance without regard to the relevance of such requirements to the nonrevenue purposes of state motor vehicle laws .The conclusion that Congress lacked information about the California practice does not preclude a determination that it meant to include such taxes , levied only for revenue , as ' licenses , fees , or excises .

{"text": "The authors suggested several strategies : .Develop collaboratives in which law enforcement shares information with adult protective services , financial institutions , public guardians , and prosecutors both at the state and federal levels .In other types of financial crimes , law enforcement should be sensitive to the immediate financial and psychological needs of victims as a result of the impact of such crimes , and in some cases , susceptibility to future scams as a way of recouping what has been stolen .It is important for victim advocates to help law enforcement find appropriate referrals to provide to such victims .IMPORTANCE OF VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS AND RESTITUTION .Restitution is one of the primary factors affecting the satisfaction of victims within the criminal justice system ( OVC 1998 ) .It is essential that prosecutors , probation officers , victims , victim service professionals , and the judiciary all work together to secure the right to restitution for victims of financial crime .As discussed earlier in this chapter , significant legislative progress has been made in securing this right on both the federal and the state levels .However , there are exceptions to the ordering of restitution , as described above , and the existence of appropriate laws does not always translate into actual enforcement of their provisions .The following are others issues that may prevent victims from receiving restitution : .Judgments not listing the victim 's name and loss , thus making it unenforceable as an order , or for other purposes in which a victim may need his or her name listed on a judgment .Prosecutors may not feel that it is necessary to include all victims , feeling that victims have the option of civil recovery for their losses .However , by the time a case has been fully investigated and accepted by the prosecution , several years may have gone by , and civil recovery may be precluded because the applicable statute of limitation has expired .Even more crucial , most victims have losses that make it difficult to hire an attorney , especially if a defendant appears to have few assets .The underlying individual victim , who may have incurred many costs in trying to clear damaged credit records or restore bank accounts , may not be seen as a victim entitled to restitution .In cases of elder financial abuse or exploitation and in many investment and telemarketing cases , the elderly victim may not live long enough to see any restitution even whereordered .Information provided by victim advocates should include provisions on how restitution is distributed to a deceased victim 's estate .Also , even in cases where a victim is awarded restitution , many are not informed enough about the criminal justice system process to understand that an order does not necessarily mean that they will be paid in the near future .Some victims may believe that if restitution is ordered , the defendant will be mailing them a check for their entire loss a week after sentencing .Victim advocates should ensure that a detailed explanation of the restitution process after it has been ordered is a part of the information and brochures available to all victims for whom restitution is ordered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.50155"}

Minnesota , 283 U.S. 57 , 62 .While it is true that a few state taxes in effect in 1944 , like the California 2 % \" license fee , \" were imposed solely for revenue purposes , the great majority of state taxes also served to enforce registration and licensing statutes . 8 No discussion of existing state laws appears in the Committee Reports .There is thus no indication that Congress was aware that any State required that servicemen contribute to the costs of highway maintenance without regard to the relevance of such requirements to the nonrevenue purposes of state motor vehicle laws .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.587555"}

{"text": "The conclusion that Congress lacked information about the California practice does not preclude a determination that it meant to include such taxes , levied only for revenue , as \" licenses , fees , or excises .\" But in deciding that question in the absence of affirmative indication of congressional meaning , we must consider the overall purpose of 514 as well as the words of subsection ( 2 ) ( b ) .Taxes like the California 2 % \" license fee \" serve primarily a revenue interest , narrower in purpose but no different in kind from taxes raised to defray the general expenses of government .9 It is from the burden of taxes serving such ends that nonresident servicemen were to be freed , in the main , without regard to whether their home States imposed or sought to collect such taxes from them .Dameron v. Brodhead , supra .In recent amendments , Congress has reconfirmed this basic purpose .10 We do not think that subsection ( 2 ) ( b ) should be read as impinging upon it .Whether the 2 % tax is within the reach of the federal immunity is thus not to be tested , as California argues , by whether its inclusion frustrates the administration of California 's tax policies .The test , rather , is whether the inclusion would deny the State power to [ 382 U.S. 386 , 396 ] enforce the nonrevenue provisions of state motor vehicle legislation .Whatever may be the case under the registration and licensing statutes of other States , California authorities have made it clear that the California 2 % tax is not imposed as a tax essential to the registration and licensing of the serviceman 's motor vehicle .Buzard v.

{"text": "Although restitution is usually difficult to obtain , it is essential that court orders be pursued vigorously because it is very important to a victim 's financial and psychological recovery .One of the issues involved in obtaining an adequate restitution award is the preparation of a comprehensive and hard - hitting victim impact statement .Detailed accounts of funds stolen in these crimes and documentation of emotional distress are imperative to achieving adequate awards .This is often made difficult because of the large volume of victims involved in financial crime schemes , and the fact that some victims experience difficulty with trust in divulging personal information , even to officials of the criminal justice system .Victim advocates should ensure that victims of financial crimes are provided information about how to complete victim impact and loss information as well as information about the date and time of sentencing .If possible , advocates should offer to assist at trials and sentencings in cases such as elder financial abuse , or other cases in which a prosecutor feels that a victim needs special consideration .The Need for Collaborative Efforts .With the enhancement of VOCA funding to allow services to financial crime victims , victim service professionals will soon have more options for referrals and community collaborative efforts to assist victims of financial crimes .Until that time , advocates need to look within their own communities to address the specific needs and concerns of financial crime victims .As stated in Providing Services to Victims of Fraud : Resources for Victim / Witness Coordinators ( Alexander 1998 ) : .In general , victim / witness coordinators are severely burdened with growing caseloads , a lack of program or administrative staff , and numerous job - related duties .Such constraints leave victim / witness coordinators little time to establish programs and services to meet the growing needs of fraud victims .Cases involving fraud make victim / witness coordinators ' jobs even more difficult , especially when those cases involve thousands of victims .Victim / witness coordinators can employ several effective strategies to enhance their services to fraud victims .Coordinators can network with members of the community and allied professionals to learn of appropriate referrals , and they can establish local or regional task forces to address voices in victim assistance programs and services .Efforts that can identify opportunities for collaboration within the community include : .Obtaining information about the types of financial crimes being reported to federal agents and/or local law enforcement within a community .Victim services providers can talk to local police who investigate crimes such as fraud , identity theft , or financial elder abuse and invite them to address local victim service meetings .Examining state or federal victims ' rights laws to compare those rights provided to victims of violent crimes to those afforded to victims of financial crimes .Where there is a difference , or financial crime victims are ignored , advocates should raise this issue for change by state - wide coalitions .( For example , under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ( 32 ) , victims of violent crimes are permitted to speak about the impact of a crime at sentencing , but the Rule is silent about financial crime victims also having this right . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.79987"}

{"text": "While the philosophies and conspiracy theories can vary from person to person , their core beliefs are the same : The government operates outside of its jurisdiction .Because of this belief , they do not recognize federal , state , or local laws , policies , or regulations .One prevalent sovereign - citizen theory is the Redemption Theory , which claims the U.S. government went bankrupt when it abandoned the gold standard basis for currency in 1933 and began using citizens as collateral in trade agreements with foreign governments .( 2 ) These beliefs can provide a gateway to illegal activity because such individuals believe the U.S. government does not act in the best interests of the American people .By announcing themselves as sovereign citizens , they are emancipated from the responsibilities of being a U.S. citizen , including paying taxes , possessing a state driver 's license , or obeying the law .Illegal Activity .The Redemption Theory belief leads to their most prevalent method to defraud banks , credit institutions , and the U.S. government : the Redemption Scheme .Sovereign citizens believe that when the U.S. government removed itself from the gold standard , it rendered U.S. currency as a valueless credit note , exchanging one credit document ( such as a dollar bill ) for another .They assert that the U.S. government now uses citizens as collateral , issuing social security numbers and birth certificates to register people in trade agreements with other countries .Each citizen has a monetary net worth , which they believe is kept in a U.S. Treasury Direct account , valued from $ 630,000 to more than $ 3 million .These accounts , they claim , are in a third - party 's name , a \" strawman , \" that they can access , which they commonly refer to as \" freeing money from the strawman .\" In essence , it is extorting money from the U.S. Treasury Department .Sovereign citizens file legitimate IRS and Uniform Commercial Code forms for illegitimate purposes , believing that doing so correctly will compel the U.S. Treasury to fulfill its debts , such as credit card debts , taxes , and mortgages .( 3 ) [ ILLUSTRATION OMITTED ] .At a minimum , these activities create a voluminous influx of documents that clog the courts and other government agencies .But , the idea behind the Redemption Theory also leads sovereign citizens to find criminal sources of income as they travel the country , teach fraudulent tactics to others for a fee , and participate in white collar crimes .The latter offenses include mail , bank , mortgage , and wire fraud ; money laundering ; tax violations ; and illegal firearms sales and purchases .At seminars , sovereign citizens charge participants a fee in exchange for information on Redemption Theory schemes and other methods to avoid paying taxes , sometimes even selling materials , such as CDs or DVDs .Several recent incidents highlight their activities .The men sold \" lifetime memberships \" to customers and promised to pay any accident claims against members .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.143875"}

{"text": "There are significant differences depending upon the type of fraud involved , though .For instance , crimes classified as securities and exchange fraud carried an average sentence of just under five years .In state court , the average sentence for fraud was also two years .Embezzlement is a particular form of theft wherein the offender has legal access to , but not legal ownership of , money or property taken .The most common situations in which embezzlement occurs are those in which an employee who has access to the employer 's money or property - or to the money or property of the employer 's clients - diverts some of that money or property for his own use .Embezzlement is distinguished from larceny by the embezzler 's control over the money or property in question .Embezzlement does n't always mean outright theft .Unauthorized borrowing of money or property entrusted to one 's care may also constitute embezzlement .Like fraud , embezzlement covers a broad spectrum of offenses ranging from high - level bank employees skimming hundreds of thousands of dollars from the banks accounts to the waitress who picks up cash left by a customer to pay the check and slips it in her own pocket instead .At the federal level , embezzlement from private businesses or individual clients tends to carry harsher sentences than embezzlement from banks and governmental agencies .At the state level , embezzlement is generally classified with fraud and carries similar penalties .Forgery and counterfeiting refer generally to the copying or alteration of something in order to pass the copy or altered version off as original and authentic .Signing another person 's name to a check or document without that person 's permission is forgery .The creation of false documents may be classified as either forgery or counterfeiting , depending upon the jurisdiction and the specifics .For instance , the creation of a copy of a valuable work of art , complete with the artist 's signature , in an attempt to sell the copy as the original might constitute forgery or counterfeiting or both .Historically , \" forgery \" referred to written instruments , while \" counterfeiting \" applied to the manufacture of works and objects such as money and artwork .At the core of each crime is the effort to create something and pass it off as real or original when it is not : a fake deed to real property , an altered check , and counterfeit currency are some of the most common .Bribery and extortion are both crimes intended to persuade another person to act in a certain way , but the similarity ends there .Bribery attempts to influence the other person 's behavior by offering some benefit , often money , in compensation for that decision .For instance , a business impacted by a certain piece of legislation might offer money , or a campaign contribution , to an official who voted as the company wished .The average bribery conviction in the federal system carried a sentence of 9 to18 months .Extortion , while related to bribery and often occurring in tandem with it , might not even otherwise be classified as a white collar crime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.00517"}

[19 ] .Vehicle registration appears to have originated for two primary reasons .The first is alluded to in the opening lines of the above quote .Registration and license fees were viewed as \" a major source of revenue for highway purposes .Until 1929 , these sources provided the major share of revenue derived from highway users .\" [ 20 ] The second reason was the need to be able to identify vehicles , both for purposes of taxation as well as for identifying those that were operated recklessly or unsafely .[21 ] Flink then adds : .Undoubtedly , the most important reasons for motorists ' objections to numbering ordinances remained covert .Motorists generally feared that the facilitation of identification of their vehicles would increase chances of arrest , fine , imprisonment , and the payment of damage claims .Also , registration helped tax assessors identify and locate automobile owners who were evading payment of personal property taxes on their cars .To cite but one example , it was estimated that in Denver one - third of the automobiles in the city had gone untaxed prior to the adoption of a registration ordinance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.766754"}
