{"text": "The shift of tack by Russia may be the result of Mr Putin planning a surprise initiative as this year 's Apec chairman .There is talk of Russia coming up with an alternative to the Trans - Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , the mechanism through which New Zealand and eight other Apec members are trying to negotiate a \" high - quality \" free trade pact .Neither Russia nor China is a member of the United States - dominated TPP , and Russia does not see the grouping as being the precursor for a wider Asia - Pacific free trade area .Mr Putin 's competing and still vague \" Eurasian - Pacific \" initiative would include Russia , China and other central Asian nations and ultimately link Apec to the European Union .In order to be credible , however , the initiative will require that Russia shows a willingness to forge free trade agreements of the kind it has been negotiating with New Zealand .New Zealand , however , is wary of the domestic political difficulties facing Mr Putin and his colleagues when it comes to cutting tariffs .Back in 2010 , Russia took up a suggestion from Mr Groser that the two countries hammer out an FTA which , if it comes to fruition , will be the first of its kind for Russia .Last week Mr Groser would not rule out progress being made in Vladivostok , but said it was \" now very much up to the Russians \" .While in Vladivostok , New Zealand 's Trade Minister will meet his TPP counterparts , with ministers expected to reaffirm progress in negotiations , which have now reached a critical stage .However , dealing with the various sticking points is on hold until the outcome of the American presidential election is known .Meanwhile , New Zealand will also be keeping a close eye on another TPP - like arrangement , the fledgling Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) , which is being put together by members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( Asean ) .Mr Groser said there had been exploratory discussions for several years on something which could end up being a vast regional free trade area .New Zealand would be a member by virtue of its free trade agreement with Asean .Mr Groser saw the RCEP as \" useful insurance \" should the TPP negotiations fail to produce a result .We are not going to put all our eggs in the TPP basket , \" he said .The TPP has been seen by New Zealand as a back - door means of getting a free trade agreement with the United States .The latter is not party to the fledgling RCEP , however .This is the problem when you get countries wit large agricultural populations .Their governments do n't want to reduce tariffs on agricultural goods or all their small farmers go broke .Japan , South Korea and Russia all have lots of small farmers .My sincere best of luck for these talks .It will be great to close the deals soon as it will benefit all parties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.5812"}
