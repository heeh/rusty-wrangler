Jeremiah Wright , by castigating as racist a host of people , including his own white grandmother who he later lambasted as a \" typical white \" racist .Conspicuously omitted from Obama 's culpability list is the architect of modern day racism - the Democratic Party .Obama 's failure to even mention the Democratic Party 's racist past , while confessing that he lied about when he first heard Rev. Wright 's hateful rants , calls into question Obama 's character and judgment .Without flinching , Rev. Wright damned his own country , declaring that innocent Americans deserved to be killed by Islamic terrorists on September 11 , 2001 .Since Obama refuses to end his ties to Rev.

{"text": "Probably the safest way to ensure that no such thing happens would be for websites to not only self censor the content of the site , but to remove the possibility of user interaction entirely .David Cameron 's Internet firewall will silence countless independent websites and harm the commercial revenues of many legitimate businesses .It will drive coverage of certain legitimate issues off the Internet , and also drive website owners to shut down the freedom to comment on their content .Not only will Cameron 's firewall directly censor the Internet , it will also lead to indirect censorship as people take self - censorship measures out of fear of being silenced entirely by Cameron 's Internet firewall regime .Freedom of speech .Unlike citizens of the United States , the British public have no national constitutional guarantees of their freedom of speech .If access to an American website were blocked under instruction from the American government for nothing more than triggering an automatic keyword algorithm , the owner of the website would be able to claim a breach of their constitutional right to free speech had occurred and seek legal redress .It seems unlikely , even if small , independent bloggers like myself found out that their website was being censored by the Cameron Internet firewall regime , that they would have any recourse to the courts to challenge the state mandated censorship of their work .Denial of Service .One interesting area to consider is how the UK state deals with other groups that attempt to block access to web content .One of the strategies employed by activist groups such as Anonymous is called a Distributed Denial of Service Attack ( DDoS ) .These attacks are used to block access to a target website by flooding it with millions of fake requests for information .The UK government has essentially classified this kind of protest strategy as \" economic terrorism \" and outlawed the practice , setting a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment for individuals that are involved in launching DDoS attacks .Conclusion .Due to lack of oversight and accountability , the grounds for legal recourse for commercial losses or freedom of speech violations will be marginal .The potential for abuse of the system by the secret services , their private contractors , other government agencies and the private ISP companies ( that will be given free reign to administer their own web - censorship regimes ) is enormous .The hypocrisy of the government mandating ISPs to permanently block access to perfectly legal material , whilst threatening individuals that may attempt to temporarily block access to criminal organisations with up to 10 years imprisonment could n't be clearer .The petition on the government website needs 100,000 signatures to force apolitical debate on the issue .If you are opposed to David Cameron 's \" firewall \" please sign it and share it as widely as you are able .Another Angry Voice is a not - for - profit page which generates absolutely no revenue from advertising and accepts no money from corporate or political interests .The only source of revenue for Another Angry Voice is the PayPal donations box ( which can be found in the right hand column , fairly near the top of the page ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.171295"}

{"text": "Notably , in his speech , Obama mentioned the slavery history of the family of his wife , Michelle .He failed to say one word about the unsavory slave - owning past of his own white relatives .In fact , one of Obama 's ancestors , George Washington Overall , owned two slaves as is recorded in the Nelson County , Kentucky 1850 Census .The same records show that another one of Obama 's ancestors , Mary Duvall , also owned two slaves .All of Obama 's slave - owning forbearers were Democrats .It defies logic for Democrats to claim that , after Republicans spent over 100 years fighting the Democrats on behalf of blacks and finally won , all the racist Democrats suddenly rushed into the Republican Party .In fact , those racist Democrats declared that that they would rather vote for a \" yellow dog \" than a Republican because the Republican Party was known as the party for blacks .Facts about the racist past of the Democratic Party can be found in such books as A Short History of Reconstruction by Dr. Eric Foner , Unfounded Loyalty by Rev. Wayne Perryman , Bamboozled by Angela McGlowan , and Wrong on Race by Bruce Bartlett .Exposed in these books are the facts that the chief opponents of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act were Democrat Senators Sam Ervin , Albert Gore , Sr . and Robert Byrd , a former member of the Ku Klux Klan .Democrat President Lyndon Johnson is applauded as a proponent of civil rights .However , in his 4,500-word State of the Union Address delivered on January 4 , 1965 , Johnson mentioned scores of topics for federal action , but only thirty five words were devoted to civil rights .He did not mention one word about voting rights .Democrat President John F. Kennedy is lauded as a civil rights advocate .In reality , Kennedy voted against the 1957 Civil rights Act while he was a senator , as did Democrat Senator Al Gore , Sr .After he became president , John F. Kennedy opposed the 1963 March on Washington by Dr. King that was organized by A. Phillip Randolph who was a black Republican .President Kennedy , through his brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy , had Dr. King wiretapped and investigated by the FBI on suspicion of being a Communist in order to undermine Dr. King .In an effort to shift the racist past of the Democratic Party to the Republican Party , Democrats point a finger at Republican President Richard Nixon for his so - called \" Southern Strategy .\" These same Democrats expressed no concern when the racially segregated South voted solidly for Democrats ; yet unfairly deride Republicans because of the thirty - year odyssey of the South switching to the Republican Party that began in the 1970 's .Nixon 's \" Southern Strategy \" was an effort on his part to get fair - minded people in the South to stop voting for Democrats who did not share their values and were discriminating against blacks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.68177"}

Mike Huckabee used the phrase \" Uncle Sugar \" as a stand - in for a federal government that gives people things , I called it an \" obviously offensive dog - whistle - esque racialized characterization .\" The conservative Blaze said I called Huckabee racist .I did not .I wrote a clarification , saying there 's a difference between accusing someone of overt and deliberate racism versus saying that a phrase someone used \" consciously or unconsciously reflects and reinforces implicit racial bias .\" I purposefully try not to use the word \" racism \" since it indeed conjures up that very explicit and overt racism that we hope is a thing of the past .You can agree or disagree with our perspective , but at least acknowledge that vital nuance .Until 1865-less than 150 years ago - it was legal under the United States Constitution to own black people as chattel .Until 1964-just 50 years ago - racial segregation in schools and housing and public accommodations was legal in the United States .As recently as the 1980s - just a few decades ago- journalists documented that banks were lending to low - income white Americans but not middle or upper - income blacks .It 's not just that we had individual racists with ugly slurs and violent hands - though there was far too much of that throughout our history as well - but that racial hierarchy and unequal treatment was systematically incorporated into and reinforced by our country 's laws and rules .Implicit racial bias persists in America 's present .For every dollar of wealth owned by white folks in the United States today , black folks on average own less than a nickel .The unemployment rate for African Americans is around 13.2 percent , almost twice the rate for white Americans .Per pupil spending in public schools with 90 percent or more students of color is 18 percent less , or $ 733 less per student on average , than for schools with 90 percent or more white students .There are five white people using drugs in America for every one African American using drugs , and yet African Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of whites .And for convictions of the same crime , black men receive sentences that are 20 percent longer than white men .There are only two ways to account for these discrepancies in society .You can believe that black folks and people of color in general are inherently inferior - a sort of soft but nonetheless dangerous endorsement of racial bias often coded as \" cultural \" differences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.61659"}
