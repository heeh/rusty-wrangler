{"text": "Histories of the Chicano and feminist movements have failed to fully record the vital forms of Chicana political consciousness and organizing that existed in this period .While there are many other sources of Chicana feminist consciousness and organizing projects that need to be more fully documented , the story of Anna NietoGomez and members of Las Hijas de Cuauht\u00e9moc is a significant thread in the multilayered struggle around gender and sexuality in el movimiento .Although they were a small organization , their impact as one of the first organizations to explicitly call for and theorize Chicana feminism was paramount .Their ideas informed the terrain of struggle across movement sectors , reached into gendered discussions in other regions , and gave other women and men who believed in gender equity within the broader project of Chicano liberation a vehicle for speaking out .While their work was vital within the student movement , they were also part of a broader mobilization of movement women in the greater Los Angeles region that included the East Los Angeles Chicana Welfare Rights Organization and the Comisi\u00f3n Femenil Mexicana Nacional .While this history bursts with telling , it has been also been a challenging one to tell because it makes us reconsider the limited ( and limiting ) conventions of writing history .He argues that we engage \" simultaneously in the sociohistorical process and in narrative constructions about that process . \"8 Further , he argues : .What matters most are the process and conditions of production of such narratives .Only a focus on that process can uncover the ways in which the two sides of historicity intertwine in a particular context .Only through the overlap can we discover the differential exercise of power that makes some narratives possible and silences others.9 .It is not enough to say , \" The women were there , too . \"To subvert the ideologies of these official histories , we must overturn the epistemological register that licenses them .Because the add and stir method is not sufficient , this project proposes an alternative historiographic framework for understanding women 's social movements .Illustrating that history is more than just a narrative of the past , it examines how memory circulates in popular culture and produces and maintains political identities and the boundaries of what is politically possible today .It locates the contributions of the Hijas de Cuauht\u00e9moc within the development of Chicana feminism in relation to other organizations and contextualizes their interventions in regional , cross - regional , and national developments .And it reveals the unprecedented shifts in gendered consciousness and political subjectivity that resulted from women 's participation in the Chicano movement .The architecture of this book builds on the historical importance of the women I interviewed and the knowledge collectively produced in their oral histories .I begin to introduce them to you here in this prelude so that through their stories you can hear the distortions in the historical record .As in music , this prelude functions as more than just an introduction to the historical record .It sets the soundscape and signals the major riffs and musical samples of those narratives of the Chicano movement .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "21.442286"}
{"text": "Many of their families were displaced by the massive waves of migration brought on by the Mexican Revolution or were shaped by labor histories and the busts and booms of U.S. capitalism that have circumscribed the life chances of Mexicanos in the United States .This story interweaves the rich oral histories of Chicana activists and organizers and is deeply rooted in the oral history of Anna NietoGomez .Many histories of women of color are often told through , and thus structured by , the historiographic practices that have created silences about them .We recognize that we are oppressed as Raza and as women .We believe that the struggle is not with the male but with the existing system of oppression .But the Chicano must also be educated to the problems and oppression of La Chicana so that he may not be used as a tool to divide by keeping man against woman .\" Our Philosophy , \" Las Hijas de Cuauht\u00e9moc ( 1971 ) .As one of the first explicitly feminist Chicana political groups in the Chicano movement , the Hijas de Cuauht\u00e9moc emerged within the ranks of the United Mexican American Students ( UMAS ) at California State University , Long Beach , in 1968 .After the historic 1969 Plan de Santa Barbara UMAS , along with other youth organizations and student groups , united under the name el Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl\u00e1n ( MEChA ) .Ironically , the focus of these educational meetings quickly shifted from imparting political knowledge to addressing issues that were emerging from the women 's experience in the movement .Eventually these meetings provided a vehicle for discussing internal sexual politics , as well as a space for naming the issues affecting working - class Chicanas that were not being addressed in Chicano student movement organizations .Chicana activists began to speak about the conditions of their lives ; to analyze how they were positioned by multiple and interlocking oppressions of race , class , and gender ; and to understand the collective issues faced by women entering the university for the first time .A growing critique emerged that centered on the gap between the movement 's rhetoric on equal rights and the ways in which women were treated not as equal social and political actors but as secretaries and cooks .Although women were the backbone of the student movement , providing much of the labor , they were rarely public leaders and even more rarely did they stay in their designated place .From the very inception of the Chicano student movement in the late 1960s , there were informal Chicana leaders and specific women 's agendas .The role of women and gender ideology were hotly debated - a fact that has been left out of most movement histories .This erasure normalizes a masculine hegemony within the Chicano movement that was much more contested at the time .It was a dispute regarding the nomination of Anna NietoGomez for the presidency of MEChA that transformed the informal women 's discussion group into an autonomous women 's organization .Many women , however , continued as members of MEChA , engaging in what Latin American feminists have called double militancia , or double activism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "24.12286"}

{"text": "Chicana feminism , also called Xicanisma , is a sociopolitical movement in the United States that analyzes the historical , cultural , spiritual , educational , and economic intersections of Mexican - American women that identify as Chicana .It challenges the stereotypes they [ Chicanas ] face across lines of gender , ethnicity , race , class , and sexuality .Most importantly , Chicana feminism serves as a movement that helps women to reclaim their existence between the Chicano and American feminist movement . \"Social upheaval dominated the 1960s and 1970s as newly mobilized communities fought for equality in the U.S. As domestic protests against the Vietnam War increased , civil rights organizations would win important political battles against institutional racism , while \" Second Wave \" American feminism would emerge from its infancy as a full - fledged movement .The Chicano movement gained similar momentum during this moment , but within it many women felt their unique identity - both intertwined with their brothers in struggle , but specifically distinct as Chicano women - was being ignored .A Chicana feminist movement galvanized in reaction to the complexities of Latina empowerment , often facing resistance from male Chicano leaders and organizers .While many forms of gender inequality exposed by mainline American feminism were relevant to women of color , overall the race and class experiences of white and brown women did not correlate .White feminists enjoyed access to racial privileges and simply did not speak to the injustices experienced by women of color .Moreover , they often failed to define themselves in terms that positively or proactively involved men , while many Chicanas remained invested in the struggles of the men in their community despite the patriarchy of traditional Mexican - American culture .Rather than acceding to the common request that they wait their turn , Chicana feminists saw that the sexism within the Chicano Movement intersected with racism in the larger society , and made addressing both simultaneously as a central component to their ideology .\" [ 1 ] .The Chicana feminist paradigm has taken on different roles , redefining its meaning from its inception until present day .However , the multi - faceted movement remains one that continues to recognize and give Mexican - American women a space to unapologetically celebrate and reclaim their identity .Chicana feminist consciousness grew from the intersections they [ Chicanas ] faced not only outside their culture , but within .They challenged their prescribed role in la familia , and demanding to have the intersections they faced recognized .With the emergence of the Chicano Movement , the structure of Chicano families changed dramatically .Specifically , women began to question the role that they were assigned within the family and where their place was within the Chicano national struggle .[ 2 ] .Beginning in the 1940s , Mexican - Americans led a civil rights movement with a goal of achieving Mexican - American empowerment .By the 1960s , the Chicano Movement , also known as \" El Movimiento , \" became a prominent campaign in the lives of many Mexican - American workers and youth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "34.474678"}

{"text": "Ironically , the focus of these educational meetings quickly shifted from imparting political knowledge to addressing issues that were emerging from the women 's experience in the movement .Eventually these meetings provided a vehicle for discussing internal sexual politics , as well as a space for naming the issues affecting working - class Chicanas that were not being addressed in Chicano student movement organizations .Chicana activists began to speak about the conditions of their lives ; to analyze how they were positioned by multiple and interlocking oppressions of race , class , and gender ; and to understand the collective issues faced by women entering the university for the first time .A growing critique emerged that centered on the gap between the movement 's rhetoric on equal rights and the ways in which women were treated not as equal social and political actors but as secretaries and cooks .Although women were the backbone of the student movement , providing much of the labor , they were rarely public leaders and even more rarely did they stay in their designated place .From the very inception of the Chicano student movement in the late 1960s , there were informal Chicana leaders and specific women 's agendas .The role of women and gender ideology were hotly debated - a fact that has been left out of most movement histories .This erasure normalizes a masculine hegemony within the Chicano movement that was much more contested at the time .It was a dispute regarding the nomination of Anna NietoGomez for the presidency of MEChA that transformed the informal women 's discussion group into an autonomous women 's organization .Many women , however , continued as members of MEChA , engaging in what Latin American feminists have called double militancia , or double activism .Although NietoGomez was democratically elected by the many students with whom she worked , her leadership was consistently undermined by a few male leaders of MEChA who stated openly that they did not want to be represented by a woman .They criticized Chicanas who demanded that women 's rights be respected , arguing that they were playing into the dominant culture 's attempt to divide the movement .Ironically , however , it was actually the chauvinism , discrimination , and sexual harassment of those male leaders that in part led to the rise of feminism among Chicanas in the youth movement .Women throughout the Chicano movement were no longer willing to tolerate internal organizational practices and masculinist political culture , which were exclusionary , undemocratic , and unfair .They fought the suppression of women 's leadership and the sexual politics and double standards they experienced by holding their comrades accountable , organizing women 's caucuses , and , after much negotiation , forming their own organizations .Their local campus and community organizing was linked to other Chicana organizing in Texas , New Mexico , and Colorado , as well as in San Diego / Tijuana , the San Francisco Bay Area , and the Central Valley of California .Working together , Chicana activists in the greater Los Angeles area organized the first regional Chicana conference , held at Cal State Los Angeles on May 8 , 1971 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "35.3582"}
{"text": "The Anglo women focused on gender and felt that Chicanas should choose gender over culture .Chicanas had faced oppression concerning all three of these and did not think that one was more important than the other .Also , Chicanas lack of participation in the Anglo Feminist movement helped to reassure Chicano loyalists that they were not traitors to their culture and community .22 The Women 's Liberation movement viewed the Chicana women , and other minorities as well , as all similar .The classism of the movement failed to recognize the diverse background that these women came from .Anglo feminists felt superior not only in race but in class and often undermined and disregarded the ideology of different minority feminist movements .On the basis of the subordination of women , there can be no real unity ....The only real unity between men and women is the unity forged in the course of struggle against their oppression .And it is by supporting , rather than opposing , the struggles of women , that Chicanos and Chicanas can genuinely unite . \"- Mirta Vidal , The Unity of \" La Raza \" ( 1972 ) 17 The 1970s and 1980s saw the awakening of social awareness and political activism in Mexican - American communities .In San Diego , a group of Chicana women participated in a political theatre group whose plays addressed social , gender , and political issues of the working class and the Chicano Movement .In this collective memoir , seventeen women who were a part of Teatro de las Chicanas ( later known as Teatro Laboral and Teatro Ra\u00edces ) come together to share why they joined the theatre and how it transformed their lives .Teatro Chicana tells the story of this troupe through chapters featuring the history and present - day story of each of the main actors and writers , as well as excerpts from the group 's materials and seven of their original short scripts .The teatro ( theater ) experience transformed the many women who were part of it , and the progressive street teatro movement of the 1960s and 1970s was , in turn , transformed by those women who contributed their talents and their hearts to it .This book is about the women in the Teatro de las Chicanas , a grass - roots troupe that later operated under a variety of names , including Teatro Laboral and Teatro Ra\u00edces .For over a decade , beginning in 1971 , the women performed at political rallies , at antiwar demonstrations , in high school gyms , at community centers , and at practically every imaginable makeshift venue .This ragtag group put on short plays about the issues of the day , from immigration to police brutality , to discrimination in the public schools and the emerging feminist movement .It was the time of the \" Chicano Movement , \" coined to describe the social movement of Mexican - Americans in the Southwest against social discrimination .The kernel of the idea for an all - woman teatro started when the women of MEChA decided to bring their mothers to the university campus setting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "36.56047"}

{"text": "Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00eda , speaking in more general terms , stated that Chicanas / os \" produce an art of place , where location is central to the representation of the self in many individual and collective guises . \"Indigenism offered Chicanas / os a means by which to address the specificity of their indigenous roots without circumscribing their cultural identity .The notion that Chicana / o community muralism is essentially an \" art of place \" implies that this practice is essentially site specific .Nevertheless , although many community murals must be understood in the context of the barrio setting and in relation to the period in which they were made , they rarely , if ever , remain static signifiers of particular moments and places in history .However , the site specificity of the Chicana / o Indigenist murals in California aligned them with the movement of site - specific work that emerged simultaneously in the 1960s and 1970s within more mainstream artistic spheres in the United States and Europe .According to art historian Miwon Kwon , site - specific work \" focused on establishing an inextricable , indivisible relationship between the work and its site and then demanded the physical presence of the viewer for the work 's completion . \" Artists who engaged in this type of work , Kwon continued , resisted \" the forces of the capitalist market economy , which circulates artworks as transportable and exchangeable commodity goods .\" Site specificity functioned under the assumption that the space in which art resides is neither innocent nor devoid of meaning but rather laden with dynamics of signification and , as such , is necessarily complicit with its location .Leuthold further argues that in indigenous art the sacred quality attributed to particular locations and sites is accompanied by a sense of responsibility toward that place , its community , and its environment .For the most part , Chicana / o muralists conscientiously sought to work with the qualities that are already intrinsic at any given site , thus avoiding interfering with many of the natural dynamics that are already in place there .Conversely , the practice of transforming and manipulating natural spaces is one closely aligned with colonialist and imperialist enterprises .Chicana / o artists were conscious of how colonial and expansionist states often disturbed and ultimately destroyed natural environments , and they therefore developed strategies to interact rather than disrupt the natural dynamics of space and place .Another significant dimension to the issue of space in relationship to Chicanas / os ' Indigenist consciousness centered around the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ( 1848 ) as a key episode in U.S./Mexican history .The annexation of Mexico 's northern provinces during the mid - nineteenth century changed the citizenship rights and social status of some 100,000 Mexicans , many of whom were indigenous inhabitants of the area .Chicana / o activists argued that this particular event in U.S. history explained the current marginalization of Mexicans and Mexican Americans in this country .Richard Griswold del Castillo , in his 1990 monograph entitled The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , outlined the process of self - education Chicana / o activists underwent during the civil rights movement , when many learned about this treaty and its implications .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.398884"}
{"text": "If representation itself becomes hampered by a colonialist gaze , then self - representation necessarily implies a reversal of that process , as Steven Leuthold argues : \" Indigenous self - representation primarily involves a shift in authority , implying that inherent in cross - cultural representations are the dynamics of power .\" Mexican and Chicana / o Indigenism in Murals .Though we can speak of several important Indigenist moments in the history of the Americas , Chicana / o creative expressions of the 1960s and beyond were most significantly influenced by the Indigenist revival that occurred during and shortly after the Mexican Revolution of 1910 .While various Chicana / o thinkers regarded the Mexican Revolution as a metaphor for the contemporaneous struggles they waged , its historical importance also held a more tangible relevance to Mexican Americans .Many of the Chicanas / os who came of age during the conflicts of the civil rights movement were either the children or grandchildren of these immigrants .In the conscious imagination of many activists and artists , the Chicano Movement operated as an extension of the political and cultural debates instituted by the Revolution .After all , this event ennobled the cause of land reform to benefit Indians , and it also glorified leaders like Emiliano Zapata , whose indigenous blood symbolized the very essence of the Mexican nation .Though Chicana / o muralism resides at the intersection of various currents and tendencies , the historical connection to the Mexican mural renaissance is quite self - evident .Nearly half a century prior to the flowering of Chicana / o muralism in California , the state had already become an important site for Mexican muralism .As far as the generation of Chicana / o artists of the sixties and seventies was concerned , however , the most pivotal Mexican mural was undoubtedly Siqueiros 's La Am\u00e9rica Tropical ( Tropical America ; 1932 ) , located on Los Angeles 's Olvera Street .La Am\u00e9rica Tropical also demonstrated the powerful effects political statements coupled with Indigenist aesthetics could have when displayed in a public mural .Mexican Indigenist art also migrated to California via the work of Alfredo Ramos Mart\u00ednez , who had led Mexico 's Academia de San Carlos in the early twenties and eventually settled in Los Angeles in 1929 .His open - air paintings and indigenous subjects had considerable influence on many Southern California artists of the period .During the decades of the 1950s and early 1960s , several Mexican American artists contributed much to the area 's artistic patrimony , even though their oeuvre often went largely unnoticed .Referring to Ram\u00edrez 's experience immigrating to the United States during the Mexican Revolution and his subsequent bouts with paranoid schizophrenia , Paz erroneously and dismissively described his work as that of a solitary and isolated genius who neither exerted influence on nor received influence from broader artistic currents .Nevertheless , Chicago artist Jim Nutt \" discovered \" his drawings in 1968 , and later , approximately one decade after Ram\u00edrez 's death in 1960 , the Mexican artist 's work became the subject of various exhibitions around the country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.41043"}

{"text": "In this book , the first comprehensive study of Chicano / a detective fiction , Ralph E. Rodriguez examines the recent contributions to the genre by writers such as Rudolfo Anaya , Lucha Corpi , Rolando Hinojosa , Michael Nava , and Manuel Ramos .Their works reveal the struggles of Chicanas / os with feminism , homosexuality , familia , masculinity , mysticism , the nationalist subject , and U.S.-Mexico border relations .He maintains that their novels register crucial new discourses of identity , politics , and cultural citizenship that can not be understood apart from the historical instability following the demise of the nationalist politics of the Chicana / o movement of the 1960s and 1970s .In contrast to that time , when Chicanas / os sought a unified Chicano identity in order to effect social change , the 1980s , 1990s , and 2000s have seen a disengagement from these nationalist politics and a new trend toward a heterogeneous sense of self .The detective novel and its traditional focus on questions of knowledge and identity turned out to be the perfect medium in which to examine this new self .Common conceptions permeating U.S. ethnic queer theory tend to confuse aesthetics with real - world acts and politics .Often Chicano / a representations of gay and lesbian experiences in literature and film are analyzed simply as propaganda .The cognitive , emotional , and narrational ingredients ( that is , the subject matter and the formal traits ) of those representations are frequently reduced to a priori agendas that emphasize a politics of difference .In this book , Frederick Luis Aldama follows an entirely different approach .He investigates the ways in which race and gay / lesbian sexuality intersect and operate in Chicano / a literature and film while taking into full account their imaginative nature and therefore the specific kind of work invested in them .Also , Aldama frames his analyses within today 's larger ( globalized ) context of postcolonial literary and filmic canons that seek to normalize heterosexual identity and experience .Throughout the book , Aldama applies his innovative approach to throw new light on the work of authors Arturo Islas , Richard Rodriguez , John Rechy , Ana Castillo , and Sheila Ortiz Taylor , as well as that of film director Edward James Olmos .In doing so , Aldama aims to integrate and deepen Chicano literary and filmic studies within a comparative perspective .Aldama 's unusual juxtapositions of narrative materials and cultural personae , and his premise that literature and film produce fictional examples of a social and historical reality concerned with ethnic and sexual issues largely unresolved , make this book relevant to a wide range of readers .Puerto Ricans , African Americans , and the Pursuit of Racial Justice in New York City .Sonia Song - Ha Lee .In the first book - length history of Puerto Rican civil rights in New York City , Sonia Lee traces the rise and fall of an uneasy coalition between Puerto Rican and African American activists from the 1950s through the 1970s .Previous work has tended to see blacks and Latinos as either naturally unified as \" people of color \" or irreconcilably at odds as two competing minorities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "42.790115"}
{"text": "Moreover , it was at SBI that for the first time most pintas came into close proximity with African Americans and whites .There , they learned to put aside their barrio gang rivalries in order to provide a \" united front \" before the overwhelmingly white female guard force and the significant African - American prisoner population .Conversely , pintas learned to set aside interracial , interethnic rivalries and joined with non - Chicana prisoners to demand changes in treatment and living conditions .In fact , I found only a few references to SBI in mainstream newspapers , grassroots feminist newsletters , government publications , and social science literature ( Watterson 1996 ) despite the fact that SBI was the Los Angeles County women 's jail for 34 years .A look at Chicanas ' experiences of incarceration at SBI also demonstrates that the patterns of abuse Chicanas encountered on the outside continued on the inside at the hands of penal staff .Once institutionalized , Chicanas were further stigmatized , now as convicts .Such stigmatization contributed further to their alienation from and rejection by society at large .While this book focuses on experiences of pintas in the California criminal justice system , it is important to place these experiences in an international context wherein Latinas / os everywhere are targeted for arrest and incarceration under the auspices of the U.S.-led international war on drugs .It is within this setting that we can best understand the motivations and conditions under which Chicanas in California are repeatedly arrested and imprisoned primarily for low - level , nonviolent economic and drug - related crimes .Other chapters illustrate how the drug war is played out in Chicana / o communities in California and in the lives of Chicanas in particular .For although drug policies were only one factor pintas contended with , these perpetuated the cycle of personal and systemic violence to which the women were exposed throughout their lives .Likewise , the drug war exacerbated discriminatory criminal justice policies based primarily on race / ethnicity , gender , and social class .Yet , the war on drugs did little to reduce pintas ' addictions ; rather , it increased their isolation and alienation from society at large , thus reinforcing their inclination to use drugs .Having said this , however , the fact remains that the war on drugs was only one of the many obstacles pintas faced .As a result , Chapters 2 - 18 examine , in chronological order , several major themes discussed in the life histories of the 24 pintas at the center of this book .By tracing simultaneously their individual and collective experiences with the Family , the Barrio , and the State , we arrive at a preliminary composite \" biography \" of the life of a pinta .( Some individual narratives are printed in extended form because they amplify particular points , demonstrate the progression of some point being made , or illustrate issues of agency that were not covered earlier . )In order to differentiate between the experiences of pintas prior to their first adult incarceration and their experiences during and after incarceration , the book is divided into two parts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.213486"}

{"text": "In addressing these questions , I found a genuine danger in applying essentialist frameworks to Chicana / o culture .Thinking of Mexico as a culture of origin inscribed in the Mexican American consciousness would obscure the complexity associated with the formation of bordered identities in the United States .By contrast , thinking of the relationship between Mexican and Chicana / o art as a dialectic provides a more fluid model of analysis .Anthropologist Charles W. Nuckolls described cultural systems as dialectical phenomena in that they are \" made up of dynamic conflicts between the whole and its parts . \" Drawing from Mikhail Bakhtin , communication studies scholars Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery , in discussing the nature of interpersonal exchanges , commented on how forces of unity and difference ( or centripetal and centrifugal forces ) often collaborate in the formation of social relations .The relationship between Chicana / o culture and Mexican culture can be described as a relational yet conflictive and oppositional dialogue .Chicana / o art then becomes conversant with Mexican currents , but often in a critical and contesting fashion .Though a visual dialogue takes place between the Mexican and Chicana / o muralists , this dialogue often involves a multivocal process whereby dissenting and consenting voices contribute to the creation of a unified cultural product .Chicana / o community muralism can be regarded as that product , given that it simultaneously embraced and digressed from the Mexican canon .This element of \" contradiction \" and \" opposition , \" however , does not point to stagnation in the cultural process , but instead ushers in the creation of an emerging new cultural system .As seen in community murals , the dialectic process played a particularly relevant role in the construction of Chicana / o Indigenism .Informed by Mexican Indigenist thinking and iconography , Chicanas / os revived their indigenous roots by reusing cultural paraphernalia already circulating in other spheres .Even though the social and political arenas were dramatically different , Chicanos / os frequently cited and alluded to Mexican Indigenism and muralism in their work during the civil rights movement .As in Mexico , the emergence of Indigenism and muralism in the United States happened after a period of critical social and political turmoil .In many ways , Chicana / o artists saw a model of socially engaged art in the Mexican mural renaissance .But while the Indigenist ideology , along with the muralist projects in Mexico , formed a symbiotic part of institutional initiatives to rebuild the nation - state after the Revolution , in the United States , both became phenomena occurring on the fringes of official discourses .As such , Indigenism among Chicanas / os initially emerged as a counterideology , that is , an alternative to hegemonic discourses about marginalized minorities not only in Mexico but also in the United States .Indigenist imagery for many Chicana / o muralists arose as a means to express forms of resistance and protest not sanctioned by state apparatuses .Regardless of whether Chicana / o muralists constructed Indigenism through the borrowing of different styles , themes , or concepts , this process generally remained a highly critical and interventionist one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.546158"}

{"text": "In the process , I argue that through the public mural , Chicanas / os found a unique and effective tool with which to assert agency from the margins .In subsequent chapters of this project , this theoretical analysis provides a methodological foundation that allows me to engage the visual vocabulary of these murals as well as to discuss the activities and aspirations of the individual artists or collectives who created them .Instead , the focus of this volume is to generate an understanding of the sorts of strategies deployed by the so - called subaltern in order to create a compelling and decolonized frame of self - representation .The Indigenist aesthetic that Chicana / o artists created provides a model for ways in which marginalized communities can empower themselves against the grain of dominant ideologies .The images of indigenous America depicted in many California Chicana / o murals engaged a long history of Indigenist aesthetics and discourse in the Americas .The words \" Indigenism \" and \" Indigenist \" here will be distinguished and differentiated from the terms indigeneity and indigenous .Generally speaking , \" Indigenism \" refers to the act of consciously adopting an indigenous identity - which may otherwise not be fully self - evident - for a political or strategic purpose .The Indigenist posture often seeks to overturn historical processes in order to exact radical change .Indigenism as an ideology , however , can operate in favor but also against the needs of the native peoples themselves , and thus one must be cautious when resorting to it .Indeed , individuals or institutions outside of indigenous communities have utilized Indigenism in their quest to incorporate America 's native cultures into articulations of national , cultural , or racial identity .Indigenism can constitute a political posture that seeks to construct race rather than define cultural practices .Bonfil Batalla further argues that the assimilation and co - optation of indigenous people forms part of a larger project of preparing nascent nation - states for capitalist enterprising .In the Americas , especially Latin America , Indigenism also emerged as a solution to identity crises arising as a result of political and social turmoil ( wars , radical changes in government , movements of civil or human rights , etc . ) .Paternalist forms of Indigenism make up an integral part of a Pan - Americanist spirit that seeks to rid itself of European control while still maintaining Western institutions .By contrast , indigeneity , as understood in this book , will refer to the organic expressions that emerge from the indigenous communities themselves , which may or may not have anything to do with the official Indigenism often espoused by nation - states .While these expressions may be understood and even appropriated by non - natives , indigeneity primarily serves the spiritual and pragmatic needs of indigenous communities and nations without necessarily having to profess an overt political and anticolonialist agenda behind them .Notwithstanding , Indigenist and indigenous expressions can overlap or even negate one another .Admittedly , we could argue that in colonial and postcolonial contexts , any expression of indigenous culture is inevitably Indigenist and thus political because , consciously or not , it counters dominant culture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.317814"}
{"text": "The organization grew to the point where a need for a space for artists was planned .The RCAF established the Centro de Artistas Chicanos moving from temporary quarters in homes , garages and La Raza Bookstore to Holy Angels School at 7th and T Streets .Later , a space was established on Folsom Blvd . and finally a center on Franklin Blvd .These spaces allowed for continual meetings , planning of events , workshops , studio activity and freedom to work around the clock .First , Max Garcia took on the directorship , followed by Gina Montoya and Ricardo Favela .Thousands of posters were created over the years with designs from multiple artists .Murals were painted throughout Sacramento ( many now painted over ) as well as Chicano Park in San Diego and in Washington and Oregon .Through the university , Jose Montoya , Esteban Villa and , later , Ricardo Favela , taught a generation of young artists the techniques of silk screen , muralism , drawing , and painting .Jose Montoya went on to establish the Barrio Art Program , representing an effort to reduce barriers between the CSU campus and the Alkalai Flats community .The Barrio Art Program brought young people and senior citizens together with aspiring teachers in the University 's teacher training courses to learn to integrate the arts with education .The program continues to this day at the Washington Neighborhood Center located in downtown Sacramento at 16th and D Streets .Other RCAF artists , like Juanishi Orosco , Armando Cid and Rudy Cuellar taught there as well as in other community settings .Armando Cid and Juan Cervantez became artist facilitators in the Arts in Corrections Program teaching art and bringing guest artists to adult inmates .The RCAF had also a history of bringing the arts to youth offenders within the California Youth Authority , specifically at the reform school known as the Preston School of Industry in Ione , CA .Through the efforts of RCAF members and CSU students , Phillip \" Pike \" Santos and Louie \" the Foot \" Gonzalez , La Raza Bookstore was established in 1972 .The absence of written works about or by Chicanos and Native Americans led to this effort .The Bookstore was established at 1228 F Street , Sacramento .Later a gallery was established and the name was changed to La Raza Bookstore / Galeria Posada ( named in honor of Jose Guadalupe Posada ) .The RCAF was featured prominently over the years in exhibitions , but perhaps more importantly , it became the exhibition space for countless numbers of visual artists of national importance .This community bookstore and gallery became an active center for Chicano / Latino and Native American art , poetry and music .Following the administrative oversight by Phillip Santos , the bookstore has had as some of its directors : Armando Cid , Tere Romo , Victoria Plata , Luis Chabolla , Marisa Gutierrez , Francisca Godinez and since 2008 , Marie Acosta .La Raza / Galeria Posada is now occupying its sixth home in its 40 + years of existence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.486893"}

{"text": "More than a chronological span of dates and an ordering of facts , these archaeologies of memory not only tell a different story but also engage in a different mode of telling .The Archive and the Repertoire of Oral History .This book draws on two different ways of knowing and telling .One site of knowledge production is the alternative archive - what I call Chicana print cultures - that forged a Chicana counterpublic during the 1960s and 1970s .Taylor distinguishes the repertoire from archival memory that functions across time and space because \" archival memory succeeds in separating the source of ' knowledge ' from the knower - in time and/or space\"-and can be recaptured years later by a researcher .She argues , \" The repertoire , on the other hand , enacts embodied memory : performances , gestures , orality , movement , dance , singing - in short , all those acts usually thought of as ephemeral , non - reproducible knowledge .The repertoire requires presence : people participate in the production and reproduction of knowledge by ' being there , ' being a part of the transmission .\" I approach oral history as a memory performance and part of the repertoire because it \" both keeps and transforms choreographies of meaning .\" Taylor 's notion of repertoire , as embodied knowledge / practice , is useful for understanding oral history as a form of \" embodied memory , because it is live , and exceeds the archive 's ability to capture it . \"Critically , Taylor argues that like the archive , the repertoire is also mediated .Unlike performance studies , in oral history the \" oral \" is burdened by the \" history , \" which bears the traces of the weightiness of officiality , rules of evidence , and the pressures of positivism .Perhaps oral history is a hybrid that fits somewhere in between the archive and the repertoire , depending on how the narrator narrates , how the listener listens , and how the researcher wields the apparatus of objectivity that records or captures this performance .Ultimately , it may come down to how much we listen to the embodied practice of memory and the shifting conditions under which knowledge can be shared rather than reduce that memory performance only to a transcript to be studied .I am attracted to Taylor 's beautiful conceptualization of the repertoire because it represents the gestures , tones , and sighs - the literal performance of memory , how narrators rock themselves when they talk of difficult memories , how we stop the tape when tears flow .In this way oral history as performance is part of the repertoire ( and its transcript belongs to the archive ) .An added dimension of the word repertoire is that it is used by social movement scholars to refer to the range of strategies and tactics that social movement actors use to create and contest meaning , power , and representation .I argue that memory is also part of the repertoire of the excluded , politically marginalized , and specifically the colonized .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.79987"}

{"text": "Likewise , the use of wall painting itself functioned as an act of subversion and decentralization of other modern mural movements that were institutionally supported and state sanctioned , like the so - called Mexican School of painting .The resurrection of Indigenist thought and aesthetics allowed Chicanas / os to build a nation without government sponsorship and on the fringes of the mainstream establishment .But , ultimately , the use of Mexican Indigenism signified for Chicanas / os the reclaiming of a culture and a history traditionally commodified by Western powers of colonization .Aztl\u00e1n and the Politics of Place and Space .When Chicana / o artists chose to use murals as vehicles for Indigenist aesthetics , it was not by coincidence or happenstance .One of the most significant connections between the concept of Indigenism and muralism involved the symbolic implications of space and place that both tendencies invoked .The concept of Aztl\u00e1n composed an important element of Chicana / o Indigenism .According to Mexica history , the Aztecs migrated south to Tenochtitl\u00e1n from a northern homeland called Aztl\u00e1n .In the manifesto entitled \" El Plan Espiritual de Aztl\u00e1n \" ( 1969 ) , written primarily by the Chicano poet Alurista with assistance from Denver muralist Manuel Mart\u00ednez,34 Chicanas / os geographically identified this homeland as the U.S. Southwest .Regarding themselves as the descendants of the Aztecs who currently inhabited Aztl\u00e1n , Chicana / o activists saw the Mexican American presence in this area as a fulfillment of this mythical return to the homeland .Not only did Aztl\u00e1n , as a concept , contest the categorization of Chicanas / os as an invariably immigrant community , it also provided them with a physical and symbolic space that had previously been denied to them by official U.S. histories .To further legitimize the existence of Aztl\u00e1n , many Chicana / o writers often cited a critical primary - source text , namely , the 1610 conquest chronicles of Gaspar P\u00e9rez de Villagr\u00e1 entitled Historia de la Nueva M\u00e9xico .In the first chapter , P\u00e9rez de Villagr\u00e1 describes in great detail the lands of the U.S. Southwest while also identifying them as the former home of the Aztec Empire .But Aztl\u00e1n was not only a geographical location for Chicana / o artists and activists ; it was also a spiritual space where decolonizing frames of mind could be fully realized .Aztl\u00e1n was a concept capable of converging into one discursive space many of the concerns affecting Chicanas / os , as Rafael P\u00e9rez - Torres elucidates : \" The ideas embodied in Aztl\u00e1n draw together geography , culture , history , genetics , migration , tradition , heritage , unity , authenticity . \" Like the notion of Aztl\u00e1n , wall paintings , too , had the unique capacity to carve out physical and symbolic spaces for the articulation of identity .In turn , Chicana / o Indigenism , of which the concept of Aztl\u00e1n was a crucial component , sought to push the national and psychological border that had marginalized Mexican - descent communities in the United States .Thus , muralism celebrated the urban spaces prescribed to the Chicana / o nation and often transformed the barrio environment into an Indigenist realm .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.537525"}

{"text": "We will tread carefully in this volume as we navigate the nuanced and subtle distinctions between Indigenism and indigeneity and will proceed with caution through the problematic history of Indigenism .The Chicana / o Indigenist aesthetic and discourse posed a unique phenomenon in the history of counterhegemonic struggles in the Americas , for it was positioned somewhere between Indigenism and indigeneity .As it emerged in various forms of creative and political expression during and after the Chicano Movement , Chicana / o Indigenism redeployed many of the strategies and tools of previous Indigenist initiatives but with critically different motives , goals , and outcomes .As with earlier Indigenist projects , Chicana / o artists sought to consciously and strategically embrace indigenous culture for political purposes .Some Chicana / o activists , intellectuals , and artists even looked to the Indigenist campaigns in Mexico after the Revolution of 1910 as a model for understanding how indigeneity can be incorporated in the construction of national formations .But within the cultural context of the United States , where indigenous culture is excluded on all levels of nationalist agendas , the act of proclaiming an indigenous identity as an identifying marker of the Chicana / o experience in this country was necessarily a subversive and transgressive move .Most importantly , however , Chicana / o Indigenism transcended the need to adopt politically strategic discourses and postures .The Indigenist aesthetic and discourse that would surface on the coattails of the Chicano Movement afforded the Mexican American community the unprecedented opportunity to be themselves , quite literally .Moreover , in the process of reclaiming their indigeneity , Chicanas / os were seeking to rehabilitate the systems of collective support and communal protection that were prevalent among the native populations in the Americas prior to the arrival of Europeans who brought with them a more individualistic and capital - driven culture .Nevertheless , many of the Indigenist images and ideas Chicana / o artists and thinkers embraced did not come directly from their own personal indigenous experiences but from their process of politicization and self - education that prompted them to study Mexican history and culture , both ancient and modern .For example , the spiritual connection that Chicana artists and writers established with the Aztec earth goddess Coatlicue emerged out of their profound readings of Mesoamerican texts .Nevertheless , Coatlicue , whose abilities included the extraordinary power to give and take away life and whose anthropomorphic features were both beautiful and horrific , represented the embodiment of polar opposites and contradictions , a characteristic that mirrored and legitimized Chicanas ' subject positions .Because Chicanas / os were not indigenous in the same way that Native Americans were , their political consciousness reflected both Indigenist ( politically motivated ) and indigenous ( organically manifested ) proclivities .The hybridity , or mestizaje , within the Chicana / o community , while not negating the connection to other native populations , conditioned its activists to navigate between these two realms of political , social , and cultural being , namely , Indigenism and indigeneity .In Mexico , the construction of Indigenism implied no overt intention to work against the interests of native populations , but there was an attempt to diffuse the possibility of revolts or insurgences among the country 's indigenous communities , whose consciousness had been dangerously awakened during the Revolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.389023"}

{"text": "Although representations of indigenous populations date as far back as the conquest , the use of such representations to construct the nation - state signals a fairly modern phenomenon .Prior to the nineteenth century , European colonizers produced images of Indians in written and visual texts to further reiterate their own cultural identity and superiority in the face of growing miscegenation .Nations like Mexico , for instance , openly embraced indigenous iconography during the modern phases of their artistic development .This new aesthetic , though complicit with European coloniality , signaled a desire to proclaim a voice independent of foreign avant - garde trends .Indigenism , specifically in the Mexican context , did not provide platforms for self - representation for indigenous peoples , but rather created a state - sanctioned visual vocabulary that articulated a native identity according to the precepts of the new nation - state after the Mexican Revolution of 1910 .As part of Mexico 's educational reforms during the first few decades of the twentieth century , the education minister Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos commissioned elaborate mural cycles to help the populace visually conceive the shape this new nation - state would take .The power of the public mural , as the Mexican muralists of the 1920s and 1930s knew , resided in its ability to not only prescribe ideology but also construct its own spectators .When addressing Mexican indigenous history and culture , Diego Rivera was perhaps the one muralist who best understood the role that murals could play in the creation of a national collective identity .The unproblematized and often romantic Indigenism that emerged in the mural cycles he painted throughout Mexico became emblematic of the nationalist ideologies regarding the Mexican native communities .Contesting Modernism and the Avant - Garde .The spirit of the Chicana / o arts movement presented a diametrically opposed school of thought to the prevailing discourses and practices surrounding the visual arts in the field of art history and criticism , in particular , modern and contemporary art history .The categories that defined established art history as well as time - honored museum practices proved to be utterly irrelevant to the practice of Chicana / o art .The categories pertinent to the standard periodization utilized in traditional art - historical methodologies - namely , prehistoric , ancient , medieval , Renaissance , modern , and contemporary art - proved to be inaccurate and even obstructive to the understanding of indigenous art , including Chicana / o creative expressions .The classification \" non - Western \" was also fraught with recurring colonialist visions and discourses that defined indigenous arts as exotic and primitive .Of particular interest to this study , however , is the way European and Euro - American academic thinking constructed the role of art and artists in the modern era .Art was the result of the most elevated form of creative endeavor coming from an intellectual elite .Art existed independently and quite above the mundane goings - on of everyday life and existence .The artist , as the human vessel for this creative force , held a special place in society , for he or she ( though mostly he ) held neither responsibility nor accountability toward a larger collective .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.07022"}

{"text": "\" Taylor 's notion of repertoire , as embodied knowledge / practice , is useful for understanding oral history as a form of \" embodied memory , because it is live , and exceeds the archive 's ability to capture it . \"Critically , Taylor argues that like the archive , the repertoire is also mediated .Unlike performance studies , in oral history the \" oral \" is burdened by the \" history , \" which bears the traces of the weightiness of officiality , rules of evidence , and the pressures of positivism .Perhaps oral history is a hybrid that fits somewhere in between the archive and the repertoire , depending on how the narrator narrates , how the listener listens , and how the researcher wields the apparatus of objectivity that records or captures this performance .Ultimately , it may come down to how much we listen to the embodied practice of memory and the shifting conditions under which knowledge can be shared rather than reduce that memory performance only to a transcript to be studied .I am attracted to Taylor 's beautiful conceptualization of the repertoire because it represents the gestures , tones , and sighs - the literal performance of memory , how narrators rock themselves when they talk of difficult memories , how we stop the tape when tears flow .In this way oral history as performance is part of the repertoire ( and its transcript belongs to the archive ) .An added dimension of the word repertoire is that it is used by social movement scholars to refer to the range of strategies and tactics that social movement actors use to create and contest meaning , power , and representation .I argue that memory is also part of the repertoire of the excluded , politically marginalized , and specifically the colonized .Structures of remembrance construct an archive of knowledge as well as a Chicana / o structure of feeling that narrate belonging and create a sense of legacy that shapes the horizon of political possibilities .Oral history is part of this repertoire of remembrance and shares a political tradition with Latin American testimonio .It is never the same twice , it is specific to time and place , and it relies on the alchemy between oral historian and narrator .Maylei Blackwell is Assistant Professor in the C\u00e9sar E.
