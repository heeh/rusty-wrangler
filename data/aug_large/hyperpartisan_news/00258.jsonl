{"text": "While people may say that public officials should be held to a higher standard , in fact the public is loathe to see a first lady , a president or a vice president prosecuted unless there is incontrovertible proof that they have committed serious crimes .But there 's no indication the public wants to see the vice president indicted for these transgressions and almost no chance that a Washington jury would convict him if he were indicted .But perhaps the most compelling case against the appointment of an outside counsel to investigate these matters is that it would likely remove the issue from public debate and judgment , which is where it belongs .Once an outside counsel is appointed , Gore could get away with stonewalling questioners by saying it would be improper for him to comment on an ongoing investigation .Evidence could only dribble out through leaks , which Gore would try to turn to his advantage .If Al Gore truly has nothing to hide , he 'll press the Justice Department to release all documents related to this investigation -- including every internal memo calling for appointment of a special counsel .Since this is n't likely to happen , the press should play its traditional role in ferreting out and publishing information .Voters must play their role , too .In the final analysis , they are the jurors in this case , and Nov. 7 is judgment .day .Last week , word leaked that yet another Justice Department official has recommended that Attorney General Janet Reno appoint a special counsel to investigate Gore 's involvement in illegal and questionable fund - raising activities .Robert J.

Nazarbayev .Within days of the visit , Mr. Giustra 's fledgling company , UrAsia Energy Ltd. , signed a preliminary deal giving it stakes in three uranium mines controlled by the state - run uranium agency Kazatomprom .It also reported that several months later , Mr. Giustra had donated $ 31.3 million to Mr. Clinton 's foundation .[ ... ] [ T]he ultimate authority to approve or reject the Russian acquisition rested with the cabinet officials on the foreign investment committee , including Mrs. Clinton - whose husband was collecting millions of dollars in donations from people associated with Uranium One .Romney , in his interview with Hugh Hewitt , explained that because Bill and Hillary are married , their assets are co - mingled .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.974014"}

{"text": "But this is one of those scandals that you have to believe in in advance in order even to be able to see it .Not being one of the faithful myself , I find the Downing Street memo a ludicrously inadequate peg to hang a scandal on and nothing at all like ( to change the figure ) a smoking gun .Moreover , it was obvious to anyone with eyes to see as early as the summer of 2002 that President Bush was planning to go to war in Iraq - which is why I wrote what I called \" the conservative case against \" the war in August 2002 .It would have been astonishing if people in the White House were not being at least as assiduous as I was about preparing their case for the war .Or , as a hostile observer might put it , \" the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy \" - as indeed they are around every policy that has to be sold to the public .That 's how these things work .To find in that fact alone evidence of bad faith on the part of the administration is like saying that a defense attorney is guilty of bad faith for not making the prosecution 's arguments as well as his own .But of course it is not just this that makes Bush , in the eyes of his detractors , guilty of bad faith .They start from that assumption , as they have done almost since he was first elected and the most fervent among them began blithely accusing him of having \" stolen \" the election .In doing so , they themselves were fitting the facts to the policy , though in the view of most non Bush - haters , I suspect , with even less plausibility than the President made the case for war .There is another reason , I think , why they are putting so much faith and emotional energy into a dud scandal , and it is suggested by Mark Danner in a piece in the most recent number of the New York Review of Books .Virtually nothing of great importance remains to be revealed .\" Comparing these new \" scandals \" to Watergate and more or less all the scandals since , he goes on to discern a trend .What distinguishes our time - the time of September 11 - is the end of this narrative of scandal ....So we have had the revelations ; we know what happened .What we do n't have is any clear admission of - or adjudication of - guilt , such as a serious congressional or judicial investigation would give us , or any punishment .Those high officials responsible are still in office .Indeed , not only have they received no punishment ; many have been promoted .And we - you and I , members all of the reality - based community - we are left to see , to be forced to see .And this , for all of us , is a corrupting , a maddening , but also an inescapable burden .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.48784"}

Rick Perry , most of the Republican establishment and right - wing press have deliberately mischaracterized the nature of the criminal allegations .They all are marching lock - step in an effort to defend official abuse of power by pretending that the violation was due to the execution of a veto , something that is entirely permissable by a governor in Texas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.97286"}

's Public Integrity Unit , Perry was attempting to force his will on Lehmberg .Even worse , he was actually doing harm to the people of Texas who rely on that agency to keep politicians ( like Perry ) from engaging in corruption .It is typical of right - wing media to absolve Republicans of any criminal wrongdoing on a strictly partisan basis .It 's the reason why every investigation of a conservative is portrayed as political .I could go on and on and ... .Perry 's fate will rest on a jury 's decision of whether or not he exceeded his authority in threatening Lehmberg to resign , not on the veto he used as his muscle .In the meantime , the media is also on trial , and when Fox News and others misrepresent the facts in order to whitewash the crime , they must be judged guilty as well .If it seems to you that that President Obama has been under an investigative microscope since the moment he took office , it 's only because that 's pretty much true .Republicans were determined to foil anything positive that this president placed on his agenda , and their primary method of achieving that end has been perpetual investigations of trumped up scandals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.713066"}

{"text": "Actually , it 's a very interesting Russian phenomenon why all friends of Vladimir Putin who wants to be in business they became billionaires so soon .My third example also comes from the world 's energy resources .In Russia , a company called Trasneft has a monopoly on the transportation of oil .According to the official records , Transeft not only a transportation monopoly but also the biggest charitable donor in Russia .They give half - a - billion dollars in charity over to U.S. Sounds good , indeed , but the problem is that no one knows who received the gifts .After exhausting considerable efforts we were able to locate just two recipients of these mysterious charities .One of them is Kremlin Line Foundation ( ph ) .Kremlin Line was created by the former secret service officials and we have uncovered sufficient ground to allege that this so - called charity is just a fraud through which Transneft pays bribe to secret service - ( inaudible ) - when Transeft want to squelch an investigation .This strategy is works for them - works for them .In our case we spent two years pressing the interior ministry to investigate this classified charity .After several months when the ministry had a deadline to announce the result of the investigation the representative came to the hearing and said , oops , we lost the file .There is no case anymore .And of course it was a huge scandal , we sued them successfully and we forced them to start an investigation again .A couple of weeks ago when another deadline came and they were supposed to announce the result of investigation the representative came to the hearing and said , sorry , we lost the file again .Of course , this will set up a huge scandal so our work at least accomplished that .Transneft still operates in shadows and is still hiding the identity of the recipient of the so called charity .But our litigation drew attention to the cover ups so the government was pressured into reinforcing our rules of transparency for Transneft .The company has been forced to disclose their own incrimination - even more incrimination information about their work .So we managed to use the system against the system to protect investors ' interests efficiently .I described just three , very typical , examples of the corruption among the dozens we are investigating .So why does it matter for you ?Corruption in Russia effects share pricing for shareholders around the world which hurts corporate portfolios and the retirement funds of little American guy .It also made a hit to your tax base and your economy because U.S. funds have invested billions of dollars in Russian companies .Not only do we fight to reduce the damage suffered by American and other investors but our work , also , draws attention to human - rights violations .When we expose corruption officials try to hide their tracks .At times some of them have resorted to violence and degradation to protect their careers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.50824"}

Bush , the reverse was true .The things that are supposed to go up actually went down and the things that are supposed to go down , went up .President Obama and the Democrats are trying to replicate the Clinton era , which was the longest economic expansion in peacetime ever in American history .The GOP , meanwhile , would prefer to keep the Bush years going .The Republicans are n't exactly going around campaigning with placards adorned with the face of our 43rd president .But their top economic priority is to extend tax cuts enacted under Bush , especially those for the top 2 richest percent of Americans .Obama 's own treasury secretary , Tim Geithner , spelled out the choice in a speech this summer in Washington . \" In the 1990 's , sound fiscal policies led to large surpluses and important investments in the middle class , which helped contribute to a period of strong growth and job creation , \" Geither said , before describing the fiscal failures of the subsequent Bush years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.2323"}
