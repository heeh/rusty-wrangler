'Michigan 's stalking law has been used to silence dispute when it comes to politically charged speech such as pro - life protest .\" What happened to Mr. Pouillon sounds bad enough .With its current definition of domestic terrorism , the USA - PATRIOT Act offers several opportunities for opening Pandora 's box .This should be of serious concern to political activists , particularly those who are advocates of causes such as property rights , gun owner rights , traditional family values , and pro - lifers .Conservative activists have good reason to feel reasonably safe that the Bush Administration will be prudent in its use of the domestic terrorism provision .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.516052"}

'Cause it sounds more like a Catholic pep rally than a pro - life protest . . . .Today , at the opening session of the 2004 Republican National Convention , the Delegates voted to accept the report of the Permanent Committee on Resolutions ( Platform Committee ) by acclamation .Phyllis and I have spent the past week working to ensure that the pro - life plank remains strong and unchanged and we were successful once again .Family Research Council had a very strong presence here in New York as well , and contributed to the outcome of the plank dealing with the issue of homosexual marriage as well as the life issues .Gary Bauer also came in to do media interviews and assist with the Platform work .The 2004 Platform carries the unequivocal support of the Republican Party to the policy that marriage in the United States is a contract between one man and one woman .However , the language dealing with embryonic stem cell research is not satisfactory .In fact , an amendment calling for a ban on research that involves the killing of human embryos was prevented from coming to a vote , and Platform Committee Chairman Senator Bill Frist made a lengthy speech about why embryonic research must , in his opinion , continue .So , from the perspective of the fate of the human embryo and efforts to make the platform consistent with respect to the fundamental right to life , we still have a lot of work and education to do !Here in New York and indeed , on the talking - head shows during the past few days , we have been bombarded with suggestions that former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani may be the Republican nominee in 2008 .Others are suggesting NY Governor George Pataki .Both of these men are strongly pro - abortion and , as such , they can not achieve the presidential nomination of the Republican Party , as their pro - abortion predecessors former Gov. Pete Wilson and Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter discovered in 1996 .THE LIFE OF THE PARTY PARTY Our party is oversold by nearly 200 people !Once again , the pro - life event will be one of the best and most popular parties of Convention week .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.789764"}
