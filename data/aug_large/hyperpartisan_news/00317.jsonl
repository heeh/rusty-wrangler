{"text": "Rather than try to fix this fundamentally flawed system , the United States needs broad reform in the area of nuclear waste management , which at its basis requires giving nuclear waste producers responsibility for nuclear waste management .Modernize the regulatory process for new nuclear power plants .Though today 's reactors are very safe , new reactors have the potential to bring Americans even safer , clean , abundant , and affordable energy .One of the obstacles to nuclear investment , however , is an antiquated system for nuclear regulations .The nation needs a regulatory system that allows the introduction of new technologies into the marketplace .By being largely capable of regulating only one reactor type , the NRC essentially blocks new technologies from competing with existing ones .The NRC needs a more neutral approach to regulation that invites more market competition .A Greater Concern : Getting the Lights Back On .While uproar over the nuclear energy sector was misguided , concern over the electrical infrastructure was very realistic .Hurricanes generally cause widespread power outages , particularly in highly populated areas .Hurricane Sandy was no different .The widespread outages caused by Hurricane Sandy along the New Jersey coast and Long Island impacted all three parts of the power system - generation , transmission , and local distribution .Inland , the impact was almost entirely on the local distribution system , as wind and rain combined to down hundreds of individual power lines .As with most hurricanes , the largest cause of outages from Sandy was due to damage to distribution systems .This network of substations , transformers , and distribution lines delivers electricity to individual customers .Above - ground distribution systems are especially vulnerable to widespread outages because high winds and heavy rain combine to cause branches , and often entire trees , to fall onto the lines .Even lines that are not snapped by falling branches or trees can still short - circuit when the electric line comes into contact with branches .Moreover , in some cases , the wind and rain combine to knock down the distribution poles themselves .When a distribution line short - circuits , the sudden change in power flow can damage transformers located along the line , or at a substation .( Transformers adjust voltage to the level at which an individual business or residence can be served . )In some cases , transformers can catch fire or , in worst - case situations , explode .With this in mind , a common reaction to outages caused by hurricanes is often to call for burying distribution lines underground .Although underground distribution lines are immune to the effects of wind , undergrounding has drawbacks .In addition to the high cost , underground distribution lines are especially vulnerable to flooding .Thus , when a hurricane like Sandy causes significant flooding , underground distribution systems can suffer extensive damage .In Lower Manhattan , for example , some underground transformers flooded with corrosive sea water , rendering them nonfunctional .This was only aggravated by the fact that Hurricane Sandy made landfall at high tide , causing its particularly destructive storm surge , and resulting in even more significant flooding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.5633"}

{"text": "5 ] The more declarations issued , the faster the DRF needs replenishing .If FEMA reserved the DRF and its resources for nationally catastrophic disasters , the need for emergency spending would drop significantly .The pace of FEMA declarations has increased with each new President .In just eight years , President George W. Bush issued nearly as many FEMA declarations as Presidents Reagan , George H. W. Bush , and Clinton combined .In 2011 alone , President Obama issued more FEMA declarations than President Reagan did in eight years and President George H. W. Bush in four years .Is it any surprise that the DRF keeps running out of funds , thereby requiring emergency appropriations ?The increase in disaster declarations is largely a result of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988 ( Stafford Act ) , the controlling federal statute for disasters .Under this act , the federal government pays 75 percent to 100 percent of disaster response bills as long as FEMA has issued a disaster declaration .Meeting the requirements for such a declaration is relatively easy : The disaster in question must be \" of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and the affected local governments and that Federal assistance is necessary .\" [ 6 ] The financial threshold is also low : \" when a state 's storm - related damages reach $ 1.29 per capita , [ which ] for several states ... is less than $ 1 million in damages .\" [ 7 ] The ambiguous provisions of the Stafford Act and low damages threshold create enormous incentives for governors to seek federal disaster declarations rather than shoulder most of the cost , especially during this time of tight state budgets .In order to prevent this situation from continuing in the future , Congress should : .Modify the Stafford Act to establish clear requirements that limit the situations in which FEMA can issue declarations .As the litmus test for federal disaster dollars , the Stafford Act fails to clearly establish which disasters meet the federal requirements and which do not .Congress should correct this ambiguity by establishing clear requirements that limit the types of situations in which declarations can be issued .This should include eliminating some types of disasters entirely from FEMA 's portfolio .One way to accomplish this is to align declarations with the various scales used for disasters ( such as the Saffir - Simpson Scale , the Richter Scale , and the Fujita Scale ) .Another way is to raise the minimum - dollar threshold for requesting disaster declarations .Doubling the per capita threshold to a minimum of $ 5 million ( and a maximum threshold of $ 50 million ) would significantly reduce the number of events that would warrant a federal disaster declaration .FEMA 's Operational Tempo and Lack of Preparedness .Nothing typifies the extent to which states rely on the federal government for disaster spending like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie 's ( R ) demand that the federal government essentially give him a blank check to deal with Hurricane Sandy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.84307"}

{"text": "Those things only seem to become possible and thinkable when it 's already too late .Donald Trump 's call for a ban on entry of Muslims , even if never implemented , has been worth it due to the hysterical reaction to it from his political foes .Words like Hitler , Fascist , and Racist were bandied about , as well as calls that he has disqualified himself from running for President .And that 's just from the Republicans .The Democrats are even more upset !Meanwhile , a lot of people are wondering why the heck we did n't do this right after 9/11 .The truth is that we did start to set the groundwork for it .The National Security Entry - Exit Registration System was set up in 2002 .It required extra screening , biometrics , and interrogation of people traveling to the US on visas from several category countries ( i.e. Muslim ) based on level of threat .Visa holders from these countries were required to register at ports of entry and ports of departure .So for a while , the government actually did what it was supposed to do .The program was mostly suspended in 2011 but it provided a guide that the government could actually do what it should have been doing in the first place .Unfortunately almost 3000 Americans had to die in a horrific terrorist attack committed by visa holders to take it seriously .But frankly I lean more toward Trump 's idea .That goes the NSEERS program one better .Why allow any Muslim immigration to the US ?What is the argument in favor of that ?The reason to oppose it seems obvious .Primarily , Islam and Western Civilization are incompatible .I ca n't think of a single Western nation that 's benefitted from Muslim immigration ; quite the contrary .Nor can I think of a single Muslim nation that is open to Western values .Turkey did try .I 'll give it that .Ataturk made a real effort to Westernize Turkey , but the call of culture , blood , and Allah was too strong for it , and now it 's sliding towards an Islamist regime .The NSEERS program provided a guide to how to do it .I would resurrect the Country categories : .Group 1 : Iran , Iraq , Libya , Sudan or Syria .Group 2 : Afghanistan , Algeria , Bahrain , Eritrea , Lebanon , Morocco , North Korea , Oman , Qatar , Somalia , Tunisia , the United Arab Emirates , Yemen .Group 3 : Pakistan , Saudi Arabia .Group 4 : Bangladesh , Egypt , Indonesia , Jordan , Kuwait .Resurrect the screening for tourist and student visas and basically prohibit any other visa categories , including fianc\u00e9 K-1 visas .Based on what happened in San Bernardino , if ever there was a case of looking for love in all the wrong places that was it .After months of confusion , anguish , insults , and bitter tears , the Wall Street Journal is finally beginning to understand the appeal of Donald Trump .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.91048"}

{"text": "After National Popular Vote series , we enter a world in which a national popular vote recount is real ... and terrifying .The inevitability of the recount scenario presented here should be obvious to anyone who thinks about it for five seconds ( thinking about it for more than five seconds is not encouraged ) .Presidential Recount Ends , but the Nation Remains in Chaos Five weeks after Americans cast their votes to elect the next president of the United States , real estate mogul Donald Trump has emerged as the candidate with the most popular votes .A long and bloody recount was necessary to establish Trump as the winner , though doubts still remain about the validity of the process .Neither of his two challengers , Senator Julian Castro and incumbent President Chris Christie , has conceded .In the final tally , Mr. Trump led Senator Castro by only 413,269 votes and President Christie by a more substantial 4,728,118 votes .He will be the first non - Democratic or Republican candidate to win the national popular vote since the Whig Party 's Zachary Taylor was elected in 1848 , and is almost certainly the least qualified president - elect of all time .These results deviate immensely from the original national popular vote count , in which President Christie led both candidates by a small margin of less than 100,000 votes .The unexpected shift came after the discovery of massive nationwide vote fraud , as was predicted by the 2012 Republican Party platform with Nostradamus - like accuracy .A significant number of the fraudulent votes were cast by one elderly Christie supporter who had managed to register all of the thousands of dead cats she had owned over the course of her life to vote .In addition , millions of new votes for both Castro and Trump were discovered on the streets and rooftop gardens of Brooklyn after the floodwaters that had covered New York and Connecticut following Hurricane Xena retreated back into the sea .During the original counts and subsequent recounts , state governments were forced to ignore their ordinary duties in order to focus all of their resources on determining who received the most votes nationwide on November 3rd .Many state governments are expected to have tripled their debt during the recount , and several requested emergency federal monetary relief .In the absence of any law enforcement , large swaths of America are now believed to be controlled by gangs , town council members - turned - petty dictators , and the National Rifle Association .One of the states to suffer most during the recount was Kansas , which had been bombarded with litigation after its decision to keep Senator Castro off the ballot and was forced to count an unprecedented number of write - in ballots .The number of court cases in Kansas so far outstripped the capabilities of its judicial system that most ballot disputes were ultimately decided by pistol duels in the streets .Controversy also surrounds the state of Alabama , which refused to accept the legitimacy of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and has consequently withheld its election results in protest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.53482"}

{"text": "State Defense Forces in Disaster Response .Like the National Guard , State Defense Forces ( SDFs ) played an important role in the response to Hurricane Sandy .Unlike the National Guard , however , these forces are largely made up of volunteers from local and state communities and are often composed of retired service members and reservists , along with other professionals , such as doctors , lawyers , and engineers , seeking to give back .Many members , therefore , have high levels of training and professionalism stemming from past experience that makes them invaluable for high - risk states , acting as force multipliers for response efforts in the aftermath of natural disasters or domestic attacks .SDFs also have the advantage of being from , and thus understanding , the local area and culture .Additionally , they report to the governor of the state , and are generally under the command of the adjutant general , so they do not face the legal barriers that national forces sometimes face in deploying to states .Perhaps what is most important , though , is that each state can tailor its SDF to meet specific needs .While New York needed a naval militia to assist with its homeland security needs , New Mexico , for example , can focus its SDF on state needs such as border security and forest fire response .While not authorized to deploy outside their home states except under special circumstances , SDFs in some of the hardest - hit states , such as Maryland , New York , Virginia , and Connecticut , were activated to assist in the Sandy recovery efforts .As with the National Guard , many more militia troops were prepared and ready to serve their communities than were actually needed , but this is exactly the problem a state would want to have during a crisis .The Maryland Defense Force ( MDDF ) deployed one Disaster Assessment Team ( DAT ) in Salisbury ahead of the storm , and had two more DATs and four medical teams on standby that were never required to activate .The MDDF 121st Engineer Regiment was deployed to Salisbury as well as a medical team from the MDDF 10th Medical Regiment , which assisted a Maryland National Guard transportation team .Other MDDF personnel served in support roles at the State Emergency Operations Center and the Joint Operations Center at Camp Fretterd .Almost 70 MDDF personnel contributed 2,430 man hours to recovery efforts in the state of Maryland .Brigadier General ( MDDF ) Brian R.
