'Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Demick bases her account on seven years of interviews with North Koreans who escaped to South Korea .Along with their personal stories , Demick includes background information on the Korean War and the dictatorships of Kim Il - sung and his son Kim Jong - il .The author also examines the great famine that killed millions of North Koreans in the 1990s .In one unforgettable scene , Dr. Kim , having crossed a river into China , sees that dogs in China eat better than human beings in North Korea .In addition to the physical hardships is the psychological stress of living under a rigid totalitarian government where a chance wrong word overheard and reported by a neighbor can mean imprisonment or death .Demick shows the state ofmind of each of her subjects , what their daily life was like , how they coped and eventually how each escaped .She also reveals her subjects struggling , sometimes unsuccessfully , to adapt to life in South Korea .Meticulous reporting reveals life in a country that tries hard to keep its citizens walled in and the rest of the world out .Agent : Flip Brophy / Sterling Lord Literistic .From the Publisher . \" The narrow boundaries of our knowledge have expanded radically with the publication of Los Angeles Times correspondent Barbara Demick 's Nothing To Envy : Ordinary Lives in North Korea ....Elegantly structured and written , Nothing To Envy is a groundbreaking work of literary nonfiction .\" - Slate . \"Excellent ... lovely work of narrative nonfiction .... a book that offers extensive evidence of the author 's deep knowledge of this country while keeping its sights firmly on individual stories and human details . \" - New York Times . \"A deeply moving book . \" - Wall Street Journal \" Superbly reported account of life in North Korea''- Bloomberg \" There 's a simple way to determine how well a journalist has reported a story , internalized the details , seized control of the narrative and produced good work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.601643"}

A-1 , 9 . \"DILI , East Timor -- Multinational troops searched house to house for suspected militiamen in East Timor 's village capital yesterday , as new reports emerged that entire towns in the hinterland have been emptied of people and torched . 'We should be celebrating the birth of an independent nation , but instead we are witnessing a baptism in blood ' , Amnesty International said in a report on East Timor .The human - rights organization said tens of thousands of people were forcibly deported from East Timor by the Indonesian army .In the capital Dili , about 1,000 multinational combat troops , backed by armored personnel carriers and two Blackhawk helicopters , sealed off several city blocks yesterday in a huge display of force .\"[ Note that Amnesty International is a front organization for the New World Order Plan].Later in this article , we learned that the United Nations ' peacekeeping force was coming from Australia , The Philippines , and Canada .Over 3,000 troops are already in East Timor as of this date , with a total of 7,500 expected to be deployed .While no one can justify the atrocities being committed by Indonesian troops against these civilians , and while the Indonesian government asked the United Nations to intervene , we have every right to be extremely concerned by the United Nations intervening in yet another country .Yes , Indonesia authorized the United Nations to intervene , but that does not change the fact that this situation is very serious and has extremely serious consequences for all the rest of the world in the not - too - distant future .As we have reported in earlier articles , the Illuminati re - drew the map of the world in 1952 .They sectioned off all countries of the world into patrolling zones , each of which would be patrolled by troops foreign to the peoples living within each zone .Thus , the Illuminati took a page directly from the Communist playbook .You see , Lenin and his leadership cadre realized very early in the implementation of Communist rule in Russia that troops could not be expected to be cruel and merciless to their own people .However , they would be cruel and merciless to people who were not their own .Therefore , Lenin rearranged his army so that Muslim troops patrolled non - Muslim areas , while non - Muslim troops patrolled Muslim areas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.63072"}

{"text": "And although 2012 delivered little good news for Canadian oil and gas producers , there is at least some hope that political considerations will force policy - makers to make real progress on the approval of new pipelines .On Thursday , Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall , along with 10 U.S. governors , inked a letter to President Barack Obama , urging him to \" move forward on the Keystone XL Pipeline project . \"\" The energy relationship between the United States and Canada is vital to the future of both our countries , \" reads the letter .\" It is an interest we share , transcending political lines and geographic boundaries .\" The benefit for Mr. Wall , according to a government press release , is that the pipeline would \" move growing American conventional oil production from the Bakken Formation to market , thus easing pipeline capacity for all jurisdictions that share this dynamic oil play , including Saskatchewan .\" It also makes political and economic sense for the United States .Exports to the United States are expected to reach four million barrels of oil per day ( b / d ) by 2020 , which would significantly reduce America 's reliance on oil from undemocratic , and often unfriendly , countries in the Middle East and South America .Keystone XL would also create thousands of much - needed jobs on both sides of the border .Keep in mind , Canada is expected to double its production from three million to 6.2 million b / d by 2030 , and Keystone XL will only add 500,000 b / d in new capacity .At the same time , China and other Asian countries continue to develop at a rapid pace , making it imperative that oil sands producers find a way to bring their product to this emerging market .The best and safest way to transport bitumen to the Pacific is to increase the capacity of the existing Trans Mountain Pipeline and to follow through on Enbridge 's proposed Northern Gateway pipeline .Building a new line to the West Coast , however , has seen significant opposition from environmentalists , First Nations and politicians .The ferocity of the opposition was on display this week during ongoing hearings in B.C. .Five protesters were charged with assault and trespass after disrupting a hearing in Vancouver on Tuesday .A protest organizer told the CBC that the process \" is becoming increasingly less democratic , \" even though many of the people speaking at the hearings oppose any new pipelines .Environmentalists - who are largely determined to halt oil sands production at any cost - have co - oped the process .Of course there are also political roadblocks that need to be overcome before any shovels can hit the ground : Namely , Ms. Clark 's demand that B.C. receive its \" fair share \" of the profits from the new line .However , fear that Adrian Dix , who is opposed to the new pipeline , and the NDP could displace the Liberals in the May 14 provincial election has given Ms. Clark some unlikely allies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.53946"}
