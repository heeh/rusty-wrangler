{"text": "Best Hollywood Studios Table Service Restaurants .Best Hollywood Studios Sit Down Table Service Restaurants Disney World .Of all the theme parks that make up Walt Disney World , the Hollywood Studios is known to have the worst dining choices .While it 's unlikely you 'll be blown out of the water at any of the Studios ' table service restaurants , it 's not too difficult to find a decent meal if you know where to look .While the frugal should avoid the costly Hollywood Brown Derby and anyone with taste buds should reconsider Hollywood & Vine , the three middle - of - the - road restaurants all have something to offer .Hollywood & Vine is n't terrible for breakfast either and the Hollywood Brown Derby may be an oasis for someone looking for a relaxing , higher end meal .Knowing what to expect , managing expectations , and finding the right fit for your group is the key to a successful meal .With that , let 's have at it .Be sure to read over the full reviews for more information on any of the restaurants listed .You can either click here for the full list in alphabetical order or click the individual highlighted links throughout this post .Almost everything on the Hollywood Brown Derby 's menu is a unique recipe with costly ingredients and an interesting presentation .You wo n't find grouper , bean and vegetable ragout , sashimi grade tuna tartar , or asparagus soup anywhere else at Disney .The rest of the table service restaurants at the Hollywood Studios offer familiar foods , with Mame Melrose getting the slight edge .You 'll find a variety of unique flatbread pizza combinations as well as spicy Italian sausage and eggplant napoleon .The 50 's Prime Time Caf\u00e9 serves familiar comfort food like meat loaf , fried chicken , and pot roast and the Sci - Fi Dine - In features hamburgers , sandwiches , ribs , and pasta .Both of these restaurants would be excellent with unadventurous eaters .Hollywood & Vine is your standard buffet with a selection similar to what you would find at a casino or chain buffet restaurant .The standard carving station , bread basket , ice cream station , and salads all make appearances , as expected .Best \" Value \" AKA Most Expensive Meal on the Disney Dining Plan .Mama Melrose 's ( Average Entr\u00e9e Cost $ 17.06 , Average Dessert Cost $ 5.87 , Most Expensive Entr\u00e9e Cost $ 27.99 , Most Expensive Dessert Cost $ 6.99 , Most Expensive Entr\u00e9e + Dessert + Beverage $ 37.98 ) .Sci - Fi Dine - In Theater ( Average Entr\u00e9e Cost $ 16.28 , Average Dessert Cost $ 6.95 , Most Expensive Entr\u00e9e Cost $ 22.99 , Most Expensive Dessert Cost $ 7.99 , Most Expensive Entr\u00e9e + Dessert + Beverage $ 35.67 ) .50 's Prime Time Caf\u00e9 ( Average Entr\u00e9e Cost $ 18.18 , Average Dessert Cost $ 5.54 , Most Expensive Entr\u00e9e Cost $ 20.99 , Most Expensive Dessert Cost $ 7.49 , Most Expensive Entr\u00e9e + Dessert + Beverage $ 33.48 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "26.081034"}
{"text": "At this point , you might be wondering , \" what 's the catch ? \"Well , to take advantage of this wonderful offer , you only need to sit through an obligation - free 30 minute timeshare presentation hosted by - I'm only kidding .There is no catch .First , there 's the obvious .If you want to dine at nicer restaurants on a budget , order water instead of soda or alcohol , order cheaper entrees , and split meals .The same types of things you can do anywhere to save money .Rather than waste your and my time elaborating on these rather pedestrian common - sense tips ( apologies to those short on common sense who could have used further elaboration ! ) , here are some concrete tips for items to order to save money at specific Walt Disney World restaurants : .Hollywood Brown Derby ( menu ) - The Hollywood Brown Derby is one of the best restaurants at Walt Disney World , but unfortunately , it 's also one of the most expensive .However , you can dine at the Brown Derby for just a bit more than it would cost to eat at a counter service menu and you can order two of the Brown Derby 's most popular menu items .For $ 22 per person , you can order the Famous Cobb Salad ( on the appetizer menu ) and the Grapefruit Cake ( dessert ) .The Cobb Salad at the Brown Derby is colossal and contains a kitchen sink of awesome ingredients .Seriously , if it were sold at Beaches & Cream , it would simply be called \" Kitchen Sink Salad .\" I 'm not typically a salad fan , but this Cobb Salad is amazing , and incredibly filling .The Grapefruit Cake is n't as filling or large , although it 's still sized well , but it has a very unique flavor and is one of the Brown Derby 's signature items .For $ 22 per person plus tax and tip , you will get a chance to dine at one of Walt Disney World 's nicest restaurants and you 'll leave full .Compared to the $ 80 or more you can easily spend per person when dining here for a full meal , this is a great way to sample the ambiance and two of the best menu items at the Brown Derby !Le Cellier ( menu ) - Le Cellier has three great lunch menu items that you should consider when trying to dine on the cheap , all of which have great reputations : the Canadian Cheddar Cheese Soup , Le Cellier House Burger , and BLT Salmon Sliders .I do n't really think any of Le Cellier 's dessert 's are mindblowing , so I 'd probably go with the Canadian Cheddar Cheese Soup and the BLT Salmon Sliders .Total , this is just over $ 20 .If you want to dine cheaper and you really like dessert , consider a bowl of the soup and the Maple Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e ( it 's good , just not any better than what you 'll find anywhere else , in my opinion ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.05017"}

{"text": "Based on my experience , it was priced right for a mid- to high - end Disney restaurant .Experience : For those of you who enjoy Disney attention to detail when it comes to history and themeing , this restaurant will be perfect for you .From the caricatures on the wall , to the replicated art deco decor , to the tiny brass derby hat lampshades , you 'll feel as though you 've walked into the golden age of Hollywood .Rich maroon booths wrap around white tablecloths , servers anticipate your needs , and you really do feel like a bit of a celebrity .Kids - unless yours are experts in design - wo n't care about this place , and might even find it boring .Adults , though , should feel pampered .Food : As is often the case with Disney 's signature restaurants , the food is exquisite .This is the kind of meal you savor .While we were n't wild about the desserts ( they 're often a bit too \" pre - packaged \" for us ) , we 'll be talking about the wonderful meal for a long time .Overall : Book it .Go now .I 'm ashamed to say that it took me as long as it did to try this restaurant .It 's absolutely worth the cost , and I would probably pay a bit more .The ambiance is lovely ( though it can get loud and echo - y ) , and the service was good .This is worth a trip - or two - to the Studios .We 're lucky to have such a great spot available right in the middle of a theme park .Sci - Fi Dine - In Restaurant Cost : Again , this is another restaurant in the Studios serving big meals for little prices .There are three lunch menu items under $ 15 and nothing over $ 23 on the dinner menu , including the steak and seafood meals .Cost is similar to 50 's Prime Time Cafe .Experience : The imagineers have done it again .This place does n't just have themeing - it 's an attraction in itself .You sit in cars to eat .You 're underneath a starry sky .1950 's carhops wait on you .You watch clips of black and white , mid - century monster and zombie movies while you eat .And that 's not all .When you wander out to the restrooms , check out the drive - in movie props , movie posters , and little Disney details lining the walls of the \" studio .\" Food : The menu is short and standard : ribs , shrimp and pasta , burger , chili , milkshakes , etc .But they do have a tofu dish and a steak dish , at least .And the food is n't bad at all .It 's not a five - star meal , but it 's not take - out , either .In fact , in my experience , the food here has gotten a lot better than it was about 4 years ago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "42.94643"}

Motors !Action ! auto stunt show and Walt Disney : One Man 's Dream .The Walt Disney show is a walk - through exhibition followed by a short movie about Walt 's life , and rarely attracts a wait .Enjoy it at your convenience later in the day .Check the day 's show schedule for auto stunt show times and plan to arrive 20 - 30 minutes early to get in line for seats .That leaves Star Tours , for which you should get a Fastpass time once you 've eligible to get another one after collecting your previous Fastpasses .( Of course , if you show up at an attraction to get a Fastpass and find a standby wait of under 20 minutes , just go ahead and get in the standby line to ride now .Or , get the Fastpass first and bank it for a re - ride later in the day ! )Theme Park Insider readers prefer the original version of Fantasmic ! , which plays at Disneyland in Anaheim , over the Disney 's Hollywood Studios version .If you 're looking for a free souvenir and a unique hands - on experience , visit the Animation Academy in the park 's Magic of Disney Animation pavilion , to learn how to draw a Disney character , that you can take home with you .Visit Theme Park Insider 's Disney 's Hollywood Studios page for a list of other attractions in the park , which you can enjoy at your discretion during the rest of your day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.397865"}

{"text": "In late June , Clint Eastwood 's efforts to turn the hit Broadway musical Jersey Boys into a successful film failed to light up the US box office .But Begin Again , a musical romantic comedy starring Keira Knightley , opened to quite solid business despite being exhibited in only five cinemas .It still faces an uphill battle : looking back over the past year there are several musical films that have failed and only one , Frozen , that was a major triumph .Bringing musical films to the big screen is a business fraught with difficulty .At one time , during the golden age of the Hollywood musical from the 1930s to the 1960s , the genre was a confident staple yielding entertainment with a worldwide following .After all , who can forget Gene Kelly in Singin ' in the Rain or Julie Andrews bursting into song in The Sound of Music ?But since 2000 there have only been a handful of big screen musicals that have really succeeded .Chicago , Dreamgirls , Mamma Mia , Les Mis\u00e9rables and Moulin Rouge are the ones that immediately come to mind .Among the more notable casualties are Nine , The Phantom of the Opera and Rent - which all had been initially presented on stage .For musical theatre and film historian John Kenrick the right talent has to be in place for a musical to do well - a case in point is the Oscar - winning film adaptation of Chicago in 2002 .\"[ The ] people involved in Chicago had solid backgrounds in musical theatre and film .The director Rob Marshall had been a Broadway choreographer long before he attempted to film Chicago , \" he says .Kenrick believes that so many musicals fail because the directors who take them on do n't have the right skills .\" What 's happened is [ that ] far too many people do n't understand that musicals are a very demanding art form - and it 's practically impossible for any filmmaker to suddenly make a successful musical when they have absolutely no background in doing so .\" That is perhaps one reason why Jersey Boys stumbled .Clint Eastwood 's track record includes directing the Bird ( 1988 ) , a musical biopic of American jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker .But Jersey Boys was a far more elaborate undertaking : an adaptation of the Broadway stage show that tells the story of the 1960s American pop group The Four Seasons . \"Jersey Boys has been , so far , a resoundingly unsuccessful project , \" says Wheeler Winston Dixon , Professor of Film Studies at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln .Dixon does n't point the finger necessarily at Eastwood , but he 's not alone in thinking that the director is n't one you 'd associate with this kind of project .\" Clint Eastwood directing a musical .It does n't really seem like it would be the most obvious choice , let 's put it that way , \" he says .Suspending disbelief ?It 's not just the talents of a director or a cast that determine whether a movie musical will work - there 's an ongoing challenge with the audience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.63727"}

{"text": "Bollywood fans have no problem with this aspect of the genre but audiences in the West often do .\" There 's something about musicals that is so inherently unreal , \" Dixon says .\" Most times you can lose yourself in a film , but if people are talking and all of a sudden they burst into song , it pushes you back , and you 're conscious that you 're watching a film - it 's difficult .\" Some onscreen performers share his view .\" I personally am not a musical fan , \" says actor Mark Ruffalo , who is one of the stars of Begin Again .\" I do n't [ dislike]them but I do n't go to see them , and so I 'm very sensitive to the idea of some[one ] bursting out into song all of a sudden .It 's kind of a little jarring to me .\" Ruffalo has a non - singing role in Begin Again , which is a musical film in which the singing is more naturalistic because some of the actors are portraying characters who are musicians .Ruffalo 's co - star Keira Knightley disagrees - she likes traditional musicals and thinks there is an audience for them .\" I think it 's very clear that Mamma Mia 's done very well - and they burst into song - and Les Mis did very well , so clearly I think young audiences do like that , \" says Knightley .Directors are sufficiently mindfulof audience concerns that they may try to disguise what they 're doing .John Carney , the Irish filmmaker behind Begin Again , who also wrote and directed the 2007 hit musical film Once , tries to avoid presenting his films as overly song - laden so as not to alienate audiences .\" I 've avoided that by doing what I 'm now calling the \" stealth musical ' , \" he says .\" You do n't realise it 's a musical until you 've left and your friend says , ' We just sat through eight songs ... that was a musical . 'I do n't think I 'd go necessarily to a musical if somebody told me that I 'd have to sit through all these songs , \" he adds .\" But if they 're well incorporated into the drama then they 're sort of disguised a little bit .Carney 's fans are impressed by the way he brings music and song into his films . \"He recalls scenes in Once where the two main characters , both musicians , might sing .\" They 'd be in a piano store and then they 'd play the song very naturally and it would n't be like someone launches into song randomly out of nowhere , \" he says .Broadway to the bank .Even though some audiences might be uncomfortable with the implausibility of the traditional musical there 's definitely a significant demand for them - the box office performances of Les Mis\u00e9rables or Mamma Mia ! are testament to this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.26407"}
