Bush .Blocking government enforcement powers .The same budget bill contains dozens of antiworker riders to prevent the government from enforcing new regulations to improve worker protections .The NLRB introduced the rule to modernize the union - election process because the current process allows for manipulation of the timing of elections - leading to delays that can help cause elections to never occur .Thirty - five percent of the time that workers file a petition for an election , the election does not end up happening .The NLRB has scheduled a vote today on a portion of the rule - but the budget bill and standalone legislation authored by Rep.

{"text": "As well , the president 's appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were delayed by Republican opposition in the Senate and by the administration 's own unwillingness , first , to press for confirmation in a timely fashion and then to give recess appointments to the NLRB members .As a result , the five - member NLRB continues to limp along with just two members ( one Democrat , one Republican ) , unable to rule on any contentious issues .That said , the NLRB had few cases involving current organizing campaigns in 2009 , chiefly because there was precious little organizing going on .Last year , unions devoted their energy mainly to the legislative battles for labor - law reform , stimulus legislation , and health - care reform .They pressed the administration for executive branch rules changes that may make the task of organizing workers less Herculean and that will better the lot of low - wage workers whether or not they belong to a union -- efforts that may soon bear some fruit .The larger unions also were busy planning major organizing campaigns they would undertake if their reform bill , the Employee Free Choice Act , passed .Now , in the mordant words of one leading organizer , \" we 're trying to figure out what Plan B is .\" This is hardly what unions expected when they plunged more than a quarter - billion dollars into their efforts to help elect Barack Obama and other Democrats in the summer and fall of 2008 .The unions were the only element within the Democratic coalition able to mount a credible campaign for Obama in the sector of the electorate where his support was weakest : the white working class .Focusing on such relatively heavily unionized swing states as Ohio , Michigan , and Pennsylvania , they accomplished their mission : Unionized white men backed Obama by an 18 percent margin , even as nonunionized white men opposed him by 16 percent .The entire industrial Midwest ended up in Obama 's column .EFCA , which Obama had pledged to support , is designed to address a number of distinct shortcomings in existing labor law .Discharging a worker involved in an organizing campaign , or threatening to close or move a business if workers vote for a union , for instance , are forbidden by the current law , but the penalties are negligible , and such threats and firings have become routine .Employers can also delay elections for months if not years and compel their workers to attend one - on - one anti - union meetings with their supervisors .The bill passed the House last summer , then went to the Senate where , like all substantive legislation in the past year , it hit a wall .Tom Harkin , the Iowa liberal who chairs the Senate 's Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , quickly found that he could n't rally all 60 Senate Democrats for the bill that had passed the House .Working with five other Senate Democrats from across the party 's ideological spectrum , he developed a compromise proposal that abandoned the card - check proposal in favor of expedited elections and greatly enhanced penalties for employer misconduct .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.47824"}

Beck .Under Beck , an employee should be able to limit his or her payment to the union to his or her share of the costs of representation .The principle behind Beck is that workers should not be forced to pay for union lobbying or political work unrelated to the employer / employee relationship .Why is n't Beck enough ?Even in exercising Beck rights , an employee is still obligated to pay a union for services that the employee does not want .In addition , Beck rights have proven difficult to secure , as the union controls all the records needed to determine what employees should pay .Getting an accurate accounting often requires lengthy litigation .Ca n't workers get rid of a union that 's doing a bad job ?That 's easier said than done .Once a union is certified , it is difficult for employees to remove it .Decertification elections must wait until a contract expires and because of forced dues and fees , unions have large amounts of funds to fight attempts to remove them .This is one reason why most employees in unionized firms have NEVER actually voted in an election to certify the union that represents them .The union is simply entrenched and therefore has the ability to act in a manner that may be more beneficial to union leaders than to union members .Union officials in right - to - work states know that if they lose touch with their members , those members may simply start withholding dues and fees .This keeps the union more immediately accountable to the workers it represents .But do n't workers benefit from having a union ?Should n't they be willing to pay for it ?It 's not that simple .A union can hurt workers too .When a young worker is laid off or passed over for a promotion because of seniority , does he really benefit from the union contract ?An ineffective or unwise union can cost workers dearly .It 's naive to assume that all workers come out ahead from union representation .And once you account for that , the whole case against right - to - work basically evaporates .What has changed that makes right - to - work an issue now ?Michigan is in an economic crisis .Between 2002 and 2010 the state lost 14 percent of its jobs .States with RTW have proven attractive to companies desiring to locate in an area , and Michigan workers could really use the jobs those companies might provide .WORKPLACE .What would change at my workplace ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.928406"}

Hart Research Associates Poll .And 63 percent of working Americans reported that they joined together with co - workers to solve a workplace problem in 1997-the last year that question was asked - according to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press .In recent years the NLRB has protected the rights of nonunion workers to engage in \" protected concerted activity \" to improve wages , benefits , and working conditions in a number of prominent cases .In these cases , nonunion workers have filed charges against their employer and asked the NLRB to investigate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.871887"}

{"text": "The main principle of the bill was that all federally regulated workers should have the right to a free secret ballot vote when deciding to certify or decertify a union .The card check system that had apparently been in place for federally regulated industries required 50 % plus one of workers ' union membership cards for union certification .This system was open to co - workers and other interested parties potentially pressuring employees into signing union cards .Rather than an automatic certification of a union process , the previous bill required a 50 % plus one majority of votes cast in a secret ballot to support certification at a meeting for certification or decertification .The principle behind this is similar to what we all undergo here in a general election .Just as the secret ballot of a general election represents the voice of each elector , a secret ballot on certification would allow employees to freely express their wishes .Many Canadians do not want to reveal who they voted for in a general election .I am sure that members experienced that as often as I did when they were going door to door in the last federal election .Some people are quite free in expressing how they are going to vote , but many would rather keep that to themselves .Workers should be provided that same level of comfort in expressing their views , choosing to either express them publicly or to have the privacy of a secret ballot vote in the workplace , a place where they spend by far the majority of their time .They should be made to feel welcome and comfortable , no matter what their choice , in all circumstances .The bill ensured that there was a framework in place to allow those workers to express their personal position .One other change in the previous bill was the proposal to set the threshold of employee support required to trigger certification or decertification at 40 % .It was amended to 40 % so that the trigger was the same either way , which it had not been prior to this legislation .It would be the same for certification or decertification , the same to get in and the same to get out .This number is more reflective of international conventions and the majority of provincial statutes .In fact , five provinces currently have this threshold or higher .I believe this approach is fair and creates a level playing field for both supporters and opponents in situations where the question of certification or decertification is at stake .As I said before , the creation of the new legislation was about making sure that workers are able to express themselves as they deem fit in their workplaces , allowing both those who are opponents or partisans supporting accreditation or decreditation to express their views .As I have said , it makes sense to me that we use a system for the democratic rights of workers , but it apparently also makes eminent sense to workers .Polling data on unionized and non - unionized employees across the country shows overwhelming support for a secret ballot vote on questions of certification and decertification .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.617928"}

{"text": "When will it take care of the economy ?We have some serious issues that have to be addressed in this country right now .Mr. Speaker , it is an honour to follow my esteemed colleague regarding the Liberals ' intent to repeal Bill C-377 and Bill C-525 .Both of these bills were about transparency .As my colleague talked about earlier , the first bills we introduced as a government were about increasing transparency , and one of the first acts of the Liberal government is to introduce bills to reduce transparency .Bill C-377 had an important purpose .The purpose was to extend the principle of public disclosure to a group of institutions that enjoy substantial public benefit : labour organizations .This is key .Public disclosure would increase the confidence of Canadians that unions spend their money wisely and effectively .Regarding Bill C-525 , which dealt with the issue of voting rights , it replaced a system called \" card check \" .The card check system allows for a workplace to be unionized without allowing all employees to express their opinions .In fact , the unionization of a workplace could occur without a significant portion of the bargaining unit having been made aware of it .Again , both of these bills dealt with improving transparency .In our strong view , Canadian union workers have the right to know how their mandatory union dues are spent .That is why our government passed Bill C-377 and Bill C-525 .Repealing these laws sends a very clear message : the Liberal government cares more about thanking union bosses , who did everything in their power to help them get elected , rather than the thousands of hard - working union members whose dues were spent without consultation .Union leaders need to be held accountable and tell their members and the public how their tax - advantaged income is spent .The Conservative Party will continue to support union transparency and stand up for union workers .As I have said in a couple of my other speeches , it is becoming quite clear that the only party that cares about Canadian workers and workers ' families is the Conservative Party of Canada .Even some labour organizations are very strongly in favour of our bill .The Christian Labour Association , Dick Heinen , the executive director , in February 2014 , said : .Now fundamentally , CLAC believes in competition in the labour relations environment in Canada .We think that workers should have the right and be free to make their own choices when it comes to which union represents them or whether they want to be represented by a union at all .As well , John Farrell , executive director of the Federally Regulated Employers , Transportation and Communications , in his testimony to the Senate committee , said : .FETCO members prefer a secret ballot vote to a card - check system for the purpose of determining if a union is to become a certified bargaining agent for employees .A secret ballot vote is the essence of a true democratic choice and is entirely consistent with Canadian democratic principles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.49646"}
{"text": "This \" free association \" position focuses on the inherently coercive practice of demanding a sacrifice from all that benefit from a collective endeavor .Coercion exists when an individual objects to the purpose or activities of the collective , yet is unable to withhold their support .In the U.S. , a workplace becomes unionized when a majority of the employees in a bargaining unit petition for union representation .This \" 50 percent plus 1 \" method of determination almost guarantees the presence of a minority group that did not want a union .Further , in many instances a person gains union coverage by accepting employment at a worksite that is already unionized , without ever having the opportunity to vote for or against unionization .In a non - RTW state , a labor union and employer can agree to a union security clause that requires all covered persons to pay dues to finance collective bargaining activities .In such situations , someone seeking to avoid paying dues to the union has three options : exit their job , convince union leadership to negotiate an open shop , or persuade fellow workers to decertify the union .Given that the last two outcomes are hard to achieve , the most viable option for dissenters is to work elsewhere .Thus , the term \" right to work \" means , in its elongated form , the right to work in a unionized setting , and reap the benefits of collective representation , without having to contribute toward the cost of obtaining those benefits .And the benefits are indisputable .Depending on the occupation , unionized workers earn wages that are ten to forty percent higher than their nonunion counterparts .The positive differential for other forms of compensation , such as health care insurance and pensions , is even greater .Perhaps more important than economics , however , are matters involving justice .Nearly all union contracts feature an informal form of due process : a grievance procedure that ends in final and binding arbitration through which unions resolve disputes over the contract and employer discipline .As such , in most union settings an employer must show proof that a worker committed a wrongdoing in order to discharge them .By contrast , in a non - union setting workers are \" at will \" and can be discharged for any reason ( or none at all ) that is not proscribed by federal law .It is important to note these benefits , because while promoting free association and individual liberty sound noble , the use of such concepts to advance RTW legislation belie a less lofty motive : to undermine the economic and political power of wage - earners .As the financiers of the RTW program are well - aware , when workers act collectively they gain power at work and in society .In states that have passed RTW legislation , the wages and benefits of all workers , union and non - union , are lower than national averages .One reason is that the gains by unionized workers spill into the non - union sectors through the so - called \" threat effect \" : in the presence of a strong regional union movement , employers with a non - union workforce will raise wages and benefits to discourage employees from unionizing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.54531"}

{"text": "The difference between relationship unionism and the old business and checkbook unionism is that , in most cases , the union is acting in the interest of its members - it is n't just cutting deals and leaving the members screwed .That makes it better than the old style .Most of the leaders who engage in these relationships are very smart and committed people .They are progressive and they are building the labor movement through organizing and effective wielding of power .NO CHALLENGE TO POWER .The problem is that unionism built on personal relationships and personal political debt does not challenge the power relationship and does not take power away from the boss , or the politician , and redistribute it to union members .It essentially persuades the boss or politician that it is in his / her self - interest to act in a way that the union wants .The boss chooses to do it , and retains the power to choose otherwise at another time .Let 's face it : this may not be a terrible strategy when the labor movement is weakened , because we are too small and under attack .But it is a dangerous strategy if it is n't recognized for what it is .This approach can only be a stop - gap while we build our ranks and our capacity to mobilize members at the workplace and at the polls , or we will not change the relations of power , which must be our ultimate goal .There is a limited amount of power to go around .We only get some if we take some away from the increasingly smaller and smaller group that holds it now .A small number of labor leaders persuading a few members of that powerful group not to hurt us or , on rare occasions , to help a small group of us , is not going to change things in the long term .We must maintain our commitment to worksite - based mobilization and direct action organizing , which relies on the power of people to take collective action on their own behalf .It is this activity that alters the relations of power between workers , their bosses , and the government .In 1981 the police union in Burlington , Vermont shocked the city by endorsing neither a Democrat nor a Republican for mayor .The impact rippled , and independent and socialist Bernie Sanders won his first victory on a ten - vote margin .Now , twenty years and twelve elections later , Sanders is Vermont 's Congressman , so popular with the voters that the two major parties do n't usually bother to put up a serious challenger .Vermont unions have no trouble going outside the two major parties to endorse Sanders .His unabated devotion to labor 's cause cements a relationship of mutually high expectations : unions expect him to champion their issues , and he expects them to support him at the polls .But it 's not just that ; Bernie also leads by calling on unionists to stand up and fight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.91875"}

{"text": "In mid - February , 7,600 baggage handlers and ramp workers for Continental Airlines -- painfully aware that they were the lowest - paid handlers in the industry and that their four previous attempts to unionize had all fallen short -- finally voted to join a union .This was a more arduous achievement than it may sound .Under the byzantine provisions of the Railway Labor Act , which governs labor relations in the airline industry as well , workers seeking a union need to win a majority not just of those employees who vote but of all the employees in their unit .Worse yet , their unit is defined as everyone in their job category within the United States : The more than 2,000 Continental ramp workers employed at the airline 's Houston hub , for instance , could not vote to join the union on their own .In fact , says Jeff Farmer , the organizing director of the Teamsters , the union that the ramp workers voted to join , \" Continental has 47 stations across the country -- and we were able to reach out to all of them .\" That required a campaign on a scale that only half a dozen of America 's unions would be able to mount , and even by those standards , the Teamsters ' effort was extraordinary . \"A number of other unions congratulated us , \" Farmer adds .But the reason for the congratulations was sobering : The Teamsters ' victory was just about the only good news that American unions had experienced in the first year of Barack Obama 's presidency .In 2008 , unions had worked tirelessly for Obama 's election in the hope that a Democratic president backed up by a heavily Democratic Congress could change the law that made organizing American workers so difficult .With the upset victory of Republican Scott Brown in the race for the vacant Senate seat from Massachusetts , however , those hopes were definitively dispelled .The failure to reform labor law almost certainly means that that the half - century decline of unions in America -- from representing nearly 40 percent of private - sector workers at the midpoint of the 20th century to representing just 7 percent today -- will continue apace .It means that the corresponding stagnation -- and periodic decline -- in the incomes of working- and middle - class Americans will likely continue as well .But the failure of labor - law reform was hardly the only disaster that befell unions in 2009 .Amid the greatest economic downturn since the 1930s , many thousands of unionized manufacturing , construction , and public employees lost their jobs , sending the percentage of unionized workers to record lows .Public support for unions also plunged , with both the Gallup and Pew polls showing a decline in public support of between 15 percent and 20 percent over the past several years .( In the Pew poll , those who had a favorable view of unions declined from 58 percent in 2007 to 41 percent in 2010 . )Even the most basic expectations that unions had of the newly elected Democratic president and Congress were initially dashed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.07059"}

Ethics Commissio n , _ _ _Misc . 3d _ _ _ _ , 2010 NY Slip Op 20418 ( Suffolk Co. Oct. 9 , 2010 ) , effectively rejected this privilege at least with respect to an EMPLOYEE of the union and union members .Why ?The court reasoned that the leading case in this area , Seelig v. Shepard , 152 Misc .2d 699 ( N.Y. Co. 1991 ) , dealt with communications between members .The courts logic is difficult to comprehend .A labor relations privilege is designed to protect confidential labor relations information and it should make no difference whether the discussion with the union is being held with other union members or union employees .The policy reasons behind this privilege ( to encourage open and frank debate and to not chill union activity ) remain the same .Today , I rise in advance of leading a special order this evening , to offer a resolution supporting the rights of all workers , including federal employees and other public employees , and calling for an end to attacks on their ability to organize and to collectively bargain .There are only a few salient rights recognized by every democracy , such as freedom of religion and freedom of speech , and on that list always appears the right for workers to organize in order to bargain collectively with an employer .It has long been recognized that individual workers have little , if any , bargaining power sitting alone with an employer who has hired or could hire her .When unions organize workers , the ground becomes more level and economic conditions decide the outcome .Mr. Speaker , the American labor movement has been a major catalyst for the formation of a majority middle class in the United States by leading the way for improvements for all workers , which unions gain through collective bargaining .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.53613"}
