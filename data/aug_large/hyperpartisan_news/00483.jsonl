{"text": "Cheers , really appreciated .I think that you 're wrong about how different the terms patriotism and national pride are .To feel devotion or to support your country is indeed patriotism , but it stems from the pride you feel in you country .Patriotism is more than the act of giving your country you support and it has a long going for it .As for your point about it being a non - issue .I would say that you 're right in the sense that it has less of a dramatic impact than for example job losses , but that does n't mean that it 's not important .Many people these days feel alienated and unsure as to how to act regarding their own country .No matter what , that 's sad .The really awful part is that it can also drive people into the arms of extremist demagogues .The problem with patriots is they never content themselves with loving the British countryside or admiring our people and our achievements , they always want to dictate an adherence to an unblinking unthinking uncritical acceptance , even a glorification , of our State .Fuck that shit .Is the UK great ?Sure , we 're fucking brilliant !Have our governments ever remotely lived up to that ?Occasionally perhaps , but not often .And therein lies the problem .For some reason , certain people do n't seem able to distinguish between patriotism ( a love of one 's country ) and nationalism ( seeing one 's country as superior to another ) .Patriots do n't want uncriticical acceptance and glorification of the state - in fact it seems to be socialists , the defenders against the ' evils ' of patriotism , that preach starry - eyed devotion to the state .It is insulting for a patriot of any political hue to tied into the actions of the British state .Oh , and since the definition of a patriot is \" One who loves , supports , and defends one 's country \" and you believe the UK to be , in your words , \" fucking brilliant \" , that makes you a patriot . \"In Dr. Johnson 's famous dictionary patriotism is defined as the last resort of a scoundrel .With all due respect to an enlightened but inferior lexicographer , I beg to submit that it is the first . \" - Ambrose Bierce .Great a article and absolutely spot on .Let 's start by having St. Georges day a designated bank holiday , that would get the ball rolling and give us an outlet to officially proclaim our patriotism which I think would go a long way to making us patriotic again .Tom Puddy - Tom Puddy is a conservative libertarian currently studying a masters in legal history .His interests include culture , politics and anything else that strikes him as worth commenting on .Points to discuss : .Why are the English against showing feelings of patriotism ?Do you feel the lack of patriotism in England stems from the negative connotations brought about by extremist groups ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.569885"}

{"text": "Though I returned to my country as a little child I still know the words of the Ghanaian anthem , and I 'm in my late 30s now .I even learned the former Nigerian anthem ( we had a new one in the late 1970s ) while still in Ghana .It was that important to my folks .Not knowing the anthem of one 's country ( whether one was originally born in it or not ) is just plain lack of respect or ignorance - or both .As one of the respondents has posted , either make the athletes sing their country 's anthems or do away with the ritual altogether .there is no way that one will say i do n't know my country 's anthem , that 's a lie .In January 2008 , new lyrics to the Spanish national anthem , La Marcha Real , were revealed .The Spanish national anthem had been lyric - less since the death of dictator General Franco in the 1970s .But when the Spanish Olympic Committee heard fans of the English soccer team Liverpool FC sing the club 's anthem ' You 'll Never Walk Alone ' , it was decided that Spain too should have lyrics to its national anthem .Now , leave the Spaniards alone and go to other countries .Yes , the Italians sang their lungs out , may be because it is an easier national anthem ?OK , here is the exception : Mario Barwuah Balotelli ; son , of an immigrant , he was born in Sicily .Somebody made reference to the Serbian and \" British \" anthems ; both having political aspects .Not any different in the US , where players on the National Team have dual citizenship , were \" imported \" ( Tom Dooley years ago ) because the have US connections ?Do you really blame them for not singing the anthem ?Now , immigration issues aside , have you considered that some of these players , may be , ca n't sing ?My girlfriend recently became a British Citizen .In order to qualify she had to take a Citizens test and sing the national anthem .To represent any country is an honour , so why would n't you want to learn the words to the anthem .I think the Spanish really have to adopt a new anthem that will represent the nation in generality rather than having an anthem that has no wording .I would like to humbly recommend to the world governing body FIFA to make it mandatory for players to sing their national anthem before playing any official match .Nationalism means something different in every country , and each country fielding athletes in it 's name should be allowed to make it 's own regulations , based on it 's culture , politics , etc ..And yet , It thrills me every Olympics to notice that , though our athletes have no obligation to sing along , they usually do .In fact , they do so far more reliably than athletes from most other countries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.12079"}
