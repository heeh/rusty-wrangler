Romney needs to get his message straight , or he will be hammered in the general election over false promises .He calls for repeal of Obamacare while saying he would immediately issue an executive order to give flexibility to the states to implement the law their way .That sets the stage to massively confuse the political agenda : He would be sending the states off to begin to implement Obamacare while Congress works in Washington to repeal it .Further , the Congressional Research Service issued a report that said Obamacare 's major provisions are Acts of Congress , and they simply can not be changed through an executive order .His focus should be on repeal .Waivers to the states from Obamacare are not a solution and , in fact , might well detract from the ultimate goal of repealing the law and replacing it with a genuine free market alternative .If Gov. Romney is serious about repealing Obamacare , he will have to devote all of his energies to doing that as soon as possible .The House of Representatives passed a repeal bill a few weeks after Republicans took control last year .In the Senate , many parts of Obamacare could be repealed through reconciliation with only 51 votes should Republicans take control there , allowing them to enact legislation repealing the spending provisions that are the biggest threat to the economy and to the federal deficit .He also could calm voters by emphasizing that a federal mandate to purchase health insurance is unconstitutional and detail more reasons why Obamacare 's government - centric approach is wrong .Step 2 : Explain what really happened with passage of Romneycare .Gov. Romney 's support for states ' rights is important , saying the law worked for Massachusetts but that other states need their own solutions in our diverse and complex country .But conservatives would feel better knowing what he initially proposed in the Bay State .For example : .Few voters know that Romney wanted an escape from the individual mandate .Voters may be more forgiving if he were to tell them he wanted to give citizens a way out and that he strongly opposed the employer mandate .Romney wanted people to be able to purchase real health insurance that would have covered catastrophic events .Instead , the legislature insisted on including all of the 50-plus health insurance mandates already on the books .The legislature allowed the high - deductible plans only for some young people aged 18 - 26 .After the Massachusetts law was passed by the legislature , Romney continued to try to reshape it with his line - item veto .For example : .The bill called for a mandate on employers with 11 or more workers to provide health coverage or pay an annual fee of $ 295 per worker .Overridden .The bill included a provision that would allow some non - citizens to qualify for coverage under the new health plan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.250465"}

Heller , which held for the first time that the Second Amendment protected an individual 's right to bear arms .But Scalia was also an unvarnished , intemperate and intolerant ideologue , railing against same - sex marriage , voting rights , Obamacare , affirmative action and other progressive causes .The impact of Scalia 's death will be felt immediately in a number of pending high - profile cases , transforming anticipated 5 - 4 conservative rulings into 4 - 4 stalemates .Under the court 's rules , 4 - 4 decisions carry no precedential weight and leave intact the lower - court rulings under review .This means that proponents of affirmative action ( Fisher v. Texas ) , as well as public - employee unions ( Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association ) , can expect constitutional reprieves , because the circuit court rulings issued in their favor will be allowed to stand .It also means that supporters of abortion rights ( Whole Woman 's Health v. Hellerstedt ) and immigration rights ( United States v. Texas ) will have an easier path toward overturning adverse lower - court decisions .Scalia 's passing will also alter the prospects for overturning some of the court 's most conservative recent rulings -- not only on the Second Amendment but on campaign finance , environmental regulation and the constitutionality of the death penalty , among others .Politically , Scalia 's passing will unleash a pitched battle on two fronts : first , in the fight to name his successor , and second , as an issue in the upcoming presidential elections .In the coming weeks and months , we can expect to hear a rising and increasingly hysterical chorus of Republicans demanding that President Obama refrain from nominating Scalia 's successor .Indeed , if initial press reports are any indication , the trench warfare has already begun .But with roughly 11 months remaining in his term , Obama undoubtedly will move forward .Anyone he names will surely be more liberal than Scalia , and anyone he names will tip the balance of the court .Those who remember the televised hearings on the nominations of Justice Clarence Thomas and former Solicitor General Robert Bork can expect clashes in the Senate Judiciary Committee ( which conducts hearings on Supreme Court nominations ) that will make those bygone proceedings seem genteel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.25194"}

Bush in 1990 appointed Justice David Souter to replace Justice William Brennan , who was among the most influential liberal justices in history , Bush 's chief of staff promised that Souter would be a \" homerun \" for conservatives .But Souter did n't line up with conservatives like Scalia and Thomas and , over time , became a reliably liberal vote -- providing a key vote to uphold abortion rights , for example .But Souter , whose prior service on the New Hampshire state Supreme Court had n't provided many clues about how he 'd rule on national issues , may have been the last such appointment .Today both parties vet their appointees much more carefully .Conservatives actually adopted the motto \" No More Souters .That does n't mean appointees always vote in ways that please the parties that appointed them ; Chief Justice John Roberts has infuriated Republicans twice in the last few years by voting to uphold the Affordable Care Act , Obama 's signature domestic policy achievement .Overall , however , the justices that end up on the bench these days vote in the ways that the presidents who appointed them hoped .There have been only four Democratic appointments total since 1967 , \" David Strauss , a law professor at the University of Chicago , noted on Saturday .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.280685"}

{"text": "A Democratic majority could start a similar shift back in the other direction .Gathered from select Twitter , Wikipedia , SCOTUSblog , and Google searches , here is a Supreme Court FAQ of what happens next following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia .Most of the information below was culled from this incredibly helpful report by the Congressional Research Service .Q. How does Justice Scalia 's death affect cases the court is in the middle of hearing ? A. They proceed as if nothing happened , unless the Chief Justice instructs differently .Q. Since there are only 8 judges for a time , what happens to cases where the judges tie , 4 - 4 ?A.The decision of the lower court stands , but does not hold weight as if it were precedent laid down by the Supreme Court .The risk of 4 - 4 ties is not unusual ( though is obviously higher now ) , because Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself from a number of cases that she worked on while serving as Solicitor General prior to her confirmation .Some scholars are also suggesting they can hold the case until a nominee is confirmed .But this has to happen before the end of the session in which the case was heard .Q. What 's the longest it 's taken to confirm a Supreme Court justice ? A. It depends on how you look at it .From nomination to confirmation , the longest time taken to confirm was the 125 days before Justice Louis Brandeis took the bench in 1916 .But the longest vacancy on the court ( meaning time elapsed between a judge stepping down and their replacement being named ) happened during John Tyler 's administration ( 1844 - 46 ) .It took him two years to replace Justice Henry Baldwin , who died in office .President Obama has 342 days left in office .Q. How long will it take President Obama to nominate a replacement ? A. No one knows , obviously , but his record on the two judges he has nominated ( Justice Kagan and Justice Sonia Sotomayor ) offers a glimpse .Obama took about a month to nominate Justice Kagan after Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement .He took 26 days to nominate Justice Sotomayor after Justice David Souter 's retirement plans leaked to the media .The problem , of course , is that both Justice Stevens and Justice Souter announced they would retire at the end of the Court 's term , so a vacancy was n't technically created , unlike in this case , where Justice Scalia 's death happens mid - term .That , combined with the approaching election , could expedite Obama 's nomination .Q. How can the GOP - controlled Senate block an Obama nomination ? A. Obama submits his nominee to the Senate Judiciary committee .Of the 114 nominations submitted to the committee since its creation , only 8 times have they not submitted the nominee to the full Senate for hearings + a vote .The committee can also delay the time between the receipt and the start of confirmation hearings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.044426"}

Chuck Schumer ( D. ) in 2014 .Obamacare , said Schumer , \" made no political sense .Also note that 8.6 million is a far lower figure than the number of people currently enrolled in Obamacare - sponsored products .Elsewhere in the latest Budget and Economic Outlook , CBO stated that \" average monthly enrollment of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries was ... 9.6 million [ in 2015 ] compared with 6.1 million in 2014 . \"Adding that to exchange enrollment gets you to roughly 24 million people on Obamacare - sponsored products .The Obama administration often boasts about that much larger figure , claiming that 24 million people have been helped by Obamacare .But the government 's official estimates are that it 's under 9 million .Of which only a fraction can vote in the 2016 election .Compare that to the number of people whose plans have been canceled ( 6 million ) , or the number of people who 've had their premiums or their taxes hiked ( dozens of millions ) .And that 's why Obamacare remains gravely vulnerable to repeal .This is frankly inescapable from a political perspective .If people are n't happy with the law , it does n't stay forever .The arguments about entrenchment seem much weaker in 2016 than they did in 2013-especially as states continue to refuse to expand Medicaid , a decision that frankly has n't been much of an issue on the national or local level .Tag Archives : George W Bush . 1980 56 % Carter Reagan 35 % .1984 61 % Mondale Reagan 37 % .1996 72 % Clinton Dole 21 % .2000 62 % Gore Bush 43 35 % .( After 6 yrs as Gov , Bush trails Gore by 27 % ) .2004 58 % Kerry Bush 43 40 % .2008 67 % Obama McCain 31 % .About 2.6 million illegals were amnestied in 1986 ( over a million the number projected ) , but only one fourth voted for Bush 41 in 1992 .Bob Dole supported amnesty , but he got 21 % , the lowest of all .If the Amnesty Bill is passed , it is projected that the estimated 11 million that will be legalized could be as high as 20 million , according to various sources .With those facts and the Republican Party 's track record in mind , here is George W.

'If he thinks this was unconstitutional but found a way to uphold it to preserve the integrity of the court , then he really ought to resign . \"After the biased House voted for contempt on Eric Holder , the Justice Department announced it will not bring criminal charges .So Geraldo was on to discuss it .Geraldo said this : \" I do n't know why anyone is surprised by that .I do n't understand for the life of me how Darrell Issa and his committee could expect this to result in a criminal indictment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.64821"}
