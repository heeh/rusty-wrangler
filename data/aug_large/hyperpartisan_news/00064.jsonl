'[ British immigration law demands that individuals acquire a visa to \" work \" in the UK .The quartet was not being paid .] I had flown a day earlier than the rest of the group to see a friend , so I arrived there by myself and the first thing I got asked by the immigration official was : ' Can I see your plane ticket ? 'So I handed her my itinerary , and she said , ' How come there 's two tickets ?Where 's the other passenger ?As soon as she said that I thought this is going to be a long day because this agent did n't know anything about buying an extra seat for instruments , so I had to explain that to her .OK , so , here 's my favorite part : The agent also claimed that she did n't know what a string quartet was !I was n't quite sure if she was faking it . . .to see what kind of response I would have .What are you doing here ? 'They took my luggage and searched it , and took me upstairs , and put my luggage and cello in a separate room and put a tag on it that I still have on my cello case - all it says is A13582 .I mostly sat there all day and they took me in for periodic questioning .They were trying to get in touch with my colleagues in the U.S. , but it was 3 a.m. , and they were all asleep , so they could n't get in touch with anybody .They asked me a lot about the group and the group 's business and things I did n't know the answer to .Everything I said or did n't say was deemed suspicious because of that .Also , the group 's previous cellist was listed on the program for the concert , which made them extra suspicious .They eventually got a hold of my colleagues and they said , ' Do n't bother flying over here because you 'll run into the same thing . 'But they decided to come anyway !When they got to customs , they changed their wording a bit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.83926"}

Sundowner Offshore Services , Inc. , the Court said that harassment based on sex is the key .Thus , a female supervisor who discriminates against female subordinates because she prefers to work with men is guilty of violating Title VII , and vice versa .Can sexual harassment ever amount to a criminal offense ?Absolutely .Any sexual assault , from rape to simple uninvited groping , violates various provisions in the State criminal code .The statute reads , .\u00a7 14 - 118.4 Extortion .Any person who threatens or communicates a threat or threats to another with the intention thereby wrongfully to obtain anything of value or any acquittance , advantage , or immunity is guilty of extortion and such person shall be punished as a Class F felon .Despite this new air of , well , respectability , the conference is a free - for - all - heavy on alcohol , black hats , and off - color talks .This is not out character for a hacker con ; one of my favorite presentations from HITBSecConf this year started with painful language lesson on picking up a prostitute in Malay .Once you got past that ( oh , and the \" fisting \" references , too ) , there was some great information .Get the picture ?Recently , I trolled someone on Twitter who said would n't attend DEFCON or Black Hat , because he preferred more secure , vetted environments .The comment is all kinds of stupid , because a convention like DEFCON is exactly where people who want to understand attackers should go - namely , anyone responsible for defending networks and hosts .However , there is no doubt that these conferences can be a hostile environment for a lot of professionals - not the least of which are women .Let it be known that I went to Defcon with a reasonable amount of armor on already .I was reasonably aware of the frat party environment I was stepping into .I have many friends who are involved with helping make Defcon roll smoothly each year , from speakers to goons .And still , nothing could have prepared me for the onslaught of bad behavior I experienced .Like the man who drunkenly tried to lick my shoulder tattoo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.59674"}

{"text": "But when they say , \" weenus \" ( which is the word they sort of made up and like to use ) I do n't say , \" Do n't say weenus ! \"In fact sometimes I say , \" Did you wash the weenus ? \" But when talking about medical issues or whatever , I say \" penis \" .I 'm not sure it 's the term that 's so important , but rather the fact that everyone feels okay talking about it and that there is n't any shame on the actual word .This all comes from the last generation 's use of terms like \" down there \" and \" dirty parts \" and terms that implied there was something wrong or secretive about the vagina , in particular .Most of all , we just want kids to know that whatever they call it , it 's okay to talk to us about it , and that it is n't shameful or secretive or dirty .I sort of feel the same .I 've heard so many people say to use the correct medical terms but it feels so awkward to me when talking to my toddler .Then I realized I do n't call her stomach an abdomen , I say tummy .I 'm not trying to hide the word from her or make it taboo .So I usually say pee pee for vagina , I 'm not trying to hide the technical term from her or imply it 's bad .I think if I feel awkward calling it her vagina she might pick up on my discomfort , which might imply more than using a babyish term for it .There is a case where a little girl told her teacher , an adult touched her ' cookie ' and her disclosure was sadly dismissed .That is a good point , thank you .I had n't thought of that .I think pee pee is a common enough term that most people would know what she 's talking about , however , I should make an effort to make sure she knows the correct term , even if we sometimes say pee pee as well .I knew one mom who would chastise other moms for calling their daughters ' vulva \" wee wee \" or \" privates \" - but she would say , \" Call it a vagina !It 's a vagina !\" I 'm like , \" Actually that part is n't the vagina , so stop being so sanctimonious .\" If the kid wants to call it a wee wee , I 'm really not against it as long as she knows it 's a vulva so she can be accurate if there 's a problem and knows there 's no embarrassment to it .I think telling her not to say \" wee wee \" is like telling her to say \" stomach \" instead of \" tummy \" every time , you know ?I have no evidence of this , but as a parent I do think there can be some damage if you are constantly correcting your child from saying the word they use .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.201485"}
