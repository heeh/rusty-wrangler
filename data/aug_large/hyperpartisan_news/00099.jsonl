Fordham Institute , a number of textbooks present an uncritical celebration of the free enterprise system .They downplay or even ignore legitimate problems in capitalism and the role government played in the growth of the American economy of the 1800s .A number of U.S. History textbooks suffer from a general lack of attention to the experiences of Native American peoples and cultures and sometimes include biased or misleading information .One textbook includes a biased even offensive treatment critical of affirmative action , including cartoons that jokingly suggest space aliens would qualify .Most textbooks offer scant coverage of the movement for LGBT equality , one of the salient civil rights struggles of the last half - century .One publisher links the gay rights movement of the late 1960s to society \" spinning out of control .The movie argues that the observant are being forced to practice in private , for few hours in church on Sundays .But on a personal level , ca n't you observe your religion wherever you want ?Not necessarily .You ca n't pray in school , but it 's good to have prayer .Are people offended by prayer ?Sure .But the constitution gives us the right to offend .There are a lot of things today in America that offend me .Right , but is n't school different ?There are lots of rules in school that do n't apply to the rest of society .This is a fallacy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.23981"}

'Huckabee 's resentments date back to his 2008 presidential bid , which drew dismissal and even paid attacks from a Wall Street - backed GOP establishment that favored Mitt Romney and others and saw Huckabee as suspect on taxes . \" ' I 've been on the receiving end of some of that when I ran for president .A lot of the establishment types were very contemptuous toward me and treated me like some backwater , ' Huckabee said .

{"text": "For Conservatism , small government is ideal not only because it adheres most closely to the intent of the founding fathers ( conserving past ideals ) but because it best serves the public .Big government is not only more prone to corruption , it takes away more money in taxes , is slower to accomplish its goals , attracts people more interested in the power and wealth it controls , and is unconstitutional from the Conservative perspective .A smaller government will be more responsive to the people , ideally , and less intrusive into citizens ' lives .To a Conservative , wealth is something earned by someone , even if it is passed down to subsequent generations .That money is theirs , it belongs to them just like a car that was purchased or given to a son .Further , that money is used by the wealthy in ways that benefit everyone else - None take money and sit on it without ever buying anything , few are stingy and miserly with their cash , they prefer to actually spend it to enjoy their wealth .When this money is spent , it is spent on goods and services that less wealthy people offer , thus giving it to those who need the money more .For a Conservative , this economic pattern is how the market benefits those in need as well as those who have much .A Conservative sees the needy and poor as people who may require assistance to make a new start or to get on their feet and earn a living , but not as people who should be given handouts .Such a pattern is viewed as corrosive and destructive to society .Further the tendency of Conservatism is to consider it not the job of government to help such people but the job of families , churches , private organizations , and individual citizens .For the Conservative , government 's role is very narrow , and private roles are very broad .Government deals with defense , other nations , trade , and basic services like roads , police , fire , and so on .Government handles the things that individual citizens have neither time or ability to - things that groups of citizens would handle by setting up shared organizations to do anyway ( like private police forces ) and all should benefit from .Conservatism does not view people in groups but as a whole , as citizens rather than minority segments .The majority , rather than the minority , is the primary concern of the Conservative .Demands or the will of small groups must always be considered in the light of the whole of the citizenry , not based on their weakness or lack of say in government .Conservatism embraces religion more easily than Liberalism because religion is strongly defined by what one may not do in addition to what one must do .Laws , concerns of sin , judgment , and condemnation are not uncomfortable topics to the Conservative because they are strong , ethical concerns and virtuous living is a high priority .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.08603"}
