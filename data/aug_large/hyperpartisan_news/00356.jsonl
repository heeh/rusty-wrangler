{"text": "The book focuses on what is and is not recognizable , achievable , and actually won by and for feminist politics in Germany , but my aim is to illuminate more general processes of feminist transformation .The differences among systems as to which claims are radical and realizable emphasize politics as a struggle rooted in historically developed material and cultural conditions .WHY GERMANY ?The German case is distinctive in several ways .Most importantly for my argument , Germany is not a liberal state .Many of the ideas Americans find obvious , such as the central role of individual rights and equal economic opportunity in allowing women full participation in all the goods society offers , owe their prominence to the dominance of liberal political philosophy .Liberalism has not played as important a role in Germany as in the United states or even Britain .German politics has drawn on both conservative views of patriarchal authority and social democratic ideals of justice to forge a social welfare state that prioritizes family support and the social reproduction of the nation .This difference in the material and cultural meanings of the nation - state shapes the work cut out for feminists .Thinking about a nonliberal political context offers a way to theorize the differences in the struggles faced by women 's movements around the world .Germany is not a dominantly social democratic state like Sweden , nor an insistently secular one like France .After World War ii , West Germany called itself a \" social market economy , \" but the principles guiding its development owed more to Christian conservatism than to social democracy , and east Germany was created as a communist state .German social democrats have been more organized and influential than classical free - market liberals , but they have more often than not been in the political opposition ; explicitly Christian parties led the government in the West , and authoritarian socialism dominated in the east .Policies that encouraged women 's paid work and reduced the gender wage gap were much more difficult to realize in West Germany than in its Nordic neighbors , and east German policies that embraced gender - equality goals were discredited by their association with repressive government .The German struggle over a balance between religiously based conservatism and social democracy provides a model for thinking about feminism in many parts of the world .Where social democrats are presumed to be an ally , many of the priorities and struggles in women 's movement politics will be affected in ways that are unfamiliar , and hence neglected , in American theorizing about political mobilizations .Germany is also a federal state . its central government is limited in many ways , and its states have different traditions . in particular the states that were part of the formerly communist German democratic republic ( GDR ) are more secular and ambivalent about socialist legacies .They are now subordinate to a larger , more prosperous , powerful Western section that kept the name , nearly all the laws , and the self - concept of the federal republic ( FRG ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.49754"}

{"text": "The biggest winners of the elections were Chancellor Merkel 's center - right Christian - Democrats .They won 41.5 % of the vote - far better than in the 2009 general elections , when they had 33.7 % .The biggest losers were the Liberals .The German Liberal Party FDP , which is economically to the right of Merkel 's CDU , fell from 14.6 % in 2009 to 4.8 % .The electorate punished the FDP , which had promised its voters tax cuts but , despite forming a government coalition with Ms. Merkel , failed to deliver on this promise .Although the FDP won over 2 million of the 43.7 million votes , as the party was unable to make the 5 % hurdle , and as a result it did not get a single parliamentary seat .The same applied to the conservative Alternative fuer Deutschland party ( AfD ) , a newly established party , critical of the euro .AfD won 4.7 % of the vote , an unexpectedly high result for a new party , but not a single representative .The far - right NPD won 1.3 % .Taken together , 10.8 % of the electorate voted for a party to the right of Merkel 's Christian - Democrats , but not a single parliamentarian to Merkel 's right got elected .Merkel 's Christian - Democrats , the FDP , AfD and NPD combined won 52.3 % of the vote ( 51 % , excluding the far - right NPD ) .However , in the Bundestag the parties of the Left - SPD , Greens and the Communists of Die Linke - hold 50.7 % of the seats .That the FDP fell just below the electoral threshold deprives Merkel of the possibility to form a center - right coalition .In any event , Germany 's new coalition will be to the left of the previous CDU - FDP coalition , while the voters had clearly indicated that they wanted Germany to turn to the right .The future looks promising , however , for AfD. Never before has a party that was established barely a few months before , done so well in the elections .And given that Merkel will be forced to move to the left , the prospect of disenchanted conservative Christian - Democrats flocking to AfD are huge .There is little doubt that AfD will gain seats in the European Parliament in next year 's European elections .If the AfD leadership manages to avoid internal quarrels , in 2017 the party will likely enter the Bundestag .The Unpredicted Consequences of the German Elections .Because of the \" 5 % hurdle , \" Germany 's new coalition will be to the left of the previous coalition , while voters had clearly indicated they wanted German to turn to the right .The German elections had two important consequences , one predicted , the other one unpredicted .As expected , the number of Islamic members of the Bundestag , the German Parliament , has increased .The Christian - Democrat CDU of Chancellor Angela Merkel now has its first Muslim parliamentarian .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.84366"}

'There is also anger at the criticism being directed at London from other European capitals .One Downing Street figure says that if Britain were not supporting the camps on Syria 's borders , at least a million more people would be coming to Europe .And we should remember those who are n't even in the camps , those who have been forced from their homes but remain trapped inside Syria .To save lives , Europe needs to stop people from thinking that if they take the risk of trying to cross into the European Union , then they will be able to claim asylum .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.16373"}
