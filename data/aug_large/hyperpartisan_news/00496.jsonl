Reid 's remarks : .Americans believe Congress is broken .And it 's no mystery why .Political divisions in this chamber are so great they often prevent the Senate from performing even its most fundamental duties .The divisions are so great they have prevented this body from confirming presidential nominees - our constitutional obligation .These days , it 's no longer enough to be a qualified nominee .It 's no longer enough to have bipartisan support .And in the case of judicial nominees , it 's no longer enough to be reported unanimously out of committee .Last year , my Republican colleagues blocked or delayed scores of outstanding nominees .Why ?Because they want to defeat President Obama , who made those nominations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.20916"}
{"text": "He was right to call out the problem , but he was wrong that it 's a bipartisan issue .It 's fine for the president to be magnanimous , but the fact is only one party has systematically held hostage even the most basic tasks of governing in the hopes of making minor political gains .And that party is not the president 's .The nominations crisis that we face today exists largely because it can easily fly under the radar - and the GOP politicians behind it know that .This Republican Congress 's intransigence has caused harm beyond the very public battles over the debt ceiling and tax cuts for millionaires .Under the unglamorous cover of judicial and executive branch confirmations , the Senate GOP has launched a campaign of strategic obstruction to prevent parts of the federal government from functioning at all .This became clear in the relatively public battle to confirm Richard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .Senate Republicans admitted they had no problem with Cordray himself .Instead , all but two stated in a letter to the president that they would refuse to confirm him unless the new , congressionally created agency he was nominated to head was first substantially weakened .It was an unprincipled attempt to legislate via the Senate 's power of advice and consent , which the president rightly sidestepped by installing Cordray with a recess appointment .But the Cordray nomination was just the tip of the iceberg .With far less public attention , the GOP has been decimating the nation 's courts , causing the judicial branch to face a historic vacancy crisis and Americans seeking their day in court to face unconscionable delays .This crisis is largely due to the chronic inaction of the Senate , which has been crippled by the Republican minority 's abuse of the chamber 's rules to block even consensus nominees from getting a yes - or - no vote .In his State of the Union address last night , President Obama addressed the unprecedented Senate obstruction of judicial and executive branch nominees and urged senators to end the nominations gridlock .Since Obama became president , the Senate GOP has conducted a steady campaign of obstruction against even entirely uncontroversial judicial and executive nominees .The statistics are unmistakable .Under President Bush , circuit court nominees waiting an average of 30 days for a vote from the full Senate after approval from the Judiciary Committee .Under President Obama , they have waited an average of 137 days .And district court nominees , who have traditionally been quickly and easily confirmed except under the most extraordinary circumstances have waited an average of 90 days for a Senate vote , compared to just 22 days under President Bush .The result has been a historic vacancy crisis in the federal courts , with over ten percent of seats vacant or soon to be vacant .PFAW 's Marge Baker issued a statement last night echoing the president 's call for an end to the obstruction : . \" President Obama is right to call for an end to such irresponsible and politically - motivated obstruction of his nominees , \" said Marge Baker of People For the American Way . \" For too long , the GOP has gotten away with its destructive agenda of obstruction , which has left more than 1 out of 10 federal judgeships vacant and resulted in unconscionable delays for Americans seeking their day in court .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.700104"}

Mike Lee of Utah : .Just two days ago , a senator from Utah promised to obstruct every single American I appoint to a judgeship or public service position - unless I fire the consumer watchdog I put in place to protect the American people from financial schemes or malpractice .For the most part , it 's not that this senator thinks these nominees are unqualified .In fact , all of the judicial nominees being blocked have bipartisan support .And almost 90 percent have unanimous support from the Judiciary Committee .Sen. Lee 's anger at President Obama for protecting the 99 % from the untrammeled power of the 1 % is no surprise .But it 's also nothing new for Senate Republicans , as noted in this U.S. News and World Report article by People For 's Marge Baker .Sen.

Republic of Iraq , 2004 ) .In an article written as a law student , argued that the phrase \" just compensation \" in the Fifth Amendment , which limits the government in the taking of private property , should be \" informed by changing norms of justice .\" This sounds like a nod to liberal constitutional theory , but Rogers ' alternative interpretation was more protective of property interests than Supreme Court law at the time .John Roberts Jr. and J. Michael Luttig have both marched up through the Republican ranks , from Supreme Court clerkships to White House jobs to the federal bench .Conservative activists in the Republican base view both as far more acceptable than Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who has become a top contender for the court , and have begun to promote the pair .But even though both judges are conservative -- and close friends -- they present a distinctly different choice in style and temperament that could influence their selection and say a great deal about how Bush wants to shape the court .In his years as a lawyer , Roberts , 50 , proved himself an affable and measured member of the Washington legal establishment .But his short tenure on the bench has meant fewer written opinions that can be parsed for his philosophy .Luttig , 51 , is edgier , painting his ideas in bold intellectual strokes .He has left a long paper trail that liberal critics will try to mine to fight his appointment .\" Roberts is known as a much more judicious person . ...Luttig would get certain people really jazzed up , \" said a former administration official who , like other lawyers contacted for this article , declined to be named for fear of appearing to take sides . \" For conservatives , Luttig is more exciting -- because he is more excitable .\" The decision clears the way for the Defense Department to use the commissions to try some of the hundreds of detainees in Guantanamo Bay .It was hailed by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as affirming President Bush 's \" critical authority \" to determine how to try detainees deemed \" enemy combatants \" in the war on terrorism .The ruling was an important test of the government 's strategy of denying such detainees access not only to civilian courts but to the more formal proceedings of military courts - martial , in which they would enjoy additional rights and legal protections .One of the judges on the deciding panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , John Roberts , is said to be on the administration 's list of possible nominees to the Supreme Court .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.51365"}
