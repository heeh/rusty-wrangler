Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958 , he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the US and the UK .Considering the response he received to his memorandum unsatisfactory , de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country .He wanted to give France , in the event of an East German incursion into West Germany , the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATO - Warsaw Pact war .In February 1959 , France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command , and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil .This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the air force bases that had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967 .Though France showed solidarity with the rest of NATO during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 , de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing France ' 's Atlantic and Channel fleets from NATO command .In 1966 , all French armed forces were removed from NATO ' 's integrated military command , and all non - French NATO troops were asked to leave France .U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk was later quoted as asking de Gaulle whether his order included \" the bodies of American soldiers in France ' 's cemeteries ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.09411"}

Eisenhower in January 1951 .The 1952 Lisbon conference , seeking to provide the forces necessary for NATO ' 's Long - Term Defence Plan , called for an expansion to ninety - six divisions .However this requirement was dropped the following year to roughly thirty - five divisions with heavier use to be made of nuclear weapons .At this time , NATO could call on about fifteen ready divisions in Central Europe , and another ten in Italy and Scandinavia .Also at Lisbon , the post of Secretary General of NATO as the organization ' 's chief civilian was created , and Lord Ismay was eventually appointed to the post .The German Bundeswehr provided the largest element of the allied land forces guarding the frontier in Central Europe .In September 1952 , the first major NATO maritime exercises began ; Exercise Mainbrace brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway .Greece and Turkey also joined the alliance in 1952 , forcing a series of controversial negotiations , in which the United States and Britain were the primary disputants , over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.821396"}
