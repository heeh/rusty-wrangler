{"text": "Floyd Mayweather to fight Andre Ward . in perfect world .Michael Woods , a member of the board of the Boxing Writers Association of America , has been covering boxing since 1991 .Floyd Mayweather Jr. is the best in the business today .He is a singular talent , a star shinier than any other when it comes to doing business in the squared circle .Now , he 'll sometimes tell you that he is the best in the business across the ages , the most talented person to ever lace on a pair .But he is a superior talent , a master craftsman , to be sure .If Floyd wants to be regarded as the best and the brightest , bar none , it would be helpful if his accomplishments compare and contrast favorably with the man regarded by a lion 's share of experts as the second - best boxer for the ages , Henry Armstrong .\" Hammerin ' Hank \" did his thing as a pro from 1931 - 1945 , and finished his Hall of Fame career with a final mark of 150 - 21 - 10 , with 101 KOs .He still holds the distinction of being the only fighter to simultaneously hold titles in three separate weight classes -- featherweight ( 126 ) , lightweight ( 135 ) and welterweight ( 147 ) -- and this during a time when there were only eight weight classes in total .In October of 1937 , weighing 124 pounds , Armstrong beat Pete Sarron to claim the world featherweight crown .In May of 1938 , Armstrong challenged and beat welterweight champ Barney Ross .The winner weighed 133\u00bd pounds , to 142 for Ross .Armstrong gave up 9\u00bd pounds and still scored a UD15 win at Madison Square Garden .But Armstrong was n't done .He knew Lou Ambers was holding the welterweight crown , so in his very next bout , in August of ' 38 , he met Ambers at MSG .Armstrong was 134 , and Ambers a half - pound heavier .At the end of the night , Armstrong had his hand raised , a winner by split decision .To boil this down , Armstrong hunted high and low for challenges .He looked left , right , up and down for people to beat to prove his mettle .One solid example of a modern - day warrior doing the same comes to mind , when Roy Jones Jr. jumped from light heavyweight to heavyweight to take on John Ruiz .Jones was 174\u00be when he beat Clinton Woods in September of 2002 , and weighed 193 when he fought and beat Ruiz , then the WBA champion , via UD12 .Ruiz was 226 pounds at the weigh - in , so he enjoyed roughly a 33-pound edge on fight night .I happen to think Mayweather stacks up quite nicely among the all - time greats .His genes contain matter that make him a superior fighter , DNA that the rest of the world does n't have .His defensive adeptness may not be equaled , and although he does n't possess the sort of power to score highlight - reel one - punch KOs , he does have enough pop to bother anybody on a given night .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.43884"}
