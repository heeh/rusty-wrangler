{"text": "Black students are more likely to be punished with suspensions , expulsions or referrals to law enforcement , a phenomenon that helps funnel kids into the criminal justice system .Meanwhile , white kids are more likely to be pushed into special education services or receive medical and psychological treatment for their perceived misbehaviors , according to a study released last week in the journal Sociology of Education .Overall , this pattern often leads to the criminalization of young black students and the medicalization of white students .The study , conducted by Pennsylvania State University assistant professor of sociology and criminology David Ramey , analyzed the rates of suspensions , expulsions and police referrals at 59,000 schools across the country .He also looked at how many students in these schools were enrolled in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 , two programs designed to help kids in need of special services .Ramey found that schools with larger populations of black students also had higher rates of suspensions , while schools with more white students had a greater number of kids in programs designed for students with special needs .Ramey offers a few explanations for his findings .For one , to qualify for special services under IDEA , students must be given an official diagnosis from a medical or mental health professional detailing why they need extra help .Schools are given with funds to provide these extra , costly services from the government .To receive special services under Section 504 , however , students must display a \" physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities \" but do n't need an official diagnosis .Schools do n't receive any funding for Section 504 , so they must draw from their own resources to help students .This helps explain why schools with high populations of minority students are less likely to place students into special education services , according to the new research .In addition , they study says many black families are \" skeptical of medical and mental health research \" because of the Tuskegee experiment , which involved researchers in the mid-20th century misleading and mistreating black men involved in a study about syphilis .Disadvantaged schools also tend to have more one - size - fits - all approaches to discipline , leading to high rates of suspensions and expulsions .\" Where the population is more educated , parents make more money , housing values are greater , those districts tend to give a lot of autonomy to their schools , \" Ramey told The Huffington Post .A more insidious hypothesis is that suspending low - achieving students or medicalizing kids with certain disabilities helps schools boost their test scores .\" Some scholars have suggested that both the suspension and medicalization may be responses to standardized testing , \" Ramey said .\" If you suspend kids while they 're supposed to take the test , they no longer count against the school 's score . \"\" Same thing with kids with borderline learning disabilities and putting them on medication , \" he continued .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "33.354336"}

{"text": "Racial profiling is also carried out in forms other than pretextual traffic stops .Enforcement of the controlled substances laws , in general , seems premised on the bizarre perception that drug trafficking is exclusively a minority - owned business .Drug - courier profiles have regularly included race as an explicit element of suspicion .In sworn testimony , DEA agents have at various times in recent years stated their belief that most drug couriers are black females , and that being Hispanic or black was part of the profile they used to identify drug traffickers .The immigration law context furnishes further evidence of widespread racial profiling .One of many examples of such targeting was \" Operation Restoration \" in Chandler , Arizona , a joint endeavor of the Chandler Police Department and the U.S. Border Patrol .According to a study conducted by the Arizona Attorney General 's office , local police and U.S. Border Patrol officials implementing Operation Endeavor \" without a doubt . . .stopped , detained , and interrogated [ Chandler residents ] . . .purely because of the color of their skin . \"Overall , nearly three - quarters ( 73.5 % ) of all of those deported by the INS are of Mexican origin , according to INS statistics , even though Mexicans constitute less than half of all undocumented persons in the United States .Hispanics constitute approximately 60 % of all undocumented persons , but well over 90 % of those subjected to INS enforcement actions are Hispanic .Racial profiling is seemingly inconsistent with today 's dominant law enforcement philosophy : community policing .But community policing is still a vague and elastic concept .At its best , community policing refers to a more diverse police force working with community institutions to prevent crime before it occurs .For example , Boston 's anti - gang efforts have featured after - school programs for high - risk students and a constructive partnership between the police and crime prevention agencies .In places where the police have consciously integrated themselves into the fabric of the neighborhood , community policing deserves credit for helping to reduce crime rates .But too often , community policing is just a label , a slogan to attract federal grants and favorable headlines .In some jurisdictions , community policing means little more than giving street level officers wide discretion to \" clean up \" the communities they patrol by whatever means seem expedient .Thus , community policing may come to mean \" quality of life \" policing , under which the police adopt a zero - tolerance approach to minor violations of law .Such an ends - justify - the - means approach invariably works to the detriment of - and is disproportionately targeted at - black and Hispanic populations .Professor David Cole has pointed out that such an enforcement strategy \" relies heavily on inherently discretionary police judgments about which communities to target , which individuals to stop , and whether to use heavy - handed or light - handed treatment for routine infractions . \"As Harvard Law School Professor and African - American Charles Ogletree has observed , \" If I 'm dressed in a knit cap and hooded jacket , I 'm probable cause .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.465744"}

{"text": "Stop and frisk \" entails the practice of temporarily detaining , questioning and patting down pedestrians based on an articulable suspicion that the detainee is involved in criminal activity .While \" stop and frisk \" is constitutional , it has not traditionally been used as a free - standing law enforcement strategy because in such a regime the discretion to choose who to stop is virtually unconstrained .Predictably , black and Hispanic New Yorkers were disproportionately targeted for \" stop and frisk \" pat - downs .Of the 10 police precincts with the most stops , seven were majority - black / Hispanic districts , and two of the majority - white districts were commercial districts whose census figures did not reflect the demographics for policing purposes , leaving only one majority - white precinct in the top 10 .By contrast , of the 10 precincts with the lowest stop rates , all but two were majority - white .The Attorney General also identified racial disparity in stop rates within white neighborhoods - in precincts that were approximately 90 percent white , more than 53 percent of the total stops were of blacks and Hispanics .Thus , more stops occurred in majority - minority precincts , and more stops of minorities than of whites occurred even in majority - white neighborhoods .The statistics were even more stark with respect to stops engaged in by the NYPD plainclothes Street Crimes Unit , which stopped 16.3 blacks and 14.5 Hispanics per arrest , but only 9.7 whites per arrest .Given racially disparate overall stop rates , these statistics reveal that far more innocent minorities are subjected to stop and frisk tactics than innocent whites .Some continue to defend racial and ethnic profiling by law enforcement as a rational response to patterns of criminal conduct .Such arguments rest implicitly or explicitly on two basic assumptions , each of which is flawed , pernicious , and divisive .The first assumption is that minorities commit the majority of crimes , and that therefore it is a sensible use of police resources to focus on the behavior of those individuals .This attitude was epitomized by Carl Williams , Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police until his dismissal in March 1999 , who stated in defense of racial profiling that \" mostly minorities \" traffic in marijuana and cocaine .Superintendent Williams ' assumption , shared by many , is flatly incorrect with respect to those crimes most commonly investigated through racial profiling - drug crimes .Blacks commit drug offenses at a rate proportional to their percentage of the United States population : Black Americans represent approximately 12 to 13 percent of the U.S. population , and , according to the most recent federal statistics , 13 percent of all drug users .And for the past 20 years , drug use rates among black youths has been consistently lower per capita than drug use rates among white youths .Findings related to the \" driving while black \" phenomenon and other forms of racial profiling lead to the same conclusion .While black motorists were disproportionately stopped by Maryland State Police on I-95 , the instances in which drugs were actually discovered in the stopped vehicles were the same per capita for black and white motorists .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.33661"}
