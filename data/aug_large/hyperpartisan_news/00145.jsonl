{"text": "Confirming the state is a bastion of Hillary Clinton support , a new Quinnipiac Poll out this morning shows Clinton beating Republican John McCain in Florida if she ends up with the Democratic presidential nomination .A race between McCain and Barack Obama would be too close to call .The survey showed Clinton with the support of 49 percent of Florida voters and McCain with 41 percent .It showed McCain with 44 percent and Obama with 43 percent .Statistically that 's a tie , well within the margin of error .Among white working - class voters , Clinton ties McCain 45 - 45 percent in Florida .These same voters back McCain over Obama 51 - 34 percent in Florida .Peter A. Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute , said in a news release : .\" If the super delegates are looking at electability , these results could be a shot in the arm for Senator Clinton .No one has won the White House since 1960 without carrying two of these three swing states , Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania .And she clearly is running much better against Senator McCain than is Senator Obama , at least for now .There is no indication that Obama 's problems with white working class Democrats in the Ohio and Pennsylvania primaries have gone away . \" Many voters cite trustworthiness as the most important quality they want in a candidate .Clinton is found wanting in that department , but still does best in the matchups .She wins because she is seen as a strong leader who cares about people and can improve the economy .McCain 's age is a significant problem in the minds of voters as are his ties to President George W. Bush .He is seen as the least able to fix the economy and bring about change .The data indicates he needs to continue to try and put some distance between himself and President Bush , whose job approval ratings remain awful .From April 23 - 29 , Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,411 Florida voters .The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points .Other findings : .Demographics - Facing McCain in November , Clinton leads 54 - 37 percent among women , while he gets 45 percent of men to her 43 percent .They tie 45 - 45 percent among white voters , while she leads 80 - 11 percent among black voters . -In an Obama - McCain matchup , men back McCain 46 - 42 percent , while women split , with 44 percent for Obama and 42 percent for McCain .The Republican leads among white voters 50 - 36 percent , while the Democrat leads among black voters 83 - 8 percent .Favorability - Clinton has a 49 - 40 percent favorability rating .That means 49 percent have a favorable view and 40 percent unfavorable .Obama is 47 percent - 36 percent for Obama and McCain is 51 - 32 percent .Economy - The economy is the most important issue in their vote , 50 percent of Florida voters say , with 22 percent who list the war in Iraq and 10 percent who list health care .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "39.30451"}

{"text": "Odds To Win Popular Vote - This works just like the odds to win the election however winning the Electoral College and winning the popular vote are two completely different things mainly because you can win the popular vote but not the election .Still , odds for the popular vote are presented in the same format where either Candidate A or Candidate B wins .And without a spread / handicap , each side of the wager pays differently when a single dollar is wagered on one side versus the other .Look for the 2016 popular vote odds to become available within a month of the election date .Odds To Win A Particular Swing State - As we talked about previously , one state can make or break a campaign and therefore there is a lot of attention placed on particular states which could go either way ...Democrat or Republican .Each election is different but typically these wager revolve on bigger states which can actually impact the race significantly .Each state has different odds for Democrats or Republicans based on past elections , current polling , and registered voters in the state .Perhaps the best example of this wager was Florida in 2012 where Mitt Romney was better than a 2 to 1 favorite to win the state 's 29 electoral votes .Well , President Obama won Florida in 2012 thus winning a good chunk of money for anyone who bet on him to win the state because he was the underdog and a single dollar wager payed more than what was bet plus the original amount risked .Because so much goes into figuring out which way a state might go , or even if there is a possibility of it swinging to one side or the other , odds for swing states are not available until right before the election .Political Primary Odds - Leading up to 2016 there will be a lot of campaigning within both of the major political parties for nomination to be the next President of the United States .With that comes betting odds on each party 's primaries in big states where it is not already known who will be selected to represent the party in the upcoming Presidential Election .Back in 2012 , Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney went head - to - head for several weeks for the Republican nomination until Santorum finally bowed out , clearing the way for Romney to seek election .In 2016 , both parties will be selecting a nominee so the action should be much more intense than in 2012 .Look for odds to win state primaries starting in 2015 .We 're pretty sure most of you know how the election process works however if you do not , we encourage you to keep reading this section .We 're going to cover some basic material which will help you better understand our ( the U.S. ) electoral process .Electoral College vs. Popular Vote .The first thing you need to know is that the popular vote has no bearing on the outcome of the election meaning that it is totally possible for one candidate to get more votes than his / her competitor but still not win the election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.21899"}

{"text": "I 've noted many times that polls prior to primaries are of little predictive value .Polls in December 2007 showed that Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .While Clinton is certainly in a strong position this year , her leads in the national polls do not guarantee victory .Similarly , while Donald Trump seems to have a significant lead in the Republican race , it is premature to assume he will win unless he actually performs well in Iowa and New Hampshire .Alfred J. Tuchfarber has looked at the December polls and has also demonstrated how little predictive value they have .In polls from November 2007 , taken two months before voting , Hillary Clinton was leading the Democratic race .Rudy Guiliani was leading the Republican race , with Fred Thompson also ahead of John McCain .In 2011 Herman Cain was leading the Republican race , and had left the race by the time of the Iowa caucuses .One reason for the poor predictive value of national polls is that whoever wins in Iowa and/or New Hampshire generally gets a huge boost in subsequent states .That does n't mean that the polls in Iowa are all that more meaningful as voters there typically do n't make up their minds until the last minute .Hillary Clinton was leading in the polls in Iowa and came in third place in 2008 .In late 2007 Mitt Romney was leading the polls in Iowa , and came in second to Mike Huckabee .Herman Cain was leading in Iowa as well as the national polls two months before the Iowa caucus .Polls also have limited predictive value as the pollsters do not know who will actually turn out to vote .If the Democratic caucus in Iowa is dominated by long time Democratic voters , then the polls are showing the race as very close .If those who have n't previously voted but are showing enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders turn out to vote , there could be a big victory for Sanders .The much stronger degree of support seen for Sanders in social media is very encouraging , but no guarantee of votes .It might also be helpful for Sanders that the Iowa caucuses are later this year than in the 2008 cycle , when many college students were off on vacation .Even more might turn out for Sanders in this year than had turned out for Obama .Similarly we will not know whether Donald Trump will easily win the nomination , or if a party regular will challenge him , until we see how the voters act .The above electoral map prediction from Western Illinois University has received a lot of attention , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders , for showing Sanders winning in a landslide .Some argue that we should take this seriously because the mock election model has been right in every election it was used in since 1975 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.65487"}

Bernie Sanders at 27 % and Vice President Joe Biden at 20 % .Considering the historic volatility in polls prior to primary election , this remaining lead in the national polls could be erased quite quickly .If Sanders should win in Iowa and New Hampshire , where he currently leads , there is an excellent chance that he could increase his support nationally by well over ten percent .Clinton is showing a decrease in support among groups including women and liberals : .The shift away from the former secretary of state stems from shrinking support among women .Clinton 's advantage among women has disappeared in matchups against Bush and Carson .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.73657"}

Basically , the handicapped vote count will dictate the margin of electoral votes a candidate will need to win / lose by in order to win the wager .We mentioned Obama beat Romney by 126 electoral votes for which his handicapped line was 90.5 electoral votes .By winning by 91 or more votes , Obama won both the election as well as the wager for those who took the bet .It is unlikely to see this line until the weeks / days before the 2016 election .This predetermined amount will be different for each candidate based on his / her outlook for the upcoming election .Sometimes the over / under is handicapped through payouts to a single dollar wager because the difference in one state could potentially be as many as 55 electoral votes .Again , this wager usually is n't available until a week or two before the election .Odds To Win Popular Vote - This works just like the odds to win the election however winning the Electoral College and winning the popular vote are two completely different things mainly because you can win the popular vote but not the election .Still , odds for the popular vote are presented in the same format where either Candidate A or Candidate B wins .And without a spread / handicap , each side of the wager pays differently when a single dollar is wagered on one side versus the other .Look for the 2016 popular vote odds to become available within a month of the election date .Odds To Win A Particular Swing State - As we talked about previously , one state can make or break a campaign and therefore there is a lot of attention placed on particular states which could go either way ...Democrat or Republican .Each election is different but typically these wager revolve on bigger states which can actually impact the race significantly .Each state has different odds for Democrats or Republicans based on past elections , current polling , and registered voters in the state .Perhaps the best example of this wager was Florida in 2012 where Mitt Romney was better than a 2 to 1 favorite to win the state 's 29 electoral votes .Well , President Obama won Florida in 2012 thus winning a good chunk of money for anyone who bet on him to win the state because he was the underdog and a single dollar wager payed more than what was bet plus the original amount risked .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.53327"}
