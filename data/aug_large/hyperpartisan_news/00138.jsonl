{"text": "By Meghan Keneally .A revealing new map has made it clear where hundreds of hate groups are based in the United States , showing how racist and radical groups are still largely found in the South but the number of groups has multiplied dramatically since President Obama too office .The Southern Poverty Law Center has released a ' hate map ' last week which shows the national distribution of the various groups that they could confirm .The overall number of groups actually dropped from 1,007 in 2012 to 939 in 2013- the last full year with available data- but one of their more troubling observations is that some of the far - right leaning groups have had their ideologies picked up by conservative Republican politicians .Many states have varying bands of hate groups , but for their map , the SPLC qualified them into eight categories : black separatist , neo - confederate , Christian identity , racist skinhead , white nationalist , neo - Nazi , Ku Klux Klan and general hate .There is only one state- Hawaii- that has no known hate groups but a vast majority of the rest can be found below the Mason Dixon line .The 11 states that make up the area between Texas and the Atlantic are home to 589 of the 939 active groups that the SPLC identified- a whopping nearly 63 per cent .Though Florida hosts 58 groups and Texas has 57 , they do not take the top slot this year .You too ?It seems like the whole country is just filled with hate groups .Me , I 'm hating .My view on this ... .I get the impression that the neo - confederates are typically the more \" genteel \" racists .They try to gain political power through alliances with the GOP ( especially in the South , it seems like it 's good republican politics to be friendly to Daughters of the Confederacy and various other groups ) .But the way the party and its mouthpieces are going , it 's growing more tolerant of white - nationalists as well - which seems to be what the teabagger wing is largely made of .Neo - Nazis are tougher for the GOP to coalesce with , because that does n't exactly help the party in making inroads with conservative Jews .In most parts of the country , the KKK look like clowns - probably even among many racists .Those pointy hats and robes look silly and hurt them from being taken seriously .But with demographic changes , there are many that are probably sympathetic to some or many of their beliefs .I think most of the old Klan has been absorbed into many of these many Neo Confederate groups .After all , as Lee Atwater said the GOP ca n't run around yelling \" N - er , N - er , N - er \" .The Racist Skinheads and Neo - Nazis are definitely the most violent of the bunch so law enforcement is usually on them .The Skinheads main power base seems to be in prisons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.91808"}

Bush for ordering a warrantless domestic spying program .The resolution ( S.Res.398 ) was co - sponsored by Sens .Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) , Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) and John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , and did not receive a floor vote .In July , 2007 , Feingold again moved to censure President Bush , this time targeting Vice President Cheney and others as well .[ 1 ] Feingold 's second effort included two measures , one focusing on the war in Iraq , and the other on domestic issues like wiretapping .[ 2 ] .Feingold 's arguments on the Senate floor .In his remarks before the Senate on March 13 , 2006 , Feingold argued : . \"The President violated the law , ignored the Constitution and the other two branches of government , and disregarded the rights and freedoms upon which our country was founded .No one questions whether the government should wiretap suspected terrorists .Of course we should , and we can under current law .If there were a demonstrated need to change that law , Congress could consider that step .But instead the President is refusing to follow that law while offering the flimsiest of arguments to justify his misconduct .He must be held accountable for his actions . \"\" The President 's claims of inherent executive authority , and his assertions that the courts have approved this type of activity , are baseless ...But it is one thing to make a legal argument that has no real support in the law .It is much worse to do what the President has done , which is to make misleading statements about what prior Presidents have done and what courts have approved , to try to make the public believe his legal arguments are much stronger than they are . \"\" None of the President 's arguments explains or excuses his conduct , or the NSA 's domestic spying program .Not one .It is hard to believe that the President has the audacity to claim that they do . \"\" Passing a resolution to censure the President is a way to hold this President accountable .A resolution of censure is a time - honored means for the Congress to express the most serious disapproval possible , short of impeachment , of the Executive 's conduct .It is different than passing a law to make clear that certain conduct is impermissible or to cut off funding for certain activities .Both of those alternatives are ways for Congress to affect future action .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.49656"}

Lee 's tomb .That 's all I 'm saying .Well , Pat , I 'd have to say this is the first time anybody has ever implied that I 'm a racist boor .I did not imply that , but I do wonder why the fact that the university has Confederate associations should influence how black students there react to ways they see it impacting on the university today .If it 's significantly impacting the university today , then that 's a perfectly legitimate discussion for the university community to have .All I 'm saying is that there 's also a perfectly legitimate case to be made that the presence of Confederate flags inside Lee Chapel is neither inappropriate nor unexpected .I realize that many people are offended or uneasy by the sight of the flag , and their feelings are perfectly valid .But , as Kevin says , context is key when it comes to the Confederate flag , and in the context of a historic building containing the tomb of Robert E. Lee , I do n't think it 's out of place .No university should tolerate a general atmosphere on campus where students of any background feel unwelcome or intimidated .What I 'm saying is that I do n't think the presence of Confederate flags at Lee 's tomb would constitute such an atmosphere .It 's not that the school 's historic ties to Lee give the university a pass to display the Confederate flag whenever and wherever they want .My point is that the particular site of Lee Chapel is the sort of place where one could reasonably expect to see Confederate emblems displayed .The graves of Confederate soldiers and historic structures associated with Confederate memory are two settings where the flag 's presence is generally accepted by many people ; Lee Chapel is both .In such a case , I think dialogue over the flag 's connotations and associations is wonderful .A demand for removal with a deadline , on the other hand , does n't really take into account the circumstances of that particular setting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.96323"}

{"text": "It 's great reading and I 'll try to find the link .The other groups seek wider political power and seek weakening of civil rights laws and disenfranchisement of minority voters .In many ways they are more destructive on a macro level .At gun shows , the Ku Klux Klan are .the ones handing out paraphernalia depicting Obama as Hitler , while the skinheads / white nationalists are simply handing out Hitler paraphernalia .All while voting for the same candidates and holding roughly the same political views ... .I would guess that the neo - confederates would be .more closely associated with the Klan and the neo - nazis would identify more closely with skinheads , but that 's only a guess .I do n't know the difference either .That 's why I was asking .I 'm just wondering which part of \" Oh I hate _ _ _ _ \" differentiates between all of them .They are all pretty hateful .Does one eat quiche and another scorn those that do ?Does having a vintage hunting rifle make you one or the other , or is just photoshop skills and the ability to make pamphlets mean you are one or the other ?Is the ability to pee straight a qualification ?I 'm just trying to figure out what the difference between them is , like a biologist .Genus Hatred , species KKK Genus Hatred , species neo - nazi .Mostly time .Neo - confederates and neo - nazis both are tied to failed political movements .I live in Texas and you can see plenty of confederate \" cya \" material at the state capitol , including a plaque which explains that the Civil War had absolutely nothing to do with slavery , and was an ardent defense of state rights .Neo - nazis are usually simultaneously Holocaust deniers and violent anti - Semites .KKK are somewhat similar to neo - confederates in that their roots are in the post civil war south and originally tried to restore all the racial privileges of whites in the south .They changed over the years , but to me they are n't too different from their roots , the first and most violent neo - confederates .White nationalists want to eventually have their own racially pure country , like the plot of the Turner Diaries ( it used to be online , it 's some of the worst writing I 've ever read ) .Racist Skinheads I think were co - opted out of skinhead / ska fad , umm maybe 1970 's -1980 's first in the UK then here I think .In the UK I believe it was to diffuse / confuse unemployed people to blame minorities for their economic problems rather than Thatcherism and austerity .Operationally , they are n't too different .A documentary called \" Blood in the Face \" was my first media exposure to them .It provides an overview and interviews with a few of these people .One of the directors was involved in \" The Atomic Cafe \" ( a simultaneously satiric and chilling narrator - less documentary that used of mostly pro atomic warfare government films , period films and news ) , and some of the interviews are conducted by an off camera Michael Moore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.63964"}

{"text": "I find your posts often very thoughtful and insightful , but this one just smacks of victim mentality .Maybe I 'm being obtuse , but if a \" black kid \" who visits the burial site is bothered , then perhaps that is EXACTLY what should be happening .Life is n't about sanitizing everything to make everybody feel good .R. E. Lee fought for the Confederacy and led troops under that flag , and to strip it away and make everybody ever so comfortable diminishes the entire historical narrative , in my opinion .Gosh , I hate to make this comparison , but the Holocaust Museum has Nazi memorabilia on display .So should that all be removed as well ?I hate to make this comparison , but the Holocaust Museum has Nazi memorabilia on display .So should that all be removed as well ?Eric , context is all .As Pat has explained , the Lee Chapel , Confederate flags and all , is a shrine to Lost Cause nostalgia .As such , it is a contemporary celebration of an ideology that many of us , black or otherwise , find repugnant .It is not a museum .The Holocaust Museum is a museum , not a shrine to Nazi ideology - and that is a distinction that makes all the difference .If the Nazi flag were flying over the graves of World War 2 German War dead , there would rightly be an outcry ( and no , I 'm not comparing the Confederacy to Nazi Germany , just responding to your question ) .As for those who say that Lee merely \" served his state \" , I would just observe that what he served was the white secessionist government of his state - he was actively fighting against the wishes and interests of white Unionist and black Virginians .And after the war , as others have observed , he actively supported white supremacy in Virginia . \"As Pat has explained , the Lee Chapel , Confederate flags and all , is a shrine to Lost Cause nostalgia .\" I simply disagree with this assessment .It may well have been that , as Stuart pointed out , but I do n't see that being the case any longer .That being said , it strikes me that the Committee is more interested in battering the past than dealing with the present .But in the ever so important context of the museum at W&L , Lee served a five year , very productive tenure as President of a college .In those five years , he was not a slave owner , or a Confederate General ; he was a reformer that modernized and saved that college .The museum and the university includes the narrative of slavery unapologetically .The chapel was not created as a \" pilgrimage \" site , it has become one .Lee requested the chapel because it suited his idea for the college .It was finished in 1868 , it housed his office , the treasurer 's office and the student center during that time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.87929"}
