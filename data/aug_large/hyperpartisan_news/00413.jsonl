' \" On Friday , the Times finally decided to inform its readers of the change to its Thursday story .An earlier version of this article and an earlier headline , using information from senior government officials , misstated the nature of the referral to the Justice Department regarding Hillary Clinton 's personal email account while she was secretary of state .The referral addressed the potential compromise of classified information in connection with that personal email account .It did not specifically request an investigation into Mrs. Clinton .Mediaite chronicled the critical responses of some in the media - from both Left and Right - to the Times ' \" stealth edit .\" Perhaps the hardest hitting rebuke came from Ricochet 's Stephen Miller : .As reported by Western Journalism , one of Clinton 's claims from her U.N. press conference about her emails has been shown to be false .The State Department confirmed last month that she did not turn over all her work - related emails .Select Committee on Benghazi chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy , R - S.C. , said in a statement regarding the revelation : \" This has implications far beyond Libya , Benghazi and our committee 's work .This conclusively shows her email arrangement with herself , which was then vetted by her own lawyers , has resulted in an incomplete public record . \"According to the Times , the Justice Department has not decided whether to open a criminal investigation into the transmission of classified material through Clinton 's private email accounts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "38.01546"}
{"text": "Tag : Clinton .The State Department has decided to withhold seven more e - mails from Hillary Clinton 's unauthorized and nonsecure homebrew system as too sensitive to release even in redacted form .That brings the total number of such messages to 29 , and one member of Congress who has seen them is aghast at what may have been exposed : .\" There are more than 22 , and it 's not just one or two more , \" Rep. Chris Stewart told the Washington Examiner , referring to the 22 emails deemed top secret by the State Department last week .\" It 's a more meaningful number than that . \"Stewart said the State Department has classified seven additional emails as \" top secret . \" The agency will now withhold 29 emails from the public due to their sensitive content .\" These were classified at the top secret level , and in some cases , above that , \" he said . . .Yesterday , Stewart told Fox News what kind of information went through the server - and it 's every bit as bad as one would imagine : .\" My heavens , \" he tells Martha McCallum , \" if I received an e - mail saying , ' here are the names and addresses and phone numbers of ten of our undercover agents in Pakistan , ' I would know ... that was classified .I would n't look for a heading .\"Stewart then says that his hypothetical is n't what was found in the e - mails , but clearly Stewart believes it to be as obvious as the hypothetical suggests .And if these messages disclosed human assets , as Stewart explicitly accuses in this interview after having seen the e - mails , then it would be obvious that they could not be transmitted through or retained within an unauthorized and non - secure system .It 's no surprise , then , that the House Oversight Committee will start an investigation into exactly what went wrong and how much damage has been done to American intelligence by the State Department - and perhaps to put some pressure on the Department of Justice : .House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz says he 's forging ahead with an investigation into the federal government 's record keeping - a probe he acknowledges could put Hillary Clinton in the cross hairs .But Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy have been clear : They believe the FBI and Justice Department should handle the investigation into Clinton 's use of personal email for government business , and that congressional involvement could disrupt the criminal probe and appear overly partisan .Taking that cue , the House Science Committee , which had planned its own investigation into Clinton 's email server , on Wednesday opted to delay its inquiry and defer to the FBI , an aide on the panel told POLITICO .As for Chaffetz , Ryan ( R - Wis . ) is giving him the green light to proceed - with caution .It will also send a signal to the DoJ that simply running out the clock will not suffice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "38.699722"}
