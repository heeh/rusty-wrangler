Henson - a.k.a .the real - life alter ego of Empire 's Cookie - will be hosting Saturday Night Live on April 11 with musical guest Mumford & Sons .( The show also announced that Michael Keaton will host on April 4 , with musical guest Carly Rae Jepsen . )If you 've been reading the site lately , you know how obsessed we are with all things Empire , Cookie , and Henson .( Or did you miss us freaking out over the finale , begging Henson to tell us her secrets and waxing fangirl about how Empire has changed television ?I know , it 's almost starting to get weird . )So this is pretty big .And seeing as the news hit just as my daily caffeine did , my mind has gone into overdrive imagining what Henson might do on the show .So , without further ado , Megan Angelo Presents : Cookie Lyon Presents : The Lucious Lyon Sound Live From New York , it 's Taraji P. Henson .She should sing .I 'm sure that , eventually , there 'll be a plot point on season two of Empire that involves the debut of Cookie 's voice .Thing is , Empire wo n't be back for months , read more .Dakota Johnson hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time this weekend , and with her debut came everything we love about the show : a few celeb cameos ( the perks of having famous parents ! ) , a dash of controversy , a steady amount of laughs , and a whole lotta awkwardness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.1908"}
