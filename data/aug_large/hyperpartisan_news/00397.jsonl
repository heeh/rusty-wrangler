Edgar Hoover reforms , the FBI has been designed to be free from political pressure and interference .Although no director has yet stayed for a full ten - year term , that term is meant to outlast whichever President appointed him ( and they have all been men thus far ) .During Richard Nixon 's presidency , senior FBI official W. Mark Felt , appalled at what he found taking place in the administration , became the Watergate source known as Deep Throat .In the Clinton era , director Louis Freeh had such a sour relationship with the President that the two barely spoke ; Freeh turned in his White House pass because he did n't visit frequently enough .For Mueller , it all comes down to that oath - the one that all of his agents swore at Quantico when they graduated from the academy .Now , every six weeks or so , Mueller makes the short trip to the FBI Academy to administer that same oath of office to a new crop of FBI agents .Roughly 40 percent of the bureau 's agents are new since 9/11 .It 's said that there 's no such thing as a former Marine , and people around Mueller say he fits the stereotype .Fastidious and serious , he sets high standards and demands excellence .His experiences as a Marine , including Army Ranger jump school and some tough months in combat , forged his personality and style in ways that are reflected daily at the bureau .\" I would n't be here without the Marine Corps , \" he says .\" You see a lot [ in combat ] , and every day after it is a blessing . \"After being in war , he says , \" a lot 's going to come your way , but it 's not going to be the same intensity . \"He credits his Marine training with teaching him leadership - although he got a C in delegation in Officer Candidate School .He jokes today that he did n't understand the concept .\" You do n't eat before your troops eat , \" he says , \" and you do n't ask your troops to do anything you wo n't do , too . \"He works his staff hard - chiefs of staff and special assistants rarely last longer than a year with him .His former chief of staff Dan Levin said that when he left , he had worked 365 days straight .Upon departure , they believe in Mueller and his work - he 's a great boss , they say .But they add that they 've never seen anyone work as hard for as long .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.45459"}

Edgar Hoover 's years still resonate with many civil liberty advocates - and in choosing Comey President Obama has given a strong indication of his expectation of the Bureau 's respect for constitutional standards .Speaking earlier this month at Comey 's alma mater 's 2013 Commencement , Mueller told the graduates of William & Mary , \" I did not really choose public service .Rather , I more or less fell into it early on , perhaps not fully appreciating the challenges of such service .The way in which you choose to serve does not matter - only that you work to better your country and your community , \" Mueller said , bedecked in the green and black gown of the school that taught Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe .But Mueller cautioned the graduatating students that one attribute mattered more than any other in a life of service : \" Regardless of your chosen career , you are only as good as your word .You can be smart , aggressive , articulate , and indeed persuasive .But if you are not honest , your reputation will suffer .And once lost , a good reputation can never , ever be regained .The Hunt Is On For A New FBI Director .The Hunt Is On For A New FBI Director .Robert Mueller became FBI director just days before the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .Since then , he 's been the U.S. government 's indispensable man when it comes to national security .But Mueller 's term has expired , and the clock is ticking on an unprecedented extension that Congress gave him two years ago .The first time the Obama White House thought about a replacement for Mueller , back in 2011 , officials threw up their hands and wound up begging him to stay .Congress passed a special law to allow it .Then Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa put his foot down .\" Extending a director 's term was not a fly - by - night decision , \" Grassley said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing .\" It also puts the president on notice to begin the process of selecting and nominating a new FBI director earlier than the last attempt . \" Behind the scenes , that process is well under way .The FBI director serves a 10-year term - designed to give that person insulation from partisan politics .But whomever President Obama chooses could become a big part of his legacy .The administration approached D.C. federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland , who said he did n't want the job , according to two sources familiar with the exchange .Other possible candidates , such as former Chicago U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald , recently started lucrative jobs in the private sector after spending decades in public service .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.01009"}
