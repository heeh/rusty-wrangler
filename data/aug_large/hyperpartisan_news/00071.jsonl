Wilson IV , was a C.I.A. employee .Mr. Wilson was a critic of the administration 's Iraq policies .The official said that the option of recusal or referral to a special prosecutor remained ' ' wide open . ' 'The official said that the question of whether Mr. Ashcroft should step aside had been discussed among Mr. Ashcroft 's senior advisers , but that so far none of the career lawyers on the case had recommended that the attorney general remove himself .The official said Mr. Ashcroft had twice gathered his investigative team to urge them to find out who had leaked the identity of the C.I.A. operative and to prosecute that person if possible . ''He 's angry about this , ' ' the official said .But Mr. Ashcroft faces the same political and legal dilemma that haunted his predecessors when the Justice Department has been forced to examine the conduct of senior officials in the White House or the Cabinet .Janet Reno was forced to turn to independent counsels seven times in her nearly eight - year tenure at the department .But her refusal to seek an outside prosecutor to investigate charges of campaign finance irregularities in President Bill Clinton 's re - election campaign in 1996 permanently damaged Ms. Reno 's standing in the capital .Mr. Ashcroft 's relationship with the White House is far closer than Ms. Reno 's was with President Clinton .Mr. Ashcroft has closed ranks with President Bush in the war against terrorism , which has altered nearly three decades in which most attorneys general and F.B.I. directors sought to keep a distance from the White House .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.942406"}

Hogan on July 6 , where she remains .The initial criminal investigation began well before the case was turned over to Fitzgerald in December 2003 .It started shortly after conservative columnist Robert Novak first identified Plame as an undercover CIA officer , in a July 14 , 2003 , column .Wilson had only recently led a CIA - sponsored mission to the African nation of Niger to investigate claims that Saddam Hussein was covertly attempting to buy enriched uranium from the African nation to build a nuclear weapon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.858406"}

Bush administration seeking to continue a warrantless wiretapping program , putting his job on the line to do so .When a reporter asked him if he did n't have a duty to support President Bush , Comey answered \" No , my responsibility , I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States .\" Obama proudly cited that independent streak when he announced Comey 's appointment .If the FBI discovers evidence of wrong - doing - and there are many reasons to think they will - Comey will not sit on the findings .The FBI does not indict ; that is up to the Justice Department .But , if the FBI makes a recommendation to indict , and Justice ignores the report , rumor is the FBI could make public the incriminating material .Either way , Hillary Clinton 's political ambitions are toast .Related : Why Every Candidate in the 2016 Race Should Fear Mike Bloomberg .The inquiry began by looking into whether Clinton 's use of a personal email server violated security standards ; it has since been expanded twice .As reported by Judge Andrew Napolitano of Fox News , Clinton signed an oath promising to comply with the laws protecting national security information , violations that the Obama administration has aggressively prosecuted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.84484"}
{"text": "Bush personally intervened to sideline the Justice Department probe in April 2006 by taking the unusual step of denying investigators the security clearances necessary for their work .It is unclear whether the president knew at the time of his decision that the Justice inquiry - to be conducted by the department 's internal ethics watchdog , the Office of Professional Responsibility - would almost certainly examine the conduct of his attorney general .At the time the story was published , Gonzales was fighting for his political life .Republicans in Congress had joined Democrats in sharply criticizing Gonzales for his role in the firings of nine U.S. attorneys .A whole new controversy might make his resignation from office imminent .Gonzales immediately fought back .At the time , it appeared that the president had halted the Justice Department 's probe in order to protect his attorney general , whose conduct was going to be a central focus for investigators .But as more information continues to come to light , the president 's denial of the security clearances raises an important question : Were the president 's actions designed to protect his attorney general - or himself ?Most Popular .The number of American teens who excel at advanced math has surged .Why ?O n a sultry evening last July , a tall , soft - spoken 17-year - old named David Stoner and nearly 600 other math whizzes from all over the world sat huddled in small groups around wicker bistro tables , talking in low voices and obsessively refreshing the browsers on their laptops .The air in the cavernous lobby of the Lotus Hotel Pang Suan Kaew in Chiang Mai , Thailand , was humid , recalls Stoner , whose light South Carolina accent warms his carefully chosen words .The tension in the room made it seem especially heavy , like the atmosphere at a high - stakes poker tournament .Stoner and five teammates were representing the United States in the 56th International Mathematical Olympiad .They figured they 'd done pretty well over the two days of competition .God knows , they 'd trained hard .Stoner , like his teammates , had endured a grueling regime for more than a year - practicing tricky problems over breakfast before school and taking on more problems late into the evening after he completed the homework for his college - level math classes .Sometimes , he sketched out proofs on the large dry - erase board his dad had installed in his bedroom .Most nights , he put himself to sleep reading books like New Problems in Euclidean Geometry and An Introduction to Diophantine Equations .The tight grip of oligarchy upon the American political system slipped a little last night in New Hampshire .On the Democratic side , voters cast their ballots for one of the most implausible candidates in modern presidential history - less because his rhetoric was so mesmerizing or his program so inspiring than as a protest against an expected winner perceived as a lavishly compensated servitor of organized wealth .In her concession speech , Hillary Clinton boasted of her small donors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.15737"}

Moschella .Moschella and Deputy Attorney General Paul J. McNulty have told congressional investigators that Rove attended the meeting along with White House Counsel Fred F. Fielding , Deputy Counsel William Kelley and other White House aides , congressional aides said .McNulty and Moschella said that the meeting focused on how Moschella should describe the reasons for firing the eight prosecutors , and that none of the White House officials disclosed the extent of White House involvement in the dismissals at the session .White House spokeswoman Dana M. Perino said yesterday that \" it is not at all unusual , nor is it inappropriate , for people at the White House to meet with members of the administration before they are going up to testify in front of Congress .\" Rove 's involvement in the meeting was first described on Newsweek magazine 's Web site .The new McKay information , which became public this week , shows that he was recommended for dismissal in March 2005 , just four months after a disputed gubernatorial election in Washington state .Republicans there complained about McKay 's decision not to file charges of voter fraud because of a lack of evidence .The information appears to undercut testimony from Gonzales , who told the Senate Judiciary Committee last month that McKay was removed because of more recent disputes over an information - sharing system and budgetary issues .Justice spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said an \" inadvertent mistake , \" led to the release of a document that did not show McKay being recommended for removal in early 2005 .A corrected copy was later sent to Congress but apparently not released to the public .Roehrkasse declined to comment on Gonzales 's testimony about McKay .Officials have said that Gonzales relied on Justice documents in reviewing the reasons behind the firings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.44752"}

Pete Domenici ( R - NM ) had contacted senior department officials to \" express general concerns \" about New Mexico U.S. Attorney David Iglesias .Domenici 's office has previously said he raised concerns about Iglesias ' handling of immigration issues , among other things .Still no comment from Domenici or Heather Wilson ( R - NM ) on whether each of them placed calls to Iglesias before the mid - term elections inquiring about the status of a public corruption investigation of a state Democrat , as Iglesias claims .I notice that Gates is getting good press for being decisive and acting quickly .I concede that he has not been on the job long .But have n't the conditions at Walter Reed been bad for a very long time ?Relatives of military people and military personnel would typically first complain to those in authority and in the service .What happened to those complaints ?Have n't dozens of senior officers and doctors known ?Have n't at least mid - level White House people known ?Would n't it be interesting to learn what , if anything , Rumsfeld knew ?Do n't the quick firings and positive publicity for Gates seem like intentional distraction for a more serious , long - standing problem ?In March 2004 , White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales made a now - famous late - night visit to the hospital room of Attorney General John Ashcroft , seeking to get Ashcroft to sign a certification stating that the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretapping program was legal .According to people familiar with statements recently made by Gonzales to federal investigators , Gonzales is now saying that George Bush personally directed him to make that hospital visit .Related story : .The Case of the Gonzales Notes Did Alberto Gonzales create a set of fictitious notes to justify the reauthorization of Bush 's warrantless eavesdropping program ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.77604"}
{"text": "The hospital visit is already central to many contemporaneous historical accounts of the Bush presidency .At the time of the visit , Ashcroft had been in intensive care for six days , was heavily medicated , and was recovering from emergency surgery to remove his gall bladder .The White House declined to comment for this story .An attorney for Gonzales , George J. Terwilliger III , himself a former deputy attorney general , declined to comment as well .Although this president is famously known for rarely becoming immersed in the details - even on the issues he cares the most about - Gonzales has painted a picture of Bush as being very much involved when it came to his administration 's surveillance program .In describing Bush as having pressed him to engage in some of the more controversial actions regarding the warrantless surveillance program , Gonzales and his legal team are apparently attempting to lessen his own legal jeopardy .The Justice Department 's inspector general ( IG ) is investigating whether Gonzales lied to Congress when he was questioned under oath about the surveillance program .And the Justice Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) is separately investigating whether Gonzales and other Justice Department attorneys acted within the law in authorizing and overseeing the surveillance program .Neither the IG nor OPR can bring criminal charges , but if , during the course of their own investigations , they believe they have uncovered evidence of a possible crime , they can seek to make a criminal referral to those who can .In portraying President Bush as directly involved in making some of the more controversial decisions about his administration 's surveillance program , Gonzales may , intentionally or unintentionally , be drawing greater legal scrutiny to the actions of President Bush and other White House officials .And what began as investigations narrowly focused on Gonzales 's conduct could easily morph into broader investigations leading into the White House , and possibly leading to the appointment of a special prosecutor .At the same time , by saying that he is advising the president , Gonzales also makes it easier for those at the White House to claim executive privilege if they do indeed become embroiled in the probe .Moreover , according to one senior Justice Department official , Gonzales , his legal team , and the White House also know that Justice 's IG and OPR are unlikely to press senior White House officials , let alone the president , to answer their questions .But this legal strategy could also backfire .One scenario feared by the White House is that the IG or OPR could send a public report to Congress concluding that Gonzales or some other official may have committed a crime .At a minimum , that would make the conduct of Gonzales , or of any other official deemed to be under suspicion , the subject of a criminal investigation .If the report also raised unanswered questions about possible misconduct by other senior administration officials , or even the president , that could lead to the appointment of a special prosecutor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.1265"}

Fitzgerald .Up until that point , the investigation had been conducted by a team of career prosecutors and FBI agents , some of whom believed Ashcroft should recuse himself .Democrats on Capitol Hill were calling for him to step down , but he did not .Then on December 30 , 2003 , Ashcroft unexpectedly recused himself from further overseeing the matter , and James B. Comey , then deputy attorney general , named Patrick J. Fitzgerald as the special prosecutor who would take over the case .During his initial interview with the FBI , in the fall of 2003 , Rove did not disclose that he had ever discussed Plame with Time magazine correspondent Matthew Cooper , according to two legal sources with firsthand knowledge of the matter .Federal investigators were also skeptical of claims by Rove that he had only first learned of Plame 's employment with the CIA from a journalist , even though he also claimed he could not specifically recall the name of the journalist .As the truthfulness of Rove 's accounts became more of a focus of investigators , career Justice Department employees and senior FBI officials became even more concerned about the continuing role in the investigation of Ashcroft , because of his close relationship with Rove .Rove had earlier served as an adviser to Ashcroft during the course of three political campaigns .The former attorney general had well documented conflicts of interest in this matter , particularly with regard to his personal relationship with Karl Rove .Among other things , Rove was employed by Ashcroft throughout his political career , and Rove reportedly had fiercely advocated for Ashcroft 's appointment as attorney general .Pursuant to standard rules of legal ethics , and explicit rules on conflict of interest , those facts alone should have dictated his immediate recusal .A Justice Department spokesman declined on Friday to say what action , if any , might be taken in response to Conyers ' request .Also of concern to investigators when they sought Ashcroft 's recusal , according to law enforcement sources , was that a number among Ashcroft 's inner circle had partisan backgrounds that included working closely with Rove .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.40468"}

Hogan on July 6 , where she remains .The initial criminal investigation began well before the case was turned over to Fitzgerald in December 2003 .It started shortly after conservative columnist Robert Novak first identified Plame as an undercover CIA officer , in a July 14 , 2003 , column .Wilson had only recently led a CIA - sponsored mission to the African nation of Niger to investigate claims that Saddam Hussein was covertly attempting to buy enriched uranium from the African nation to build a nuclear weapon .Wilson reported back to the CIA that the allegations were most likely the result of a hoax .When Wilson sought out White House officials , believing they did not know all the facts , he was rebuffed .He then went public with his criticism of the Bush administration .It was then that senior administration officials began their campaign to discredit Wilson as a means of countering his criticisms of them .Rove and Libby , and to a lesser extent then deputy National Security Council ( NSC ) adviser Stephen J. Hadley ( who is currently Bush 's NSC adviser ) , directed these efforts .Both Rove and Libby discussed with Novak , Cooper , and other journalists the fact that Wilson 's wife worked for the CIA , and that she was responsible for sending him to Niger , in an effort to discredit him .The manner by which Rove and Libby learned of Plame 's employment at the CIA before they shared that information with journalists is central to whether any federal criminal laws regarding classified information were violated .Rove and Libby have reportedly claimed they learned of the information from journalists .Rove in particular told FBI officials that he first learned of Plame 's employment with the CIA from a journalist , but drew their suspicions when he claimed that he could not recall the journalist 's name .Dated June 10 , 2003 , the memo was written for Marc Grossman , then the undersecretary of state for political affairs .It mentioned Plame , her employment with the CIA , and her possible role in recommending her husband for the Niger mission because he had previously served in the region .The mention of Plame 's CIA employment was classified \" Secret \" and was contained in the second paragraph of the three - page classified paper .On July 6 , 2003 , Wilson published his now famous New York Times op - ed and appeared on \" Meet the Press . \" The following day , on July 7 , the memo was sent to then secretary of state Colin L.
