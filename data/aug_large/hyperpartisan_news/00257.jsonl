{"text": "But how many women and children had to be raped , and killed , in just these three cases , before anybody in the courts could be bothered to respond appropriately , all the times these men could have been put away ?Victim Advocacy .Archives .OKLAHOMA CITY ( AP ) - A teenager 's mother clapped her hands and screamed with joy , and a former police officer hung his head and sobbed , as a jury convicted him of raping her daughter and sexually assaulting seven other women .The mother of Daniel Holtzclaw 's youngest accuser said she hopes his guilty verdict will show everyone that sexual misconduct by police officers has to be taken seriously .\" It 's a problem for the nation , \" she told The Associated Press .Holtzclaw was convicted Thursday night of preying on the teenager and other women he met while working his beat in a minority , low - income neighborhood .He could spend the rest of his life in prison ; the jury recommended 263 years , including 30-year sentences for each of four first - degree rape convictions .The jury found Holtzclaw guilty of 18 counts connected to eight of the 13 women , and acquitted him of 18 others .Sexual misconduct committed by law enforcement officers is a problem that has concerned police chiefs for years .Holtzclaw 's case was among those examined in a yearlong Associated Press investigation that revealed about 1,000 officers nationwide had lost their licenses for sex crimes or other sexual misconduct over a six - year period .The AP 's finding is undoubtedly an undercount , since not every state has a process for banning problem officers from re - entering law enforcement , and states that do vary greatly in how they report and prosecute wrongdoers .One factor stands out , however - victims tend to be among society 's most vulnerable : juveniles , drug addicts , and women in custody or with a criminal history .That 's exactly who authorities accused Holtzclaw of targeting .After Oklahoma City Police received a complaint from a grandmother who said Holtzclaw forced her to perform oral sex during a traffic stop , investigators identified a dozen other women who said he had victimized them as well .The youngest , a 17-year - old girl , was the last to testify at his trial .The girl recalled Holtzclaw pulling up in his police car as she walked home one night in June 2014 .Holtzclaw drove her to her family 's home and walked her to the porch , where he told her he had to search her .She said he grabbed her breasts , then pulled down her pink shorts and raped her .He asked if it was the first time she had ever had sex with a cop , she testified .Her DNA was found on his uniform trousers .Holtzclaw 's attorney , Scott Adams , asked the girl about perceived inconsistencies in her testimony as well as her use of drugs .She pushed back , telling the lawyer : \" I 'm really getting upset by the way you 're coming after me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "38.370647"}

Ellis , who killed at least nine women , and managed to avoid detection because Wisconsin officials failed to bother to hold him responsible for submitting another inmate 's DNA as his own before releasing him from prison .I had just spent several months and many hundreds of dollars to get copies of the police investigation reports for my rape and some of the court records of the man who was accused of , but never prosecuted for the crime .Every time he was sent away on another sex crime conviction , the police closed all the other rape cases they attributed to him .In 1987 he was tried for one sexual assault , and at least six other cases were shelved , including mine .Such was the economy of justice in 1987 : rapes were not deemed important enough to expend the court resources to try every known defendant for every crime .This attitude arose not from the police but from the legal establishment and , by extension , the public .It was an accepted status quo , not just in Sarasota , but everywhere .To behave as if each rape victim actually deserved justice and every woman deserved to be safe from offenders was not anybody 's priority for spending money in 1987 .The same can still be said today , though attitudes have spottily improved .We 've never spent enough money to thoroughly investigate and prosecute more than a fraction of all crimes .Criminals know this , though the public remains largely oblivious .I remember being astonished when the police told me the D.A. would not be prosecuting my case , even though there was evidence and a rape kit .A few months later , the first rape case in the United States using DNA evidence would be won in Orlando , a mere hundred miles and three jurisdictions away .There , the D.A. had decided to be aggressive and use this new technology already in use in Britain , and he succeeded .But more than a decade would pass before DNA evidence was even routinely collected and databased in most states .A lot of people slipped through the cracks unnecessarily during that decade , including my rapist .Sentenced to 15 years for his 1997 crime , he walked out of prison seven years later , the beneficiary of both the state 's unwillingness to fully fund prisons and activists ' efforts to get every convict back onto the streets as quickly as possible .He immediately returned to raping elderly women , his preferred victims , and was n't back in prison until 1998 .At least the prisoner activists , and the defense bar , were happy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.8825"}

{"text": "Emotional issues often play a role in false accusations , whether it is intentional or not .The fear of someone finding out about the sexual relationship or the guilt associated with having a sexual relationship with someone , can result in a person being falsely accused .Mistaken identity is also common in these types of cases .False Accusation : Unfortunately , there are situations where a person is falsely accused of rape .An example might be that , after having consensual sex , one of the parties has feelings of guilt because they were involved in a committed relationship .But , rather than admitting to the infidelity , accuses the other party of rape .Also , a false accusation could result after being pressured and coerced by another to say they were raped .The Accused Believed There Was Consent : If the accused did not have a clear understanding that the accuser did not want to have sexual intercourse , this may be a defense .Although , any indication from a party , at any time , that they want to stop , would constitute no consent .There was no actual intercourse .Lack of Sufficient Evidence : If there is no physical evidence and no witnesses , then it becomes one person 's word against the other and therefore , too difficult to prosecute .Mistaken Identity : Because rape victims are traumatized and emotional , it is not uncommon to unintentionally identify the wrong person .If there was poor lighting during the attack , identification is more difficult .If the attacker is wearing a mask , identification becomes extremely difficult .Also , police lineups are often prejudicial and result in mistaken identity .What Does A Prosecutor Have To Prove For A Rape Conviction .To be convicted of rape , it must be proven that : 1 )The parties engaged in sexual intercourse ; 2 )That the sexual intercourse was accomplished by physical force , violence duress , menace , fear of bodily harm , fear of retaliation or fraud .There must also be a lack of consent .What Is Lack Of Consent - The obvious is that the victim did not give consent .The consequences of a rape conviction can be severe and can permanently damage a person 's life .Because of the issues dealing with the emotional and physical evidence of such a crime , often innocent people are accused of this very serious crime .For this reason , it is strongly advised that anyone who has been accused of rape , whether or not an arrest has occurred , should consult with an experienced criminal defense attorney .Often , an attorney who has a good working relationship with the District Attorney 's Office , can speak with the District Attorney reviewing the case for filing , and present information that may result in the case being rejected .A Santa Ana City Councilman , who was also once an Orange County , executive , has been charged with sexual battery , along with several other felony counts dealing with sexual misconduct .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.58435"}

{"text": "He remained in the county jail Saturday afternoon .Here 's what they did not report : Daryle Edward Jones was supposed to be in prison until April .Or at least that is how long he would have served , had he served his entire previous sentence .Which , of course , nobody ever does , but is n't it nice to imagine that somebody , somewhere , even once , would serve all their damn time ?In April of 1994 , Jones committed voluntary manslaughter .It 's hard to know from the online records what he really did , but suffice to say that getting 20 years in 1994 was the maximum for that crime and serving nearly all of it was unusual , so I suspect at least one of two things : .The crime was particularly heinous and the voluntary manslaughter was offered only with an agreement to serve a long sentence .Jones , who was 21 at the time , must have had a terrible juvenile record , likely sealed .So Darlye Jones went to prison for voluntary manslaughter in April , 1995 ( he 'd probably had a year in jail before that ) and got out June , 2010 , fifteen years later .Then he was back in prison from January , 2012 to October , 2013 , possibly for a parole violation because no other crime is listed .Four months after finally being released , he has committed a heinous kidnapping / rape .What is there to learn from this ?Under - prosecution may be the problem .My guess - and it 's just a guess - is that Jones had a prolific and violent criminal career before being put away at the age of 21 .Yet he was only charged with one crime , which is entirely typical , even today .Contrary to what all liberals and all those Right on Crime Grover Norquist types and Reason libertarians believe , our criminal justice system is wildly lenient towards nearly all criminals and expends the resources to put away only a tiny fraction of people who commit even serious crimes .And given his current crime and the severity of his previous sentence , he may have been a sex offender but the sex offense was not kept on the table for some reason .He 's not in the sex offender registry , as far as I can tell .There is troubling talk across the Right today about prosecutorial over - reach .I consider such talk to be almost entirely anecdotal and wildly out of touch with reality in our criminal courts - and motivated in large part by Alex Jones and his ilk , who have it out for police in an utterly personal and unhinged way .Yes , the Department of Justice in Washington and Eric Holder in particular are troubling , and Holder is openly contemptuous of the rule of law and treats victims of crime with contempt - except those who fit certain categories of so - called hate crime that he invented in 1999 .Holder is pro - criminal , anti - victim and almost entirely lawless , but Eric Holder does not represent law enforcement in the states .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.054405"}
