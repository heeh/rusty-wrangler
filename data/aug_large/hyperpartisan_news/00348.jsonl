{"text": "I now see that I will be able to make a real work of art of this big group .Back in my heart that has been a doubt for many years .I really have no help in that ; in that I am absolutely alone .It was an image he cultivated , this lonely fighter 's posture , but there were people whose contributions even Gutzon could not deny .Borglum may have devised the plan to give a twinkle to the presidential eyes , but it was the workmen who sculpted the two - foot long shafts of granite in the middle of each pupil , so that sunlight bouncing off the exposed point gave life to the eyes .Rex Alan Smith , Author : There were things about him that bothered them very much , but down underneath they developed a loyalty , it 's amazing , they developed a basic loyalty to Gutzon Borglum .With all his flamboyance , unpredictability , irascibility , there was some kind of a flame in the man , a charisma , a something that inspired a deeper loyalty .Narrator : By 1940 , Gutzon Borglum had made himself someone extraordinary .He was the man who carved mountains .And he stood America 's highest peak . . .he had achieved celebrity -- even pitching ads for Studebaker and Bromo - Seltzer .Still , Gutzon saw so much to be done on his mountain .He meant to extend the sculptures down to the waist ; was at work on a Hall of Records , a cavernous time capsule for storing the important documents of the American democracy .But more than anything , he was still trying to transform his mountain into a work of art , fighting the one thing he could n't beat : time itself .At the beginning of 1941 , the coming World War overwhelmed Mount Rushmore .After a dozen years , Congress finally cut off funding for good .A week later , Gutzon Borglum was dead -- suddenly and unexpectedly , at age 73 -- from complications following surgery .Dr. Karl Wegner , Peter Norbeck 's Grandson : Lincoln Borglum , of course , had taken over after his father died .By then a major part of the work had been completed , but there was still a fair amount of trimming and cleaning up to do around the faces and , and the collars of and shoulders of some of the figures .And the great hall of records which had been another great ambition and dream of Borglum 's pretty much perished in the process .The work at Rushmore just sort of gradually drew to a close .Narrator : It took 14 years to carve Mount Rushmore .Men removed half a million tons of granite , driving 120 feet deep in places .George Washington 's face is 60 feet long , his nose 20 , and each eye is 11 feet wide .Roosevelt 's moustache is 20 feet across .Lincoln 's mole , 16 inches .The carving cost $ 989,992.32 -- almost all of it from the United States treasury .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "137.30995"}
