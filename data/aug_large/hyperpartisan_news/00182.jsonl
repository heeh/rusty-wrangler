{"text": "To try to understand what the SPLC report actually means , we took a look at their other literature so as to understand what they mean by extremist \" patriot \" groups , who counts , and why .The answers we found may surprise you .What is the \" patriot \" movement ?Contrary to what you might think the \" patriot \" movement as defined by the SPLC does not refer to every person who self - identifies as a patriot , or as patriotic .Rather , it applies to a very specific sect of people who might be more accurately characterized as militant conspiracy theorists with a survivalist streak .From the SPLC 's definition : .Generally , Patriot groups define themselves as opposed to the \" New World Order , \" engage in groundless conspiracy theorizing , or advocate or adhere to extreme antigovernment doctrines .Antigovernment groups do not necessarily advocate or engage in violence or other criminal activities , though some have .Many warn of impending government violence or the need to prepare for a coming revolution .Many antigovernment groups are not racist .Some public figures who SPLC associates with the \" patriot \" movement include former Constitution Party Presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin , radio host Alex Jones and Joseph Farah , publisher of WorldNetDaily .Indeed , the closest SPLC gets to impugning any of the above figures directly through the \" patriot \" movement is in this passage on that movement 's beliefs about Agenda 21 : .A particularly prominent conspiracy in the antigovernment movement is that the United Nations , which is usually seen as spearheading the \" New World Order , \" is imposing a global plan , called Agenda 21 , to take away citizens ' property rights .There is a UN program with that name to develop sustainable communities across the globe .Agenda 21 was agreed to by political leaders from dozens of countries , including the first President Bush .But in typical fashion , these antigovernment activists have twisted it into a global conspiracy .Still , the definition of a member of the \" patriot \" movement invokes more than simple patriotism or conservative beliefs .According to SPLC , it requires a belief in a conspiracy theory concerning the \" New World Order .\" This may describe some conservatives , but it is not an inherently conservative belief .Peter Joseph , author of the Zeitgeist conspiracy theory , pretty clearly identifies as being on the left , and yet he believes the New World Order exists , albeit he refuses to use the term , and conceptualizes it differently from other figures : .As to the definition of \" patriots \" as right - wing , or part of the hard - right , SPLC 's definition of who is on the \" right \" is rather unconventional .For instance , they describe the New Black Panther Party as part of the \" Radical Right \" in spite of the fact that conservatives revile the group .What this suggests is that when the SPLC uses these loaded terms , they are either unintentionally using terminology in a different way from most people , or intentionally using terms that will spur controversy , without actually meaning what their critics assume .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.379684"}

{"text": "The San Francisco Recreation and Parks department does not have an official stance on the plan , but spokespeople expressed the need for the close communication between the city and federal park agencies in order to reach a balanced plan .The public does not make distinctions between which park lands are managed by whom , \" said Sarah Ballard , Public Affairs for SF Rec and Park .\" They just know where they like to go with their dogs , and if there become problems in the parks , then everyone is n't working together efficiently .If it is passed during today 's Board of Supervisors meeting , Wiener 's resolution simply puts the city and county of San Francisco on record as officially opposing the proposal .While invited , representatives from the national park were not present at last week 's hearing .We did not attend because we saw no useful purpose in participating in a meeting where the outcome was predetermined , \" said Howard Levitt , spokesperson for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area .The plan is not expected to be implemented until 2015 , when the Department of the Interior has the final say to adopt it as federal rule .The national recreation area must first allow for an additional public comment period before formalizing a plan that it will submit for federal review .Levitt expressed concern that many who oppose the plan may be misunderstanding the full impact .For example , many portions of parkland that will see restrictions still allow for off - leash areas , albeit smaller .Also , Levitt said it was noteworthy that there are areas currently being used by off - leash dogs that were never technically allowed , it just has n't been enforced .I know this is characterized as a ban on dogs , but nothing could be further from the truth , \" Levitt said .\" Every park user wants to use the same area , whether that means for playing with their dogs or bird watching or having a picnic .We do n't have the luxury of being able to see the issue through a single lens .Our challenge is to provide for a variety of user groups and experiences .Hi John , You are correct that there is no federal parkland in 94110 .But there is most certainly a popular park where people recreate with their dogs ( Mission Dolores ) that could possibly be affected by this proposal , as pointed out by Scott Wiener , who represents portions of the Mission .Thanks for reading , and I hope that clears things up for you !It 's funny that Scott Wiener does n't want more restrictions on dogs but seems to love unnecessarily restricting humans ( eg , the recent ban on public nudity in the city and his latest proposal to close city parks at night ) .There 's something seriously wrong with that guy .Guided By Sound : Crissy Broadcast Debuts in San Francisco .In San Francisco , even our fog posts regularly on Twitter .In real life , you never know for certain when Karl the Fog is going to roll into town , but once he does his presence ca n't be ignored .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.7813"}
