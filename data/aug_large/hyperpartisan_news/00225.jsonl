Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants has begun to report on their situation .( 2 ) When non - citizens leave their countries for migration they can either travel through irregular or regular channels .When using irregular channels migrants take enormous risks by putting their lives in the hands of smuggling and trafficking networks .For example , smugglers may use unsafe means of transportation that jeopardize the lives of the migrants .Migrants may die by suffocation in closed containers or by drowning when an overloaded ship sinks .In some cases State officials may be aware of or even involved in the smuggling efforts .When migrants travel in these conditions they are often intercepted by State agents who use their power to return or detain migrants or , in some cases , to extort bribes from them .There have been cases in which sexual favours have been demanded of undocumented women migrants in order to let them continue on their way ; cases of rape have also been reported in some countries .Having been intercepted migrants are also vulnerable to excessive use of force by security forces as well as mental and physical abuse , particularly due to racist or xenophobic attitudes .Irregular migrants are subject to degrading body searches .Migrants also report confiscation and theft of documents , money , and belongings .When interception leads to detention many countries lack appropriate facilities and migrants are often detained with convicted criminals .Detained migrants may lack access to the courts because their detention is considered administrative and thus means of judicial review is not available .Detention may also be indefinite because it may take several months or far longer to identify the individuals and ascertain their nationality .The country of origin may be unwilling to recognize the individuals as their nationals or to produce travel documents .Even if the country of origin acknowledges their nationals in detention , many migrants are imprisoned in places where there is no consular representation of their country of origin , therefore consular protection may not be available .Where there is a consular office effective protection may depend on the country of origin 's policies and willingness to act on behalf of their nationals .In addition , many countries have penal codes that make it a serious criminal offence ( for example , 1 to 5 years ) to enter a country with or to possess false documents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.86623"}

{"text": "National health statistics rarely reflect the process or its implications , and there has been relatively little interest in the phenomenon by health and social scientists .What data are available tend to be from small studies and anecdotal reports .They nevertheless indicate that the health circumstances that characterize uprooting and migration merit more consideration .Much , of course , depends on the type of population movement , why and where it occurs , and the profiles of the people involved .Migrants moving because of poverty arrive with health profiles typical of those in their previous surroundings .Poverty breeds diseases of poverty no matter where or when it exists .The range of health issues that can be associated with migration is inevitably broad .It includes Communicable and noncommunicable diseases , injuries associated with work environments , and psychological problems .All or any of them can be debilitating to the health of migrants and their families .They can also have serious consequences for societies and communities into which they move and work .Communicable and noncommunicable diseases , as well as occupational injuries , psychosocial problems , and family breakdown , can all be equally important with regard to the care and treatment required to deal with them and the work and school days that can be lost because of them .The health of migrants thus has social and economic consequences for host countries as well as for migrants and their families .The process of migration within and into the EU includes changing and emerging trends in health .TB is a disease of poverty , and it is not surprising that migrants from poor countries are at high risk of contracting it .Much could be done to avoid TB by ensuring better standards of living for low income migrants who must often deal with poor housing and overcrowded conditions .Early identification and treatment of TB is also important and screening should be seen as a way of identifying people who need treatment .However , associating health screening with the possibility of expulsion does little to encourage migrants to participate and indeed may defeat the whole purpose of it .Illegal immigrants are possibly at particularly high risk of TB and reluctant to be tested for fear of being expelled .Screening for other diseases such as hepatitis , which also constitutes a growing threat , could also be useful if it is done in a constructive way .Problems associated with maternal and child health among migrants have long been a matter of concern in most EU countries .Migrant women make poor use of contraceptive services and have more difficult pregnancies than other women .They have more low - birth - weight babies and tend to deliver prematurely more often .In some countries , migrant women also terminate pregnancies more often than other women .In some migrant communities , women are still regarded as second - class citizens .Different cultural practices within families and attitudes toward women often seriously limit their access to , and use of , antenatal care and other services .Conflicting pressures are brought to bear on women caught between traditional domestic values and practices and those of the social environment they work and live in and thus confront women with difficult psychological barriers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.43247"}
{"text": "African immigrant women giving birth in hospitals , for example , have an incidence of premature births almost twice as high as in Spanish women , and low - birth - weight rates are also approximately double those of women born in Spain .In the case of babies born to women from Central and South America , over 8 % are underweight and 6.3 % are born prematurely .Occupational Health and Safety Among Immigrants .Migrants tend to take jobs that are temporary , require few skills , and are largely unattractive to local labor forces .Many jobs that are available , such as those in mining , construction , heavy manufacturing , industry , and agriculture , often involve poor environmental conditions and lack of safety .Because temporary labor markets are often seen as too short - term to justify major investments in training , employers tend not to require instruction and careful supervision .Language obstacles , poor communication , lack of familiarity with some of the technology used , and different attitudes to work safety all contribute to work - related risks .The number of industrial accidents and injuries is higher among migrant workers than among citizens in France and Germany , especially those who work in construction and public works types of jobs .Over 30 % of all accidents resulting in permanent disabilities involve non - nationals .Data from Belgium similarly indicate that Moroccan and Turkish workers in heavy industry have a higher incidence of accidents than Belgian nationals and suffer more secondary psychological sequelae .In the agricultural sector , unprotected exposure to pesticides and other chemical products is a common problem , and chronic exposure to them has been linked to depression , neurologic disorders , and miscarriages among migrant workers in Spain .The incidence of other injuries among people working in greenhouses is also high , and muscular disease , dehydration , and heart complaints linked to high temperatures are common .Few agricultural workers receive much safety training , and few use effective protection .Because many agricultural businesses are small and harvests seasonal , health authorities tend to have limited access to them , and little routine evaluation of working conditions and safety takes place .Domestic Accidents and Poisonings Among Immigrant Children .Immigrants also tend to be more vulnerable to other types of accidents .In Germany , non - German children 5 to 9 years old have more traffic and other accidents than German children .Children of Moroccan and Turkish migrant workers in the Netherlands also have more domestic accidents such as poisonings and burns , as well as traffic accidents , than Dutch children .Poor quality housing is often a risk factor , and in France , lead poisoning from paint in old , poorly maintained houses is a major problem for migrant children .The frequent absence of one or both parents due to heavy work schedules , along with poor childcare alternatives available to immigrants also contributes to putting children of migrants at risk .Psychosocial Issues Among Immigrants .Underlying many of these health issues are the psychosocial determinants of health - related behavior .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.64029"}
