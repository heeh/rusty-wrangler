{"text": "Because of their short half - lives , these drugs leave the body and brain so rapidly that they can shock the brain into potentially life - threatening seizures .It took me 3 seizures from trying to get off Xanax on my own before I got some tips from people on this forum ( milo ?Francoise ? ) about what was really going on .I learned that , for anyone going off of these drugs after being on them for months or years , it is extremely important to first switch to a long - half - life drug like Valium ( or Klonopin ) before tapering slowly off of the drug .While Xanax has a half life of 11 hours , Valium has a half - life of almost 200 hours per dose .Valium is also a relatively big pill , meaning you have the opportunity to break the pill down into gradually smaller and smaller doses to give yourself a smooth , safe taper .But Ativan , for example , is already only .5 to 1 mg or so , so it 's very hard to break the pill down to taper with .Plus , even if you could shave the pill down gradually , the short half life would still present the danger of shocking your brain into a seizure .Since my doctor switched me to Valium , I 've been slowly tapering down , but now I do n't fear those horrible seizures , which can be life - threatening .The valium leaves the body so slowly , that it 's gradually becoming less and less likely that I will experience any more seizures .As far as the difference in effect , all these drugs are eventually metabolized by the body into diazepine -- it 's just a matter of how fast and how long - lasting .So , be warned , but do n't be afraid -- now that you know -- when you want to discontinue the Xanax , first have your doctor switch you to Valium for the period of your taper .This will help keep you safe from sudden withdrawal seizures and give you a slow , comfortable detox with a minimum of discomfort .It 's shocking how many doctors do n't even know this , causing them to just cut their patients off and put they 're lives at risk needlessly .Patient , educate thyself !By the way , the warning signs of an impending benzo - withdrawal seizure are typically numbness in the hands and feet , aura , extreme muscle tension , extreme anxiety , tight chest , shallow breathing .But it 's the numb hands that are the biggest giveaway that a seizure is imminent .If you 're tapering off benzos and you experience some or all of these symptoms , get to your doctor or to an ER ASAP ! !Remember , you could have a benzo - related seizure behind the wheel of a car and kill innocent people .Just food for thought .Now , the criminal part , mmmmm , your name is n't Soprano , is it ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.318535"}

{"text": "The next morning , Riedel admitted to officers he had been drinking .According to court documents , he said he did n't remember running over Flower .At one point , Riedel faced a felony hit - and - run charge .These days , his record is clean , thanks to Columbia County District Attorney Jane Kohlwey and Riedel 's attorney , Bruce Rosen of Madison .Rather than potentially stand trial on the charges , Riedel was offered a deferred prosecution agreement .Under Wisconsin law , a deferred prosecution agreement allows a person facing criminal charges to fulfill certain conditions in return for a dismissal of the charges against them .To be eligible , the offender , in this case Riedel , usually does not have a criminal record , must be willing to participate in the agreement and accepts responsibility for the crime .An investigation by the Baraboo News Republic , a sister publication to The Capital Times , revealed that Kohlwey pledged to destroy documents that detailed what Riedel would do to get the charges against him dismissed .Meanwhile , Flower was kept in the dark .Last August , the manner in which this case was handled caused the Crime Victims Rights Board , an independent agency with staff support from the Wisconsin Department of Justice , to reprimand Kohlwey for her handling of the case .With no felony conviction , Riedel could continue to own and operate a gun .The deal saved his career .In an interview with the News Republic in December , Kohlwey said saving Riedel 's career was not her intent and that entering into the \" secret agreement \" to keep the conditions of the deferred prosecution agreement confidential was a \" serious judgment error .While the charges against Riedel still were pending , Hillsboro Police Chief Thomas Richardson needed to fill a part - time spot on his small staff , a staff that included himself , another full - time officer and two part - time officers .Richardson said when he called Riedel 's attorney and authorities in Sauk County , he was told the charges against Riedel were going to be dismissed .With no conviction pending , Richardson said he felt comfortable hiring Riedel as his third part - time officer .He is a very good officer , and therefore he is still working here , \" Richardson said .\" From what I understand , he got messed up with the wrong girl .Like Riedel , Henderson -- the Madison officer who was fired -- also received a deferred prosecution deal .He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and making a telephone threat connected to an incident with his stepson and was terminated from the department in 2006 , but the charges against him were dismissed after he completed the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement .Henderson 's domestic violence issues came to light after he allegedly put his wife 's 15-year - old son in a headlock and slammed him into a door in 2004 .His wife told officers investigating the incident with her son that she had twice called police to report domestic violence incidents , but when they arrived , she told them that nothing happened because she feared Henderson would lose his job .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.89032"}

{"text": "Short - acting benzos like Xanax and Ativan work fine while you 're on them .The problem occurs when they 're abruptly discontinued .Because of their short half - lives , these drugs leave the body and brain so rapidly that they can shock the brain into potentially life - threatening seizures .It took me 3 seizures from trying to get off Xanax on my own before I got some tips from people on this forum ( milo ?Francoise ? ) about what was really going on .I learned that , for anyone going off of these drugs after being on them for months or years , it is extremely important to first switch to a long - half - life drug like Valium ( or Klonopin ) before tapering slowly off of the drug .While Xanax has a half life of 11 hours , Valium has a half - life of almost 200 hours per dose .Valium is also a relatively big pill , meaning you have the opportunity to break the pill down into gradually smaller and smaller doses to give yourself a smooth , safe taper .But Ativan , for example , is already only .5 to 1 mg or so , so it 's very hard to break the pill down to taper with .Plus , even if you could shave the pill down gradually , the short half life would still present the danger of shocking your brain into a seizure .Since my doctor switched me to Valium , I 've been slowly tapering down , but now I do n't fear those horrible seizures , which can be life - threatening .The valium leaves the body so slowly , that it 's gradually becoming less and less likely that I will experience any more seizures .As far as the difference in effect , all these drugs are eventually metabolized by the body into diazepine -- it 's just a matter of how fast and how long - lasting .So , be warned , but do n't be afraid -- now that you know -- when you want to discontinue the Xanax , first have your doctor switch you to Valium for the period of your taper .This will help keep you safe from sudden withdrawal seizures and give you a slow , comfortable detox with a minimum of discomfort .It 's shocking how many doctors do n't even know this , causing them to just cut their patients off and put they 're lives at risk needlessly .Patient , educate thyself !By the way , the warning signs of an impending benzo - withdrawal seizure are typically numbness in the hands and feet , aura , extreme muscle tension , extreme anxiety , tight chest , shallow breathing .But it 's the numb hands that are the biggest giveaway that a seizure is imminent .If you 're tapering off benzos and you experience some or all of these symptoms , get to your doctor or to an ER ASAP ! !Remember , you could have a benzo - related seizure behind the wheel of a car and kill innocent people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.67401"}

{"text": "The abuse of powers rampant in our schools these days is intolerable . \"Judge drops PFA order against Glodzik .The assault claim made against Leo Glodzik III by an ex - lover was a classic case of her word against his , a judge said Thursday in dismissing a protection from abuse order the woman filed against the embattled towing contractor .While Aleksandra O'Donohue testified at a hearing that Glodzik beat her , she did n't present corroborating evidence to support the allegations , Luzerne County President Judge Thomas F. Burke Jr. said .The judge said he was particularly swayed by the testimony of two Wilkes - Barre police officers who showed up at Glodzik 's home on April 17 on the report of an intoxicated and out - of - control female causing a disturbance .Sgt .Charles Casey and Officer Alan Gribble , who eventually arrested the Nanticoke woman on public drunkenness and disorderly conduct charges , said an extremely drunken O'Donohue did n't have any visible injuries and never alleged abuse by Glodzik before shouting vulgar slurs and spitting on them .At one point , they inquired about a single bruise on her leg and she said it was caused by another man and told them it was \" none of your ( expletive ) business , \" they said .The ruling was a victory for Glodzik , who has various other legal battles ahead of him , including a criminal trial starting Monday on allegations he pocketed $ 2,100 in bait money in an FBI sting operation after a tow .Glodzik , owner of LAG Towing , was Wilkes - Barre 's exclusive towing contractor from April 2005 until his May 31 , 2013 arrest for the alleged theft .Glodzik 's attorney Joseph Sklarosky Sr . , who has called the theft case \" bogus , \" said the ruling was the start of the vindication process for Glodzik .\" Have you read the papers lately - the last year and a half ?It 's nice to win one , \" he said .O'Donohue 's attorney Andrew Katsock argued it 's possible , and likely , the cops were more apt to take Glodzik 's side because he developed a cozy relationship with police officers during his time as the city 's towing contractor .The Citizens ' Voice has previously reported the FBI is looking at possible connections among Wilkes - Barre police officers , auto loans and Glodzik as part of a wider investigation , but that issue was not raised on Thursday .On the night in question , Katsock noted Glodzik bypassed the county 911 dispatch center and summoned police to his Morgan Drive home by calling several officers on their personal cell phones .He got Casey to admit he and Glodzik are friends and he once attended a social function at Glodzik 's home years ago .Gribble , one of the officers Glodzik contacted directly on the phone , seemed insulted his integrity was being questioned after 20 years on the force .\" I 'm not going to screw that up for anybody , \" Gribble told Katsock .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.21817"}
