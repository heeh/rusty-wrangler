{"text": "Playing this season against the minnows of SFL3 Rangers averaged attendance of 45,750 , compared to 46,324 last season when they played in the Scottish Premier League .Clearly the people attending these games believed they support a team with a rich history founded in 1872 , not 2012 .Thus in my view the treatment of Rangers should be considered a punishment .Both sides argue about the legitimacy of this treatment , but as the figures above show , Rangers have not lost much in the way of support , and many observers have pointed to a greater intensity in that support , fostered by the sense of victimization .The club easily won the division and were promoted to SFL2 , and it would be surprising if they were not back in the SPL in two years .How they are doing financially is less clear .But my guess is that things are looking good .The wages of the current squad will be well below what they paid when in the SPL , although they broadcast income will be substantially less .But shorn of their debts and with the support they enjoy , I think they will prosper .So what of the SPL clubs ?In 2012/13 , just looking at the clubs that were present in both seasons , attendance fell by 4.6 % .Below is a table showing the percentage changes for each of the clubs , as well as the difference in their league positions .Motherwell .Saint Johnstone .Saint Mirren .Six out of the ten teams lost attendance , while the remaining four showed small increases .These changes do not seem particularly affected by league performance .And what of the finances of the SPL clubs ?Last month Hearts went into administration , and while it was in financial difficulties even before the Rangers expulsion , the absence of a big home gate against them ca n't have helped .Ironically Hearts asked Rangers to play a friendly against them this summer to help with cashflow , but there 's precious little friendship now between Rangers and SPL clubs , and they refused .So , referring back to my earlier blog , I would still argue that the punishment of Rangers was not a smart one , and there were smarter ways to do it .Others have argued that keeping Rangers in the SPL would have led to mass boycotts by enraged fans of the other SPL clubs .Maybe , but I seriously doubt it .In any case , I think it 's clear that the punishers have been hurt by the punishment .Perhaps not that much , and perhaps embittered fans feel it was a price worth paying .But it does serve to illustrate the paradox of sporting competition .A good contest involves intense rivalry .Which means that the rivals actually need each other- eliminate your rival and you are the loser .I buy what you 're saying , but in an even bigger picture , I see an overall benefit for the SPL .Rangers not only have better wage issues , but fewer travel considerations to deal with too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.977356"}
{"text": "\" A good contest involves intense rivalry .Which means that the rivals actually need each other- eliminate your rival and you are the loser . \"Which , in the most part , in this particular instance , means Celtic .No other SPL club has that truly intense rivalry with Rangers .Lets look at the impact this has had on Celtic in more detail .As you say average attendances are down by almost 76,000 .As far as I recall the average price for a SPL game at Celtic Park last season was \u00a3 28 .That is a loss of \u00a3 2,128,000 .It is a league , with no offense meant to any other club , that is all but over before it starts .Now for arguments sake I 'll leave the figure at \u00a3 2.1 m for this season and the next even though Celtic have reduced their season ticket price considerably this year .So in the bare minimum three seasons that Rangers are out of the SPL , in league gate money terms , Celtic are down by \u00a3 6.3 m ( all other things being equal . )I think if you ask anyone at Celtic if they would be prepared to take a hit of \u00a3 6.3 m over three years for a literally unfettered crack at the Champions League for three seasons , they would bite the hand off you .They need to make it there once and they have more than made their losses up .UEFA 's own figures state Celtic made \u00a3 23,670,000 from their Champions League adventure last season .So what are Celtic getting in return for this \u00a3 2.1 m ?As was very evident last season Celtic were inconsistent in the SPL and arguably over - achieving in the Champions League , there was no pressure at home , no Rangers to keep them competitive week in week out , in short , they became a midweek team .All energies were focused on performing on Tuesdays and Wednesdays .Saturdays and Sundays ?Well there were 38 of them to get it right seemed to be the philosophy .Alex Ferguson always said Manchester United did n't get motoring in their domestic league till December and lo and behold after the Champions League groups were over ( December 5th ) Celtic won 10 of their next 11 SPL games .Their league lead went from 3 points to 18 during this run all but guaranteeing the title .In my opinion this is a very significant factor in why Rangers being out of the SPL is really not harmful to Celtic .Giving certain players a rest prior to a Champions League game was commonplace last season , would that have been the case in a competitive title race with Rangers ?Not a chance .In both 2003 and 2008 arguably the best team in the division lost the league .Both Celtic ( in 2003 ) and Rangers ( in 2008 ) wilted under the demands of getting to the UEFA Cup Final .Celtic had no such concerns last season , this season and most likely next season .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.981514"}

{"text": "It 's quite right that all claims of sexual assault should be investigated , tested and , where there is a case , pursued through the judicial system .No one is above the law , whether a ' celebrity ' or a lord .But we seem to have lost a sense of perspective when it comes to these crimes with vast resources being allocated to a handful of cases while many thousands of reported incidents are virtually on hold .The police should never have to apologise for investigating crimes and following leads .However , if allegations are false or can not be substantiated they should say so .This would be a strength not a weakness .It is , of course , difficult that in many of the high - profile cases of recent times the identities of those under investigation have not been officially released by the police but have come to light through other means .Yet we have to deal with the world as it is not as we wish it would be and once names are common knowledge the results of the investigations centring on them should be made public .When it emerges that someone in the public eye is being investigated for non - recent child abuse it obviously stirs the interest of the media whose appetite can be insatiable .This puts pressure on the police who do n't want to repeat the mistakes of the past by allowing offenders to slip through their hands .And so there is a danger , as has been seen in recent cases , that officers lack confidence in declaring there is a lack of evidence or the allegations are not true .The disproportionate weight of media attention given to say , Sir Edward Heath , as opposed to the Bradford grooming gang sentenced this week , shows there is a danger the pendulum is swinging too far the other way .This threatens the painstaking work invested in ensuring the public and our institutions recognise child abuse as a very real danger .Whilst high profile cases have helped the cause there is now a real risk that the all - encompassing focus on them does both victims of abuse and those advocating on their behalf a fundamental disservice .As the public watches high -profile cases collapsing amidst a media fanfare genuine convictions made across the country week in week out go virtually unannounced .If this trend continues they may start to believe that child sexual abuse is n't the prolific problem we know it to be .So , now the Goddard Inquiry is in full swing , taking evidence about allegations of child sex crimes involving ' well known people ' as well as institutional abuse , how do we ensure we do n't fail today 's victims ?If they start to think their stories are going to be diminished by the continuing furore over how some senior public figures have been treated by the police they will stay silent .Therefore we have to continue to encourage them to come forward , to give them the confidence of knowing they will be listened to .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.52569"}
{"text": "Of course Celtic have over 50,000 season ticket holders and thousands more on the waiting list .But these fans are not buying season tickets so that they can watch Celts demolish Dundee United or hump Hibs .The main reasons for buying a season ticket are threefold .A holder is guaranteed a seat twice a season for the Rangers games .A season ticket is the passport to tickets for European ties .And , finally , it ensures the holder gets in to Parkhead for all League matches .The first reason remains unchallenged .But the second is looking dodgy .At the very best a run to the quarter - finals could produce opposition of a comparable attraction to that of the first phase of the Champions League .But the last time Celtic played in the last eight of a European competition you could record the highlights on a Betamax video .Somehow McCann managed to persuade the supporters that the only way they would be guaranteed one of the 60,000 seats at Celtic Park was to buy a season ticket .Previously , Celtic could fill their ground for the Old Firm games and big European ties - just like today .But for other domestic fixtures there was no great demand .Sure , if it was a title - clinching match or if a provincial side was making a rare championship challenge then more than 60,000 would roll up at Parkhead .But those fixtures were few and far between .Other than for a handful of matches , Celtic Park was usually half - full - or less .Their rivals had pulled the same stroke when rebuilding Ibrox .But McCann upped the ante .But now the first stirrings of rebellion can be detected .Celtic supporters are happy to take out loans and fork out a small fortune in July if it gets them a guarantee that they can shell out more to see Real Madrid , Man Utd or Juventus in the Champions League .When ( not if ) the day comes when that waiting list no longer wants to take up their season tickets , Celtic are in big trouble .The loss of 20,000 - 30,000 season ticket holders would be devastating as all the cash collected up front and gathering interest vanishes to be replaced by half as many people paying once a fortnight .The only way out of this downward spiral is success in Europe .Lest anyone think this article is prejudiced against the boys in green , the same holds true for Rangers as well .The difference is that with those extra 10,000 seats , Celtic have more to lose .Nor is it restricted to Scotland .The most recent round of games in the English premiership saw six of the ten fixtures sold out .Once fans spot the empty places around them they start to question the wisdom of their own purchase .At Celtic Park , those gaps have started to appear .For the Scottish Cup 1873 - 1939 click here For the Scottish Cup Post-1945 click here For the League Cup from 1946 click here Scottish Premier League : Smith Reveals More Than Intended About Tainted Title .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.58326"}

Irish Celtic players Paddy McCourt and Niall McGinn .The bullets were sent to the players in January , and subsequently , appearances by both players became a rarity .The assault on Neil Lennon at Tynecastle last week followed about 45 seconds of Heart of Midlothian fans chanting , \" You 're getting shot in the morning . \"As Lennon 's assailant was led away by Lothian and Borders police officers , a large number of Hearts fans applauded him up the tunnel .What Celtic has faced this season has been an intolerable campaign of hate , intimidation and attempted murder .Against that backdrop , how can any reasonable person think that it even matters who wins the title ?Walter Smith is fully aware of the depths of depravity to which Scottish football , and the fans of his club in particular , have sunk this season .He knows that they have no real cause for celebration .Celtic were never allowed to compete this season due to the efforts of the refereeing fraternity , the governing body and Rangers fans .Add to that the ridiculously easy ride Rangers were allowed in the closing weeks of the season .Let 's have a look at Rangers ' record against their top six opponents , before and after the league split : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.80333"}

' .He must have known that one or two of his 792,000 fans would leap to his defence .But it was too late .Daley fans were in no mood for forgiveness : like bloodhounds on the scent of a terrified fox , they pursued their victim , intent on tearing him to pieces .Sky got hold of the story : .But no retraction , excuse , remorse or apology was acceptable .Cornered , wide - eyed , he panicked as his hate - club swelled and his followers soared from the low hundreds to 50,000 , The scorn and abuse poured in .The baying mob cast their judgmental stones of hate , and Reece responded in kind : .Of course , these threats were part of entire threads of unpleasantness being targeted at Reece .Things clearly escalated .Twitter hashtags appeared , like # ThingsBetterThanRiley69 , in response to which the mob consensus appears to be ' being the middle person in The Human Centipede ' .They wished him ill , harm , and deeply unpleasant trauma .One of the earliest tweets was an expression of hope that he might burn to death .Reece is a boy ; boys need to save face .Bravado , boasting , exaggerating , threatening ...Such tweets are interesting in the context of the recent ' Twitter Joke Trial ' , in which an irate passenger apparently threatened to blow up Robin Hood airport because the weather had caused flight cancellations and frustration .He was initially convicted of sending a ' menacing ' communication .The Crown Prosecution Service took him to court under the 2003 Communications Act , and Doncaster magistrates told him to pay \u00a3 600 costs , a \u00a3 385 fine and a \u00a3 15 victim surcharge .The conviction in May 2010 was later upheld by a Crown Court judge .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.975945"}
{"text": "When it emerges that someone in the public eye is being investigated for non - recent child abuse it obviously stirs the interest of the media whose appetite can be insatiable .This puts pressure on the police who do n't want to repeat the mistakes of the past by allowing offenders to slip through their hands .And so there is a danger , as has been seen in recent cases , that officers lack confidence in declaring there is a lack of evidence or the allegations are not true .The disproportionate weight of media attention given to say , Sir Edward Heath , as opposed to the Bradford grooming gang sentenced this week , shows there is a danger the pendulum is swinging too far the other way .This threatens the painstaking work invested in ensuring the public and our institutions recognise child abuse as a very real danger .Whilst high profile cases have helped the cause there is now a real risk that the all - encompassing focus on them does both victims of abuse and those advocating on their behalf a fundamental disservice .As the public watches high -profile cases collapsing amidst a media fanfare genuine convictions made across the country week in week out go virtually unannounced .If this trend continues they may start to believe that child sexual abuse is n't the prolific problem we know it to be .So , now the Goddard Inquiry is in full swing , taking evidence about allegations of child sex crimes involving ' well known people ' as well as institutional abuse , how do we ensure we do n't fail today 's victims ?If they start to think their stories are going to be diminished by the continuing furore over how some senior public figures have been treated by the police they will stay silent .Therefore we have to continue to encourage them to come forward , to give them the confidence of knowing they will be listened to .If we do n't we will find ourselves back in those incestuous days where people conspired to say and do nothing to prevent child abuse .TRIAL OFFER .12 issues for \u00a3 12 + FREE book .Good journalism is expensive .We notice you have ad blocking software enabled .Support the New Statesman 's quality , independent journalism by contributing now - and this message will disappear for the next 30 days .If we can not support the site on advertising revenue , we will have to introduce a pay wall - meaning fewer readers will have access to our incisive analysis , comprehensive culture coverage and groundbreaking long reads .Foreign Policy Magazine took a trip to Benghazi for an interview and found more documents at the consulate , a month and a half after the attack on 9/11 .These documents confirm that Amb .Stevens had requested more security from the Libyan government but was disappointed when it did n't arrive and asked Libyan authorities to investigate .He also noted that a member of the police force was seen photographing the consulate from a building across the street on the day of the attack .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.22758"}
