Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton , and chairman of BKSH 's parent , Burson - Marsteller Inc. , itself a WPP subsidiary .It 's tough enough to link the dots when the players have a bit of a public profile in the U.S. , like Yurgens .But sometimes there are no dots to connect .From August 2002 until August 2003 , BKSH registered to lobby the House and Senate on behalf of a London - based firm named Cavendish Digicom Inc. for \" public education and the support of democracy in Iran .\" There 's virtually no record of such a firm , anywhere , save a lapsed registration by a company with that name in the British Virgin Islands , a leading offshore financial center .Riva Levinson , one of two lobbyists registered to act on behalf of Cavendish for BKSH now has her own consulting company , but she also declined to discuss her one - time client .Cavendish 's home is a four - unit apartment building in northwest London .A woman answering a doorbell via intercom in the basement apartment confirmed that it was the office of Cavendish and asked who her caller was .When the visitor identified herself as a Chicago Tribune reporter , she spoke inaudibly to someone else on her side of the door , returned and said , \" Sorry , we do n't know anything about that \" and denied any connection to Cavendish .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.48056"}

Birnbaum and John Solomon Washington Post January 25 , 2008 ; A01 .A top political adviser in Sen. John McCain 's presidential campaign helped arrange an introduction in 2006 between McCain and a Russian billionaire whose suspected links to anti - democratic and organized - crime figures are so controversial that the U.S. government revoked his visa .Rick Davis , who is now McCain 's campaign manager , helped set up the encounter between McCain and Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska in Switzerland during an international economic conference .At the time , Davis was working for a lobbying firm and seeking to do business with the billionaire .There is no evidence that McCain did anything for Deripaska after they met at a social gathering over drinks and dinner .Deripaska was grateful for the introduction , writing a thank - you note to Davis and his partner and offering to assist them in a subsequent business deal , according to a copy of the note obtained by The Washington Post .With a net worth of more than $ 13 billion , Deripaska is one of the richest men in Russia and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin .McCain has been one of Putin 's sharpest U.S. critics , calling for Russia to be kicked out of the Group of Eight industrialized nations because of Putin 's anti - democratic activities .The Arizona Republican has also repeatedly complained about the negative impact of Kremlin - linked oligarchs such as Deripaska .When Deripaska met McCain , Davis was part of Davis Manafort , a lobbying firm that was being paid to provide political advice to pro - Russian and oligarch - funded candidates in Ukraine , according to interviews and news accounts .At the same time , McCain was publicly supporting those candidates ' Western - oriented democratic rivals .The socializing with Deripaska provides a case study in the challenges faced by McCain , a longtime foe of Washington lobbyists who has a well - known lobbyist as his top political aide .Davis , who has been a political adviser to McCain on and off since 1999 , was part of a lobbying firm that worked not only for Ukrainian politicians but also for telecommunications firms , a lottery services provider and freight companies .Mark Salter , a spokesman for McCain , said that meetings with Deripaska took place during official trips abroad by senators and that McCain did nothing improper . \" Any contact between Mr. Deripaska and the senator was social and incidental , \" he added .Salter said the contact between McCain and Deripaska did not constitute a \" private meeting \" ; both men were part of larger gatherings .Davis declined to comment , saying by e - mail that his activities regarding Deripaska \" all relate to my private business and have nothing to do with Senator John McCain . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.21682"}

Syron , Freddie Mac 's chief executive , arranged for a new contract with Davis & Manafort , at the reduced rate of $ 15,000 a month , they said .Mr. Syron lost his job in the government takeover this month .Mr. McLoughlin , who through a spokeswoman declined to comment , was a former chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady in the first President Bush 's administration , and has longstanding Republican ties .Mr. Davis was hired as a consultant , not a lobbyist , the officials said .Davis & Manafort in recent years has filed federal lobbying reports for a number of companies but not Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae .Later in 2006 , Mr. Davis was working on Mr. McCain 's emerging presidential campaign , as chief financial officer .The only thing that Freddie Mac officials could recall Mr. Davis doing for the company was the October 2006 pre - election forum with mid - level and senior executives who contribute to Freddie PAC , the company 's political action committee .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.19989"}

{"text": "But that ca n't change the fact that when it comes to his record , all the way up until Thursday of last week , John McCain is \" The Fundamental Deregulator \" -- and YouTube is here to prove it : .Early on Tuesday , Barack Obama 's presidential campaign launched an ad in Michigan pointing out that , despite assurances that he only purchased domestic , three of John McCain 's 13 cars were foreign - made .The spot was designed to paint McCain as both removed from his straight - talking reputation and not a true champion of the domestic auto industry .If that is the case , however , the Obama campaign left a far more effective salvo lying on the table .Not only does McCain buy foreign .Several high - ranking members of his campaign and fundraising team have earned nearly $ 2.4 million lobbying on behalf of foreign auto manufacturers .According to the non - partisan Campaign Money Watch , John Green , McCain 's congressional liaison , earned $ 130,000 to lobby on behalf of the Association of International Car Manufacturers in 2007 and 2008 .Susan Nelson , the Senator 's finance director , made $ 460,000 lobbying for Toyota from 2005 to 2007 .Tom Loeffler , the campaign 's former finance chair ( and McCain bundler ) made $ 660,000 lobbying for Toyota during that same time period .While Josephine Cooper and David Vennett -- each fundraisers for the campaign -- have both worked as Toyota 's in - house lobbyists since 2004 .Meanwhile , Kristen Gullot , who fundraises for McCain and serves on his steering committee of women , made $ 840,000 lobbying for Toyota from 2005 through 2008 .And Susan Molinari , another member of the steering committee of women for McCain , made $ 300,000 lobbying for Hyundai in 2001 and 2002 .\" When John McCain tells Michigan voters that their jobs are n't coming back , he 's apparently speaking with inside information , \" said David Donnelly , director of Campaign Money Watch . \"He is receiving fundraising help and advice from a half dozen lobbyists who have also made millions working for foreign car manufacturers .\" All of the entities that these advisers and aides lobbied for were U.S. subsidiaries of foreign manufacturers .And both of these companies have thousands of American - based employees .In all likelihood , McCain 's cars were built in the United States and not overseas .But domestic car companies , and the workers they employ , are naturally skittish of the foreign competition .And as the Obama campaign signaled this morning , they will take advantage of any potential to shift votes in Michigan .As such , it would not be a huge surprise to see the Illinois Democrat point out the lobbyist connections that McCain has to these foreign producers .Before Sarah Palin decided to run for the Wasilla mayor 's office in 1996 against incumbent John Stein , the Palins and Steins were friends .John Stein had helped launch Palin 's political career , mentoring the hockey mom during her 1994 run for City Council , along with veteran council member Nick Carney .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.25488"}
