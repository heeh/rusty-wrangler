{"text": "So what is going on ?To win the Democratic nomination , a candidate must obtain a certain number of delegates -- individuals who will cast votes at the DNC convention this summer .But there are two types of delegates in the Democratic party : pledged delegates , which are generally based on vote count , and unpledged delegates , or superdelegates .The latter include former and current Democratic leaders and elected officials , including presidents , vice presidents , governors and senators .They can select the candidate of their choosing , wherever they want and whenever they want - and can switch at any time .Sanders leads in pledged delegates ; he has 36 while Clinton has 32 , according to ABC News estimates .But Clinton has a huge lead in superdelegates , with 362 to Sanders ' 8 .( There are a total of 712 superdelegates ) .In New Hampshire for instance , Clinton currently has the support of 6 of the state 's 8 superdelegates , which accounts for her total win of 15 delegates .Sanders picked up none ( two have yet to decide ) .This count has angered Sanders ' supporters , who are claiming the establishment is rigged against their candidate of choice .MoveOn.org , which endorsed Sanders earlier this year , started a petition to tell the superdelegates to honor the will of the voters .As of today , the petition has over 130,000 signatures . \" In a close race , Superdelegates can snatch that victory away , \" the petition reads .\" Only by pushing back against this possibility can we ensure that the candidate WE vote for becomes the nominee . \"As stated above , these superdelegates can switch their allegiance at any time .Just because they are supporting Clinton now does n't mean they have to do so in July .And in 2008 , that scenario materialized .Clinton originally had a large superdelegate lead over then - Senator Barack Obama .When it became clear that Obama had a stronger likelihood of becoming the nominee , superdelegates who had originally pledged their support for Clinton switched to Obama .By May 2008 , Obama had narrowed that lead to 1 , according to a CNN report .In a statement to ABC News , the Democratic National Committee emphasized that the only delegates awarded in Tuesday night 's primary were the pledged ones .\" Let 's be clear , the only delegates at stake on Tuesday in New Hampshire 's First in the Nation primaries were 24 pledged delegates , \" DNC press secretary Mark Paustenbach wrote in an email to ABC .US Congress ( NEW YORK ) -- Bernie Sanders met with Rev.
