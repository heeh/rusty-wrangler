{"text": "PARIS - HELENE and Christian de Maredsous have just brought a new baby into their Paris home .And although they are thrilled with their third daughter , Camille , they would still like to have a son - so in a couple of years they will likely try to have a fourth child .Families with numerous children such as the Maredsous are becoming a rarity in France .The country had long stood apart from the trend of most other European countries toward low birthrates .But statistics released last week show that , while the French have yet to sour on child bearing to the extent that the Spanish , Italians , and Germans have , the trend here toward fewer children is accelerating .France is still resisting [ the trend ] compared to most other countries of the European Union , ' ' says Guy Desplanques , a demographer with the National Institute of Demographic Studies here . ''But the decreases we 're registering [ in fecundity ] are nevertheless quite strong , and for the first time we 're seeing the decrease ' ' at all ages .After a stable rate during much of the 1980s that averaged about 1.8 children per French woman , the rate in 1992 dropped to 1.73 .New statistics released by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies ( INSEE ) show that the rate in 1993 dropped to 1.65 .That rate , well below the 2.1 required for long - term population stability , is still above Spain 's 1.23 , Italy 's 1.26 , Germany 's 1.3 , and Belgium 's 1.56 .France 's population is still growing - by about 300,000 last year , to 57.8 million - and will continue to grow until the end of the decade , Mr. Desplanques says .After that , France could join other European countries where deaths outnumber births .For ' ' aging ' ' countries , the consequences of a weak birthrate are that fewer young workers will be paying to support a larger retired population .The country 's falling birthrate has led some groups , including the far - right National Front , to advocate heftier ' ' pro - birth ' ' policies to encourage young couples to have more children .Public policy can have an influence : Many specialists credit fiscal and other ' ' pro - family ' ' policies for giving Sweden its high birthrate : 2.09 .In Sweden , child care is universally available and free , parental leave is generous and remunerated .In France , too , econometric studies show France 's existing pro - natality policies have tended to boost the country 's birthrates slightly , Desplanques says .But many French believe such policies are less generous than they were after World War II .High unemployment and the severe recession of the past few years have no doubt discouraged women from bringing more little French into the world .So , too , has another trend revealed in INSEE 's study : Marriages recorded in 1993 fell 40 percent below the number of 20 years ago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.917046"}

{"text": "Anecdotally though , it does seem that there 's something of a U - shaped correlation between fertility and gender equality , with the social attitudes of somewhere like Italy or Singapore being typical of the ' trough ' .East German women who do n't have children leave to pursue careers in the West ?A possibility , sure .The Franco - German comparison seems more telling , I think .Do n't forget Iran .Apparently fertility in urban Iran is approaching lowest - low levels , unaided by policies of the Islamic Republic which include limiting the opportunities women might have for higher education and setting up internet dating .Being from France , I can help with the answer : it 's because of African and Muslim immigration .People of African / Muslim origin ( even after 3 - 4 generations like today so that ca n't be found in any french stats ) have more children .And they are a lot in France .Without them , the FTR would be at best 1.7 maybe lower like in all Europe .Anyway , someone who writes that traditional family is an ideological construct and other PC nonsense like that ca n't be taken seriously .Traditional family is the basis of all civilizations .By the way just check the only western countries where fertility is still high like Ireland and in fact , only Israel is left : in these countries the family is still very traditional . @Benj : National TFRs for France are boosted by immigrant / immigrant background fertility in the same way and even much the same degree that national TFRs for the United States are .That said , as you 've noted even if you exclude people of African immigrant background from the fertility issue you would have a fertility rate of 1.7 , i.e. substantially higher than the European average .( Please provide links and citations demonstrating your claims .Please ? )The traditional family is an ideological construct , and has already been destabilized worldwide by the granting of equal rights to women .Law and , to an increasing degree , society no longer see the nuclear family as one which must be dominated by men .That 's a rather significant shift , do n't you think ?As for fertility , according to OECD data from 2009 the developed countries which exhibit not only the highest fertility rates and the ones showing a tendency to recover include Anglophone countries , the Nordic five , France , and the Benelux states .Leaving the special case of plural Israel aside , Iceland is the OECD country with the highest fertility rate as of 2009 , and there two - thirds of births are to non - married partners .( Only a third of births in Ireland are , which is a somewhat lower rate than Iceland in 1980 . )If anything , in high - income Western countries there seems to be a connection between having a large proportion of children being born to non - married partners and having a high fertility rate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.5499"}

{"text": "In both countries , the TFR decreased drastically until the middle of the seventies and levelled off thereafter .In 1999 , the TFR was 1.8 in France and 1.4 in West Germany .Moreover , pronounced differences in nonmarital births between France and West Germany have emerged since the beginning of the eighties .France witnessed a big increase in non - marital fertility rates ; from roughly 11 % in 1980 they reached 41 % in 1999 .In West Germany , the increase in non - marital births was less pronounced , from 8 % to 18 % ( Council of Europe , 2001 ) .In most developed countries , an increase in non - marital births occurred simultaneously with an increase in non - marital unions ( Kiernan 2001a and b ) .France appears to follow this pattern , but West Germany constitutes an exceptional case .In West Germany , social and policy norms tend to support traditional family structures .The result ?In France , people are childbearing age are split between two sectors , one defined by marriage relationships and the other defined by cohabitation relationships .On the other side of the Rhine , people of childbearing age are split between people who have children and people who do n't .It 's not too much of a surprise , then , that the German Federal Statistics Office reports that of childless women is rising , particularly in the former West Germany .The number of childless women is increasing in Germany .As reported by the Federal Statistical Office ( Destatis ) , in 2008 21 % of the women aged 40 to 44 years had not given birth to a child .By contrast , 16 % of the women who were ten years older ( birth cohorts from 1954 to 1958 ) and only 12 % of the women who were 20 years older ( birth cohorts from 1944 to 1948 ) were childless .A share of 26 % of the women aged between 35 and 39 years had no children yet in 2008 .However , the proportion of childless women will still decline in this age group .These and more 2008 microcensus core results regarding childlessness and births in Germany were announced today by Roderich Egeler , President of the Federal Statistical Office , at a press conference in Berlin .In the eastern part of Germany , the number of childless women is by far smaller than in western Germany .While in the ' old ' L\u00e4nder , 16 % of the women aged 40 to 75 years have no children , their share amounts to only 8 % in the ' new ' L\u00e4nder .Regarding younger women , too , the difference is considerable .Sobotka points out that West German women have evidenced considerably higher rates of childlessness than their French counterparts since the 1940s .Times have changed , and if any number of countries -- Germany included -- are to avoid very prolonged demographic winters they 're going to have to adapt .9 comments : .I 'd be careful about reading too much into differences between East and West Germany , given the size and nature of migration between the two .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.83233"}

{"text": "On how non - traditional families and higher fertility in developed countries go together .One question that multiple commenters raised in my year - end post asking what readers would like to see is the question of what sort of policies and cultural changes would be necessary to boost fertility rates in developed countries .I 'd point these readers to the pragmatism voiced in a recent post at the Global Sociology Blog , \" Let 's Make 2013 The Year We Bury The Concept of ' Traditional Family ' \" .It has never been a cultural and historical reality .It is an ideological construct , like any claimed \" tradition \" .There is no objectivity to it .Family structures are always a product of the intersection between structure , institutions and culture .Just go read Stephanie Coontz 's Family : A History .It 's all there .The boundaries of what makes a family have always been porous and who counts as kin or relative has always involved an ever - changing cast of characters .In other words , rather than corresponding to an objective reality , the invocation of \" traditional family \" obfuscates rather than illuminates .It is a power play , an attempt to reify and solidify a definition of a certain , limited type of family for ideological purposes .It is time to reject the phrase once and for all , along with the political content embedded in it .[ . . . ] .The family , as social institution , is structured at the intersection of a multiplicity of social forces to which it has to adapt .Conversely , it also has some impact on these forces .But this means that \" family \" in an of itself does not exist .In multiplicities of social contexts , one will find multiple family forms , some more patriarchal than others .And this is really what is at stake here : the emergence and greater acceptability of non - patriarchal family forms , from single - mother - headed households to LGBT families ( with or without children ) , to child - free singles ( men and women ) .The invocation of \" traditional family \" is reflects the weaning power of a social control device .Time to finish it off .Aslak , first : .The problem with the traditional family from a demographic perspective is that it often forces the mother to choose between career and children .In very traditional societies , where women do not have the opportunity to pursue careers , this does lead to high fertility rates .But once you give the women the opportunity to pursue careers , the traditional family structure makes them choose , and a lot of them will choose their careers and maybe one child .Indeed , an often - noted trend in the demographic literature is the emergence of a strong correlation between female labor force participation rates and fertility in developed countries .French total fertility rates ( TFR ) have traditionally been higher , on average by the value 0.3 to 0.7 since 1965 ( Council of Europe , 2001 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.772995"}
