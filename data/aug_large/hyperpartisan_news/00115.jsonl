Yousef and United States v. Rahman -- cases that might have greatly expanded our pre-9/11 understanding of al Qaeda had investigators been given a freer hand .The memo is a clear indication that there was pressure then for more intelligence sharing .Ms. Gorelick 's response is an unequivocal \" no \" : .\" We believe that it is prudent to establish a set of instructions that will more clearly separate the counterintelligence investigation from the more limited , but continued , criminal investigations .These procedures , which go beyond what is legally required , will prevent any risk of creating an unwarranted appearance that FISA is being used to avoid procedural safeguards which would apply in a criminal investigation \" ( emphases added ) .In case anyone was in doubt , Janet Reno herself affirmed the policy several months later in a July 19 , 1995 , memo that we have unearthed .In it , the then - Attorney General instructs all U.S. Attorneys about avoiding \" the appearance \" of overlap between intelligence - related activities and law - enforcement operations .Mr. Trie later told investigators that between 1994 and 1996 he raised some $ 1.2 million , much of it from foreign sources , whose identities were hidden by straw donors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.61151"}

Hogan on July 6 , where she remains .The initial criminal investigation began well before the case was turned over to Fitzgerald in December 2003 .It started shortly after conservative columnist Robert Novak first identified Plame as an undercover CIA officer , in a July 14 , 2003 , column .Wilson had only recently led a CIA - sponsored mission to the African nation of Niger to investigate claims that Saddam Hussein was covertly attempting to buy enriched uranium from the African nation to build a nuclear weapon .Wilson reported back to the CIA that the allegations were most likely the result of a hoax .When Wilson sought out White House officials , believing they did not know all the facts , he was rebuffed .He then went public with his criticism of the Bush administration .It was then that senior administration officials began their campaign to discredit Wilson as a means of countering his criticisms of them .Rove and Libby , and to a lesser extent then deputy National Security Council ( NSC ) adviser Stephen J.

Fitzgerald as the special prosecutor who would take over the case .During his initial interview with the FBI , in the fall of 2003 , Rove did not disclose that he had ever discussed Plame with Time magazine correspondent Matthew Cooper , according to two legal sources with firsthand knowledge of the matter .Federal investigators were also skeptical of claims by Rove that he had only first learned of Plame 's employment with the CIA from a journalist , even though he also claimed he could not specifically recall the name of the journalist .As the truthfulness of Rove 's accounts became more of a focus of investigators , career Justice Department employees and senior FBI officials became even more concerned about the continuing role in the investigation of Ashcroft , because of his close relationship with Rove .Rove had earlier served as an adviser to Ashcroft during the course of three political campaigns .The former attorney general had well documented conflicts of interest in this matter , particularly with regard to his personal relationship with Karl Rove .Among other things , Rove was employed by Ashcroft throughout his political career , and Rove reportedly had fiercely advocated for Ashcroft 's appointment as attorney general .Pursuant to standard rules of legal ethics , and explicit rules on conflict of interest , those facts alone should have dictated his immediate recusal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.17204"}

Lewis \" Scooter \" Libby , Strupp writes : .The theory being peddled on the Huffington Post and elsewhere in the lefty blogosphere has Miller not on the receiving end of information from an administration leaker about Plame 's identity , but as the one disseminating information about Plame to administration officials .This is just a theory , of course , with no known evidence supporting it .But it 's fair to say that many Times staffers want Miller 's role in the Plame affair clarified , and some of her Times colleagues are downright angry about what is known , and unknown , about her involvement .And if \" some of her Times colleagues are downright angry about what is known , and unknown , about her involvement , \" as Strupp reports , it is hardly her fault .She has an obligation to protect a confidential source- one that she is keeping- and which quite likely is the only reason that we do not know as much as we would like to otherwise .But simply the fact that there are \" unanswered questions \" should not be cause to condemn a woman who is now spending her 44th night in jail .Those on the left who despise Miller because of her WMD reporting , and want to think the very worst of her are playing right into the hands of those who actually leaked the identity of Valerie Plame , and are now covering up how that occurred .The information had to originally have come from somewhere !The baby Jesus may have been born of immaculate conception .The information leaked to Robert Novak and Matthew Cooper and others that Valerie Plame was employed by the CIA had a more earthly origin .The article disclosed that Ashcroft continued to oversee a probe into the Plame matter even after learning that Karl Rove , who had been a consultant to various Ashcroft political campaigns , was a focus of investigators .Below is a long excerpt from the letter , which will be made public tomorrow : .This investigation would not conflict with the investigation by Special Prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald into the actual leak ; instead , it would focus on Mr. Ashcroft 's failure to recuse himself at the appropriate time in the case .Furthermore , the investigation into the recusal delay would be a logical extension of the request that you also investigate the Department 's failure to comply with proper procedures by not ensuring the preservation of document and other evidence connected with the leak .Early in the Department 's investigation of who had leaked a covert CIA operative 's identity to the media , it became clear that Karl Rove , a senior advisor to the President , was receiving public attention as someone who may have been involved in the crime .We have now learned that , according to law enforcement officials close to the investigation , Mr. Rove failed to disclose to the FBI that he had ever spoken with Time 's Matthew Cooper , a reporter involved in the case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.49042"}

Wilson IV of the leak of his wife 's status as a CIA officer .The administration sources said , however , that they do n't think the investigators are probing the efforts to discredit Wilson and Plame as potential criminal conduct but rather as a way of determining who leaked her identity to conservative columnist Robert Novak .\" I guess their thinking is that if you were involved in efforts to damage their reputations or discredit them since the leak , you might have been the one to have leaked the name , \" said one of the administration officials .The investigators ' motives could not be independently verified , however .And in confirming the expanded scope of the investigation , the two administration officials may simply be engaging in additional damage control by downplaying the potential motives of federal investigators .A broader investigation of actions beyond the original leak would certainly further embarrass the Bush administration .It would also ratchet up pressure by Democrats that a special counsel investigate the leak .The FBI has already interviewed as many as three dozen administration officials and has reviewed phone logs , personal calendars , and e - mail records of a far greater number , according to government officials .Among those questioned have been chief political adviser Karl Rove , White House spokesman Scott McClellan , a number of staffers for Vice President Dick Cheney , and officials at the CIA , State Department , and Pentagon . \" In that this is an ongoing investigation , \" FBI spokesperson Susan Whitson told the Voice on Monday , \" the FBI would not be at liberty to comment .\" The leak to Novak was made while Bush administration officials were attempting to discredit Wilson .The retired diplomat had publicly contended that the Bush administration had been told that one of the tales it used to bolster its case for going to war with Iraq was probably not true .Wilson , congressional Democrats , and even some members of the Bush administration have asserted that the purpose of the leak was not only to discredit Wilson as being a tool of others but also to intimidate other government officials from coming forward to question the rationale for war .In his July 14 column first disclosing Plame 's CIA connection , Novak suggested that she was responsible for her husband 's selection to head a mission to Niger to investigate charges that Saddam Hussein 's regime tried to purchase uranium to build a nuclear weapon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.12164"}
