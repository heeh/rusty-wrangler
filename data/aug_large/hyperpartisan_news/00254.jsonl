{"text": "( Reuters ) - Rolling Stone magazine failed to follow basic journalistic safeguards in publishing a story about an alleged gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity house , according to an outside review of the matter released on Sunday . \"Rolling Stone 's repudiation of the main narrative in ' A Rape on Campus ' is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable , \" the Columbia Journalism Review said in its report , which was conducted at the magazine 's request and published on its website .\" The failure encompassed reporting , editing , editorial supervision and fact - checking .\" Led by Steve Coll , the dean of the Columbia Journalism School , the review examined the editorial process behind the explosive story , which failed to hold up under a barrage of questions raised by other media after its publication in November .But in December , Rolling Stone apologized for \" discrepancies \" in the account and admitted that it never sought comment from seven men accused of the alleged rape .A spokesman for Phi Kappa Psi , the fraternity named in the story , could not be reached immediately for comment .In an editor 's note printed at the top of the CJR report , Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana said the magazine was officially retracting the article and apologized \" to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout .\" It is important that rape victims feel comfortable stepping forward , Dana said , \" and it saddens us to think that their willingness to do so might be diminished by our failings .\" The CJR previously cited the rape article at the top of its list of \" The Worst Journalism of 2014 , \" faulting Erdely for failing to check Jackie 's account against other sources , including her alleged attackers and three friends who were depicted as unsympathetic to her .The analysis said the errors in the story stemmed from the failure of several experienced editors to recognize problems with the reporting of the piece .The reporter and her editors said the story went off the tracks mostly because they were too accommodating to the alleged victim , believing her to be a rape survivor , according to the CJR .But the report said their conclusion was not entirely correct because other mistakes were made throughout the editorial process that , if avoided , may have sent up red flags .Journalists are right to be sensitive to the feelings of rape victims , the report said , but they need to balance that instinct with rigorous verification , which it said was in the best interest of the survivor .\" The story 's blowup comes as another shock to journalism 's credibility amid head - swiveling change in the media industry , \" the report said , adding that the incident highlights the need for newsrooms to reaffirm the best journalistic practices .In particular , the report recommends stronger newsroom policies on the use of pseudonyms , on checking information that casts people in a negative light , and on sharing specific details about a report to allow clearer rebuttals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.793564"}

{"text": "My take .So why did I cover this story in past blog posts , and why am I bringing up the retraction now ?Well , it 's because of the feminist agenda .I want to point out how the feminist left uses stories like this in order to push a wedge between men and women .Women who are indoctrinated for four years in misandry are less likely to look to men as protectors , providers and moral / spiritual leaders .Marriage , with its traditional gender roles of men working and woman raising the kids , will be out .If men are all rapists , then how could a woman give up her own dreams and career to stay home and raise kids ?If men are all rapists , how could a woman trust a man to be faithful to her ?If men are all rapists , then how could a man be trusted to provide for a family .If men are all rapists , then how could a woman trust a man to stick around when she is old and wrinkly ?And of course , this lousy impression of men is all reinforced by the binge - drinking , hooking - up , and serial cohabitation that is so popular in university campuses .There is a reason why Rolling Stone ran with this story , despite all the warning signs - it made the point that they wanted to make .Women who think that they ca n't depend on men will naturally turn to bigger government to provide for them , and that 's what people on the left want women to do .Marriage is subversive to their plan .Having a lot of children is subversive to their plan .Homeschooling is subversive to their plan .It was 1 a.m. on a Saturday when the call came .A friend , a University of Virginia freshman who earlier said she had a date that evening with a handsome junior from her chemistry class , was in hysterics .Something bad had happened .Arriving at her side , three students -\"Randall , \" \" Andy \" and \" Cindy , \" as they were identified in an explosive Rolling Stone account - told The Washington Post that they found their friend in tears .Jackie appeared traumatized , saying her date ended horrifically , with the older student parking his car at his fraternity , asking her to come inside and then forcing her to perform oral sex on five men .In their first interviews about the events of that September 2012 night , the three friends separately told The Post that their recollections of the encounter diverge from how Rolling Stone portrayed the incident in a storyabout Jackie 's alleged gang rape at a U - Va . fraternity .The interviews also provide a richer account of Jackie 's interactions immediately after the alleged attack and suggest that the friends are skeptical of her account .The scene with her friends was pivotal in the article , as it alleged that the friends were callously apathetic about a beaten , bloodied , injured classmate reporting a brutal gang rape at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.68854"}

{"text": "From the teaching establishment to the mainline Protestant denominations , these matters were routinely dealt with through therapy and referral ; internal sanctions existed , but calling the cops was not considered proper ( many in the Orthodox Jewish community still insist on treating these issues internally ) .Similarly , Erdely finds reason to hammer Msgr .Lynn for allowing an accused priest to resign for \" health reasons , \" when , as Erdely correctly says , Msgr .John Gillespie left because of more serious matters .She is right to criticize Lynn , but she leaves the impression that what he did was unconventional .Just recently , New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg lied to the public about the reason why his Deputy Mayor Stephen Goldsmith resigned .The mayor not only drew little flak , he refused to apologize ( Goldsmith did not resign because he did a lousy job policing the effects of a winter snow storm - he quit because he was arrested for beating his wife ) .While it is fair to say that this does n't justify Lynn 's behavior , it is not fair to act as if Lynn were some kind of freak .For example , she refers to a dated study from 1990 by Richard Sipe , an embittered ex - monk , on the subject of celibacy .She refers to Sipe as a psychologist who found that only half of all priests practice celibacy .While no one can say for certain what the real figure is , the truth of the matter is that Sipe does not hold a Ph.D. in psychology ; he is a mental health counselor .On the other hand , she refers to a study published this year on the subject of clergy sex abuse , saying it was funded by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops .She never mentions who conducted the study , namely , professors from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice .Nor does she disclose that the professors have unequivocally said that the bishops had absolutely nothing to do with either its methodology or its findings .Worse , Erdely implies that the bishops were up to something sinister .\"To lower the number of clergy classified as ' pedophiles , ' the report redefines ' puberty ' as beginning at age 10-and then partially blames the rise in child molesting on the counterculture of the 1960s .\" She gets it all wrong .Erdely wants us to believe that puberty begins much later , and that is because her goal - like that of so many of the Church 's critics - is to deflect blame away from those who are , in fact , responsible for most of the molestation , namely homosexuals .As for the role of the counterculture , the John Jay social scientists correctly cited the libertine culture in which the sexual revolution took place .Moreover , the timeline of the abuse scandal , 1965 - 1985 , is indeed a reflection - not a justification - of the collapse of standards .In this regard , New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan got it right when he said that the scandal is over .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.87686"}

{"text": "St. Amant .The plaintiff has the burden of proof on actual malice .The plaintiff also has the burden of proving that the statement was false .Unlike most other civil cases , the burden of proof is not a mere preponderance , but \" clear and convincing \" .No damages will be presumed , but once the plaintiff has carried his burden he can recover actual and punitive damages .Private plaintiff / public issue .Where the plaintiff is not a public official or public figure , but the statement concerns a public issue , the Supreme Court has held that the plaintiff must bear an intermediate burden in order to recover damages for defamation .The states must require that the plaintiff demonstrate some degree of fault on the part of the defendant ( at least negligence , states can require as much more as they care to ) .As in the public / public case , the plaintiff has the burden of proof on the falsity of the statement Hepps and the fault of the defendant .No damages will be presumed .Punitive damages are not available unless the plaintiff can demonstrate actual malice .Private plaintiff / private issue .There are no constitutional requirements ( except perhaps that opinion is not actionable unless the speaker does not in fact have that opinion or there is a false implication of underlying facts ) and the states may make whatever rules they care to .III .Facts that would support a deviation from existing common law rules .Of course , the most important \" facts \" that would support a deviation from common law rules would be any finding that brings this case within the scope of the constitutional requirements set forth by the Supreme Court .In the event that you determine that the constitutional requirements do not apply , the question will be what standards should be applied as a matter of state law .You may conclude that some of the facts of this case justify a change in existing state defamation law .IV .What rules should this state adopt to govern defamation claims ?In considering the options open to this court , it is important to remember that the constitutional standards applied by the United States Supreme Court are minimums , not maximums .The state is free to set its standards higher , it just can not set them any lower .This case probably does not present an occasion to re - examine the basic elements of a defamation claim .We have publication .Whether any or all of the statements were false is one of the fact issues to be resolved .While there may be some dispute on whether the statements were defamatory ( quitter , loser , even pedophile ) , at least the attribution of criminal conduct ( sex with minor ) is defamatory if false .Again , although there may be some debate on whether some of the statements were probably understood as opinion rather than statements of fact , we still have allegedly false statements of fact - slept with teenager , has been sued \" hundreds \" of times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.16957"}
{"text": "Plaintiff must show that defendant acted with improper motive .In ordinary defamation cases , plaintiff can show intent to defame solely through knowledge that the statement was false .In defamation - by - implication cases where the statement can have a non - defamatory meaning , showing falsity alone is inadequate to establish intent to defame .In these cases , plaintiff must show something that establishes defendants ' intent to communicate the defamatory meaning .The Third Circuit apparently breaks down the malice requirement into two elements in defamation by implication cases , separating out a falsity element with a \" communicative intent \" element .To me , that sounds like an unnecessarily confusing way to describe the malice test .After all , if a defendant was aware the defamatory meaning was false , then he necessarily knew the defamatory meaning existed .The test makes more sense if you examine communicative intent first .The court held that a plaintiff can show communicative intent by demonstrating that the defendant either intended to communicate that defamatory meaning or knew of the defamatory meaning and acted in reckless disregard of it .The court found that this approach follows from the Supreme Court 's inclusion of recklessness in the actual malice standard .The Supreme Court has noted that actual malice is a term of art , a shorthand phrase used to describe the First Amendment protections for speech injurious to reputation .The Court has described reckless disregard as the line between protected false communications and unprotected false communications .The Third Circuit found that recklessness is the outer limit of actual malice and that the communicative intent element of actual malice in defamation - by - implication cases can be satisfied by reckless disregard for the defamatory meaning of a statement .Other circuits also support this approach , stating that to find actual malice in defamation - by - implication cases , the plaintiff must show that defendants intended or knew of the implication that the plaintiff attempts to draw from the allegedly defamatory material .The Third Circuit interpreted the phrase \" knew of \" to imply recklessness and used the term \" recklessness \" in its own standard believing that it conforms more closely to the Supreme Court 's definition of actual malice .The court found that recklessness requires that the defendants knew that the defamatory meaning was not just possibly but likely and still made the statement despite the knowledge of that likelihood .Workplace defamation suits will usually raise privilege issues .When one employee complains to a manager or supervisor about another employee and falsely maligns the other employee 's reputation in the process , the court will need to sort out whether the complaint is protected by qualified privilege .If it is , the statement ca n't form the basis for a claim unless it was made with common - law malice or made to persons having no business hearing it .Common - law malice is different than the constitutional \" New York Times \" malice so often discussed in analyzing defamation liability .Common - law malice generally refers to some form of ill will on behalf of the speaker , motivated by things like hatred or a desire for revenge .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.00698"}
