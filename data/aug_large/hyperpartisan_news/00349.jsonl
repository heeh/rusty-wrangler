{"text": "The \" extraordinary circumstances \" surrounding the death of 18-year - old Michael Brown and a request by Brown 's family members prompted the order , Department of Justice spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement .The examination was to take as soon as possible , Fallon said , adding that the Justice Department still planned to take the state - performed autopsy into account in the course of its investigation .As night fell Sunday in Ferguson , another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated after marchers pushed toward one end of a street .Police attempted to push them back by firing tear gas and shouting over a bullhorn that the protest was no longer peaceful .A preliminary private autopsy found that Brown was shot at least six times , including twice in the head .Dr. Michael Baden , a former New York City chief medical examiner , told The New York Times that one of the bullets entered the top of Brown 's skull , suggesting that his head was bent forward when he suffered a fatal injury .Brown was also shot four times in the right arm , and all the bullets were fired into his front , Baden said .The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation into the shooting .A day earlier , officials said 40 FBI agents were going door - to - door gathering information in the Ferguson neighbourhood where Brown , who was unarmed , was shot to death Aug. 9 .A federally conducted autopsy \" more closely focused on entry point of projectiles , defensive wounds and bruises \" might help that investigation , said David Weinstein , a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami 's U.S. attorney 's office .The move is \" not that unusual , \" he added .Federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case , Weinstein said .Back in Ferguson , the latest clashes erupted three hours before the midnight curfew imposed by Gov. Jay Nixon .It was not clear why officers acted ahead of the deadline for people to be off the street .Police in riot gear ordered all the protesters to disperse .Many of the marchers retreated , but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley of tear gas .Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the pavement near the QuikTrip convenience store that was burned down last week .It was an apparent attempt to block police vehicles , but the vehicles easily plowed through .Someone set a nearby trash bin on fire , and gunshots rang out several blocks away .Within two hours , most people had been cleared off West Florissant Avenue , one of the community 's main thoroughfares .Earlier in the day , Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt .Ron Johnson , who agency in now in charge of security in Ferguson , said he had met members of Brown 's family and the experience \" brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.351578"}

Baden , the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York , flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family 's request , the Times said .In an interview , he noted that one of the shots appeared to have struck Brown on the top of his head , but that it was n't immediately clear what that signified .\" It can be because he 's giving up , or because he 's charging forward at the officer , \" Baden said .Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declined Sunday to say when he expects the curfew to end or whether it would be extended further .\" We 'd like to see it ratcheted down , \" Nixon said .\" What we 'd like to see , that will be judged by the community . \"Speaking on CNN , Nixon said he was \" heartened \" by the response to the curfew early Sunday .At a rally Sunday afternoon , the civil rights attorney who represented the family of Trayvon Martin , the unarmed 17-year - old shot to death in Sanford , Fla. , in 2012 ., told a crowd that police are trying to assassinate Brown 's character .On Friday , when police named Officer Darren Wilson as the officer who shot Brown , they also released a surveillance video that appears to show Brown stealing cigars from a convenience store and roughing up the clerk a few minutes before the fatal confrontation .\" They tried it with Trayvon , and now they are trying it with Michael , \" Benjamin Crump said .\" We know that this was an execution . \"He noted that when the officer fired , witnesses say , Brown had his hands raised above his head .\" This means ' Surrender !Do n't shoot !
