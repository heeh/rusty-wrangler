{"text": "So many questions but would be grateful ( and I am sure I 'm not the only one ) for any input .As far as not worming in the old days etc then I just think of my MIL whose mare died of redworm in the days before worming .When using a worm count based programme , a full worming plan or treating a newcomer you need to use a wormer to target encysted redworm .Programmes should have a winter dose specifically for this possibility unless you have several years of good worm count results and the keep is low risk .Encysted redworm are not a different type of worm to the redworm ( strongyle ) eggs found in a worm count .They are simply a normal stage of a redworm 's life .They burrow into the gut wall and do not lay eggs , hence why they wo n't show in a worm count .So your worm counts through the year will help you to know if there are likely to be any redworm to become encysted .If counts are always clear but you have n't had your horse long then they are a possibility .A horse with a poor background and a wormy past is very likely to carry some .Try to avoid your horse taking them into the winter by dosing about end of Nov/ into December .But for normal well looked after horses with good worm count results , do n't worry too much .We recommend the winter dose as a precaution , but if you did n't do it and there were a few worms hibernating there , they would go on and mature to lay eggs at a future point and the worm count would go up .Then you would worm your horse of course .As long as there are not thousands doing a mass exit then there will not be a problem .On the subject of in - foal mares , I was warned off using anything as strong as Equest or Pramox in the run up to foaling and many wormers warn in the small print that they are unsuitable .I usually worm with Panacur granules about two weeks before due date and have never had a problem .It does n't need to be broad spectrum as I thought we only needed to target the worms likely to be passed through mother 's milk ?I wo n't use anything in the immediate run - up to foaling ! !The mares are wormed 8 - 10 weeks before foaling - either with Equest if early foalers - or with Equamax if late foalers .Then they are wormed IMMEDIATELY after foaling with Equest - to make sure they are ' clean ' before going onto rested pasture with their foals - and to clear them of intestinal threadworm - which is passed on to foal in the milk .Equest and Equest Pramox are n't recommended for mares in THIS country because our licensing laws are very tough and it 's just too expensive for manufacturers to comply with the extra tests that would have to be done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.09389"}

{"text": "Obviously - though - you 're ' at your own risk ' if you use them here for broodmares .Ca n't help but think is was the wormer , good job I did n't give it to my 26 year old Arab , he was on separate paddock recovering from what the vet suspected was acorn poisening ! !Has anyone else experienced acorn poisening ?Thank you so much for your quick reply .I am new to this site and still finding my way around , at present trying to remove foal from Brannyman as he is far from being a foal at 27 ! !Yes I am still keeping an eye on my mare and will look for the link on acorn poisening , my vet seemed to think it was more common in cattle .Thank you so much for your quick reply .I am new to this site and still finding my way around , at present trying to remove foal from Brannyman as he is far from being a foal at 27 ! !Yes I am still keeping an eye on my mare and will look for the link on acorn poisening , my vet seemed to think it was more common in cattle .there is a thread on here somewhere re acorns but this very sad thread is on another forum .Please read it if you can , they are a killer .I am terrified of this wormer !Actually I am wary of any worer now , but in particular Promax .I wormed my mare with it last year and got a tiny bit on my lip when she threw her head in the air .I was soooo poorly !I ended up in hospital on a drip .Unfortunately the hospital were not certain it was the wormer as I had ingested so little of it and so put it down to gatric flu .I am 100 % certain it was the wormer as I took ill within a couple of hours of getting it in my mouth .I lost 6lbs in weight !My horse was also a bit ' off ' for a day or two .No particular symptoms just not herself .I wo n't use it again .I am sure any wormer could do the same if you swallowed ( or in my case wiped it near your mouth ) but Promax is apparently a much more potent womer .I am so sorry that you lost your horse and yes there is a chance it was coincidence .We all take the risk of our horses colicking every time we worm them though .We are only doing what we feel is in their best interest so please do n't beat yourself up .Your horse knew you loved him and would never deliberatly do anything to endager him .Just a dreadful tragedy !I thought I would add some info here .I purchased a horse at the beginning fo the year and her worming history was a tad dubious so I decided to worm with Equest Pramox .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.835655"}
