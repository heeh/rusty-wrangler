{"text": "Experts say white supremacist groups are on the rise , fueled by a bad economy and the election of a black president .By Ron Scherer , Staff Writer , Kevin Loria , Contributor / August 6 , 2012 .The deadly shooting at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee is renewing concern about the white supremacist movement in the United States , which experts say is on the rise in large part because of the weak economy and a visceral distrust among some people of the first African - American president .Wade Michael Page , who gunned down six people Sunday before being shot and killed by police , was a member of a hardcore rock band that was part of underground movement featuring racist ideologies and he had coded racist tattoos .Police have not released any details as to Mr. Page 's motivations .Despite the increase in the number of hate groups , however , it is relatively rare for their vitriol to result in actual violence , experts say .Instead , their invective shows up on website chat rooms and in social media like Facebook and Twitter , using relatively obscure names oftentimes related to Adolf Hitler .White supremacist members , often with shaved heads and tattoos extolling the Nazi cause , meet periodically at barbeques and concerts that receive little advance publicity .Their music is often filled with lyrics that appeal to alienated individuals .High unemployment caused by the lingering economic recession often fuels resentment , causing groups to lash out at immigrants or others often competing for low - wage jobs .The Sept. 11 , 2011 terrorist attacks caused a backlash against Muslims , and attacks have been reported on Sikhs by people confusing them with Muslims .At the same time that hate groups appear to be on the rise , hate crimes have fallen to a 14-year low , Mr. Levin says .Hate crime homicides are relatively rare .\" The last ten years we 've averaged under a dozen a year , \" Levin says .\" But most years it 's in single digits .\" When they do take place , the odds are good a white supremacist was involved .According to Mark Pitcavage , director of investigative research at the Anti - Defamation League , 85 percent of all extremist - related murders are committed by white supremacists .The most violent group , according to Pitcavage , is the Texas Aryan Brotherhood , which the ADL says has committed at least 29 murders .Even when group members are arrested , they continue operating in prison , Pitcavage says .According to the Houston Chronicle , a four - year statewide investigation by law enforcement into the group resulted in the prosecution of 34 members for murder and racketeering .Another 30 ended up in state prisons .According to Pitcavage , gaining membership in a hate group such as Hammerskins requires a trial period for other members to assess a prospective member .In the case of Page , he appears to have joined the group early in 2011 and became a full - fledged member by late 2011 , Pitcavage says .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.061806"}

{"text": "Electrons seemed to be moving as units , or quanta , consistent with their single negative charge .Klitzing won the 1985 Nobel in Physics for demonstrating this integer quantum Hall effect .But when Stormer and Tsui further refined the experiment , they got a surprising result .They used a novel semiconductor material -- now used in cell phones -- to trap electrons in a two - dimensional space chilled to near absolute zero .Ramping up the magnetic field now produced not integer steps in potential , but fractional steps , as if the electrons had split apart .A year later , theoretical physicist Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University explained Stormer and Tsui 's strange results .He hypothesized that the electrons had condensed into a sort of fluid , with groups of electrons functioning as \" quasiparticles , \" each exhibiting a fractional charge .Stormer , Tsui , and Laughlin shared the Nobel .News coverage the day of the announcement tended to quote the Nobel Committee 's citation , while later stories attempted with varying results to explain the work .Stormer says Malcolm W. Browne 's lengthy article in the New York Times explained the science well , but the experimentalist took exception to the headline \" 5 Quantum Theorists Share 2 Nobel Prizes in Sciences . \"\" We all were called theorists .That I was actually astonished about .\" Writers rarely come up w ith the headlines , but the headline often creates a crucial first impression .Other writers , however , did n't get the science right .Adam Miller and Angela C. Allen , writing in the New York Post , stumbled in the lead paragraph with : \" ... new particles generated when electrons are subjected to low temperatures and high magnetic fields . \"And Virginia Breen , writing in the New York Daily News , wrote \" Stormer 's winning discovery found that big electrons , when thrown together , can form smaller units . \" Many writers tried too hard to lend a practical bent to the story .Scientists think about practical uses , but understand how long the lab - to - product transition can take .Wolfgang Ketterle , John D. MacArthur professor of physics at MIT , says of the Nobel - winning discovery : \" This is fundamental work , and it 's a long haul from such fundamental work to applications . \"K.C. Cole , writing in the L.A. Times , stepped over the line , Stormer says .She wrote that the Nobel - winning findings were \" applicable to everyday objects and events . \"\" That is quite a stretch , actually , \" Stormer insists .\" I have pointed out repeatedly that I do not see an application of the fraction quantum Hall effect for quite a while , if ever . \"Norman Christ , professor and chairman of Columbia 's physics department , also emphasizes the importance of basic research .\" I think all scientists , certainly physicists , at the moment are enormously sensitive that what we 're doing be seen as for the greater public good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.84871"}
