Tom Coburn ( R ) today introduced an amendment to the Marketplace Fairness Act that would end the practice of allowing professional sports leagues to qualify as tax - exempt organizations .\" The Oakland Raiders would be affected by Senator Coburn 's amendment .( photo : USA Today Sports ) .The NFL Is a Tax - Exempt Organization - But One Senator Wants to Change That .Since 1966 , the tax code has allowed leagues to classify as 501(c)(6 ) charitable organizations - a classification used by trade and industry organizations - under the assumption that the leagues were promoting the general value of their sports .The NFL , for instance , did n't seem interested in promoting the general spread of football when a competitor league , the United States Football League , was formed in 1983 .Likewise , the PGA Tour , NHL , and other sports leagues serve to promote their brand of their sports , not the sport as a whole .Further , the leagues hardly pay their executives as if they are non - profits .The NFL paid $ 51.5 million to just eight executives in 2010 , according to Coburn , and other leagues are similar - PGA commissioner Tim Finchem made $ 5.2 million that year , while NHL commissioner Gary Bettman took home $ 4.3 million .In his 2012 Waste Book that chronicled government waste , Coburn said that taxpayers were losing as much as $ 91 million a year subsidizing professional sports leagues because of their non - profit status : .The National Football League ( NFL ) , the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , and the Professional Golfers ' Association ( PGA ) classify themselves as non - profit organizations to exempt themselves from federal income taxes on earnings .Smaller sports leagues , such as the National Lacrosse League , are also using the tax status .Taxpayers may be losing at least $ 91 million subsidizing these tax loopholes for professional sports leagues that generate billions of dollars annually in profits .Taxpayers should not be asked to subsidize sports organizations already benefiting widely from willing fans and turning a profit , while claiming to be non - profit organizations .That would seem a hard standard for most professional leagues to meet , given the amount of revenue they make and the benefits they provide to the people involved .Individual team owners , in fact , benefit substantially from the league 's structure and even its classification as a non - profit organization .NFL teams pay membership dues totaling roughly $ 6 million per team , but they are allowed to write those off for tax purposes as donations to a charitable organization .The NFL 's dues , then , go almost solely toward the enrichment of its franchise owners even as they are exempt from federal taxation ( and often from state and local taxation as well ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.03538"}

Tom Coburn ( R ) today introduced an amendment to the Marketplace Fairness Act that would end the practice of allowing professional sports leagues to qualify as tax - exempt organizations .\" The Oakland Raiders would be affected by Senator Coburn 's amendment .( photo : USA Today Sports ) .The NFL Is a Tax - Exempt Organization - But One Senator Wants to Change That .Since 1966 , the tax code has allowed leagues to classify as 501(c)(6 ) charitable organizations - a classification used by trade and industry organizations - under the assumption that the leagues were promoting the general value of their sports .The NFL , for instance , did n't seem interested in promoting the general spread of football when a competitor league , the United States Football League , was formed in 1983 .Likewise , the PGA Tour , NHL , and other sports leagues serve to promote their brand of their sports , not the sport as a whole .Further , the leagues hardly pay their executives as if they are non - profits .The NFL paid $ 51.5 million to just eight executives in 2010 , according to Coburn , and other leagues are similar - PGA commissioner Tim Finchem made $ 5.2 million that year , while NHL commissioner Gary Bettman took home $ 4.3 million .In his 2012 Waste Book that chronicled government waste , Coburn said that taxpayers were losing as much as $ 91 million a year subsidizing professional sports leagues because of their non - profit status : .The National Football League ( NFL ) , the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , and the Professional Golfers ' Association ( PGA ) classify themselves as non - profit organizations to exempt themselves from federal income taxes on earnings .Smaller sports leagues , such as the National Lacrosse League , are also using the tax status .Taxpayers may be losing at least $ 91 million subsidizing these tax loopholes for professional sports leagues that generate billions of dollars annually in profits .Taxpayers should not be asked to subsidize sports organizations already benefiting widely from willing fans and turning a profit , while claiming to be non - profit organizations .That would seem a hard standard for most professional leagues to meet , given the amount of revenue they make and the benefits they provide to the people involved .Individual team owners , in fact , benefit substantially from the league 's structure and even its classification as a non - profit organization .NFL teams pay membership dues totaling roughly $ 6 million per team , but they are allowed to write those off for tax purposes as donations to a charitable organization .The NFL 's dues , then , go almost solely toward the enrichment of its franchise owners even as they are exempt from federal taxation ( and often from state and local taxation as well ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.41591"}

Walter Duncan , who took on former New England Patriots coach Chuck Fairbanks as a minority partner .Fairbanks also served as general manager and head coach .The team made a big splash by signing Heisman Trophy -winning underclassman Herschel Walker , a running back from the University of Georgia .While the USFL had followed the NFL 's lead in banning underclassmen from playing , league officials were certain that this rule would never withstand a court challenge .In an even more ominous development , Walker did not sign a standard player contract .Rather , he agreed to a three - year personal - services contract with Duncan .The contract was valued at $ 4.2 million - more than double the USFL 's salary cap of $ 1.8 million .Nonetheless , the other owners knew having the incumbent Heisman winner in their fold would lend the USFL instant credibility , and allowed the contract to stand .Eventually , nearly all of the other teams jettisoned league founder David Dixon 's original blueprint and began signing star players to expensive contracts - a step which ultimately proved to be the league 's undoing .Despite the signing of Walker , who rushed for 1,812 yards and 17 touchdowns , the Generals finished their inaugural season with a 6 - 12 record .This was largely due to a porous defense which gave up the third - most points in the league ( 437 ) .The 1985 season saw the heralded signing of Heisman Trophy - winning quarterback Doug Flutie of Boston College .Despite Flutie 's inexperience , the Generals traded Sipe to the Jacksonville Bulls to ensure Flutie would start .Flutie struggled at times but played well overall until he suffered a broken collarbone against the Memphis Showboats in the season 's 15th game and did not play again .The 1985 Generals finished 11 - 7 behind Walker 's pro football - record 2,411 rushing yards but lost again to the Stars ( transplanted to Baltimore ) in the first round of the playoffs , 20 - 17 .The USFL planned to play its 1986 schedule in the fall , directly opposite the NFL , thanks mostly to Trump 's strong advocacy of direct competition with the older , established league .Two years earlier , Trump sold most of his fellow owners on a move to the fall by arguing that it would eventually force a merger with the NFL - in which the owners of any USFL teams included in a merger would see their investment more than double .The Generals merged with the Houston Gamblers during the extended offseason , adding such stars as quarterback Jim Kelly and wide receiver Ricky Sanders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.89714"}

Tom Coburn , R - Okla . , claims it 's worth as much as $ 91 million annually .Mr. Coburn , a polished practitioner when it comes to identifying federal waste , is sponsoring the Properly Reducing Overexemptions for Sports Act , which would deprive sports leagues with annual revenue of more than $ 10 million of their tax - exempt status .Other ventures that enjoy the privilege include the PGA Tour and the National Hockey League .Thus far , the crusading Mr. Coburn has persuaded only one of his colleagues to cosponsor his proposal , Sen. Angus King , I - Maine .Mr. King stepped forward last week , as did U.S. Rep.

NFL - via random selection among all the federal judges in the Minnesota district .In Powell , Doty , who had been a labor lawyer on the management side during his years with the now - defunct Popham , Haik , Schnobrich , Kaufman & Doty law firm , ruled the league owners had violated antitrust laws .( By the way , the lawyer for the owners during those days was a Washington , D.C. , attorney named Paul Tagliabue , who would go on to become the NFL commissioner . )That so - called \" White settlement \" was formalized by a consent decree by Doty , and , with it , the judge retained jurisdiction over all labor matters for as long as the White settlement is in place .It is , in fact , still in place .That 's why Doty , who was once a Gophers football player ( for a few weeks ) , still oversees all these NFL disputes .That 's why some lawyers suspect this ongoing collective bargaining battle could also wind up back in Doty 's court .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.69557"}
