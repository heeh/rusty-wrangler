Edwards and his supporters appear to be deeply unhappy about - a record that makes VoxPopuli believe that the Clintons are like the Bushes - is this : .More than 22 million jobs were created in less than eight years -- the most ever under a single administration , and more than were created in the previous twelve years .Which brings us to what this post is really about - the \" Clinton dynasty \" .I 'll let the website Hillaryis44 ( run by self - described Hillary supporters ) address this , from earlier this year - and I hope they do n't mind my reprinting a big portion of their post on this : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.077995"}

Wright 's comments .In a statement supposedly issued to address the matter , Obama ignored the point that his minister and friend had spoken adoringly of Farrakhan and that Wright 's church was behind the award to the Nation of Islam leader .Instead , as outlined in a Jan. 17 Newsmax article , he disingenuously claimed he thought the magazine bestowed the award on Farrakhan for his efforts to rehabilitate ex - prisoners .Neither Wright 's encomiums about Farrakhan nor the Trumpet article mentions ex - prisoners .He then proceeded to rewrite her comments , claiming that she had meant she was encouraged by the \" large numbers of people \" who have gotten involved in the political process .Michelle Obama then made a similar revision of her remarks .In her speech in Milwaukee , Michelle Obama said flatly , \" For the first time in my adult lifetime , I am really proud of my country , and not just because Barack has done well , but because I think people are hungry for change . \"And what has been wrong with America up to now ?That it gave Michelle the opportunity to attend Princeton and Harvard Law School ?That it gave Barack Obama the chance to attend Columbia University and Harvard Law School and become a U.S. senator making more than $ 1 million a year from book royalties ?Was it that America stopped Nazi Germany from continuing to murder millions of Jews ?That America has provided Africa and other countries with $ 15 billion to combat the spread of AIDS / HIV and that another $ 30 billion is on the way ?That 46 percent of all Americans classified by the Census Bureau as poor own their own homes , 76 percent of them have air conditioning , and 75 percent of them have at least one car ?Or that America allows us to express our views freely without fear of being put in jail , as is the case in Russia ?A lawyer , Michelle Obama is perfectly capable of expressing herself precisely .In fact , she spoke from a written speech .Those who do not want to believe she meant what she said - and that Barack Obama could not be so close to Rev.

Lee first remarked about his election to the U.S. Senate in 2010 , after beating incumbent Republican Bob Bennett at the state party convention .Then , he went into rather humorous anecdotes about how security did n't recognize him as a senator for the longest time during his first session in Congress .However , he looked forward to two events this year that he thought would transform government , and make it more palatable to the Founder 's vision .The first event was on June 28 , the day of the Obamacare decision , which he received - along with most conservatives - warmly at first .The court was articulating a position defining limits on the Commerce Clause - making this the third time in the last seventy - five years where the Supreme Court has done so .However , as the reading of the opinion continued , more wind was blowing in liberal sails , as the senator described it .The Court rewrote the law .To make a long story short , the penalty was constitutional under the taxing authority , which was a position that was n't argued by the government .In all , it was a limited purpose victory .The second event was on November 6 , which we know did not turn out well for conservatives .Sen. Lee agreed that we won the argument for a limited proposal victory , but we also lost a lot too .It showed that the Court can rewrite laws , and we lost the opportunity to write laws of our own choosing .The checks on Congressional power was stipulated by judiciary and political restraint .The judicial restraint has been compromised .They seem , as Senator Lee put it , \" unwilling \" to exercise that check on power .Second , the political check is rendered useless since Congress can pass unconstitutional laws , but if the Supreme Court can rewrite it - then what 's the purpose of that check on government power .Sen. Lee believes that the Court acted in a manner where everyone got a little of what they wanted - but ended up hurting the American people as a result .Nevertheless , he feels that America 's best days are ahead .Senator - Elect Ted Cruz also reiterated anecdotes on the campaign trail .His win is almost a miracle .He was polling sub 5 % , and within the margin of error when he first began .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.325"}

' , pointing out the absurdity of the question .Burnett also suggests in this interview that ' two people died ' at Geller 's drawing Muhammad competition , as if to suggest they were bystanders who were victims of Geller 's hate or something , never mentioning that it was the terrorists themselves who died .Of course Geller corrected her .In a discussion on the August 4 edition of CNN Newsroom , Hill attacked Israel 's Iron Dome system , seemingly lamenting the fact that it has limited Israeli deaths , leading to the disproportionate outcome of the war liberals so often mention .He absurdly claimed : .But what the Iron Dome does is it also takes away all of Hamas 's military leverage which is very different than say , 10 years ago or 15 years in other wars like Lebanon , et cetera .As a result , it serves a defensive purpose but de facto serves an offensive purpose .It allows Israel to essentially assault and siege Gaza without any retribution or response on the other side .So again , to some extent , they are not just funding defense , they are funding an offensive war and ultimately an occupation .That for me , is the problem .In short , it seems Hill objects to U.S. taxpayer funding of Iron Dome because it \" serves an offensive purpose \" by limiting the ability of the Islamist terror network Hamas to slaughter Israeli citizens in \" retribution .\" Hill misses the point about military conflicts : the ultimate goal is to win and at the same time limit civilian casualties on your own side .Hill is a classic example of someone who is educated beyond their hat size .The man has no common sense , no wisdom , he has nothing but a perverse desire for \" equality \" .In this case it is , apparently , an equality of casualties .What has Clarence Thomas done to outrage the Left so ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.78771"}

{"text": "Supreme CourtJustice Clarence Thomas can add another insult to the list of things \" liberal elites \" have attacked him for : his marriage to a white woman .Holmes denied saying such a thing about Thomas , who he then called an \" Uncle Tom \" .Man what tolerance huh ?But that was just the tip of the Iceberg of liberal Bigotry .Thomas REALLY got the Left into full blown nut job mode when he dared to share some memories of Georgia in the 1960 's .He said race \" rarely \" came up when he became the first black child to go to a white school in Savannah , Georgia .Nowadays , however , you ca n't escape people being overly sensitive about race and sex , Thomas said , and revealed that he was treated much worse Northern liberals than by anyone in the South .\" The worst I have been treated was by northern liberal elites .The absolute worst I have ever been treated , \" Thomas said .\" The worst things that have been done to me , the worst things that have been said about me , by northern liberal elites , not by the people of Savannah , Georgia .\" Whoa !Who does Thomas think he is ?He is not allowed to challenge the Left 's narrative on race !He can not tell people what HIS personal experiences were .No !He must parrot the Left 's narrative that the South was RAAAAACIST !And lynchings were an everyday event , and the South , of course , was , and is a land of evil bigots that hate all minorities .Of course , to his credit , Thomas likely gives not the first damn about the Liberal 's version of American history .He experienced what he experienced , and he shared some of that .And for that , he is being raked over the coals by who else , some of the same Liberal elites that demand Blacks walk , talk , and think in lockstep with Leftist ideology , or else !The guests on CNN on Wednesday excoriated Thomas for his lack of racial consciousness , and particularly his lament that the country is more conscious of racial difference than it was , in his opinion , 50 years ago .\" What 's so remarkable about this statement that it neglects the fact that in the mid-60s , when he was a kid , you could get killed if you were a black person for speaking about race , \" CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin asserted .Excuse me Mr. Toobin , but Thomas spoke about HIS experience .He did not \" neglect \" any facts .The problem here is that Toobin expects anyone who talks about the South in the 50 's or 60 's to follow the Leftist script that Toobin obviously follows .By the way , my mother , who grew up in the South , in the 50 's and 60 's has told me things that are similar to what Thomas said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.35114"}

Daley .A few weeks ago I was watching a program on C - Span pertaining to the impact of foreign court opinions upon the U.S. justice system .The primary participants in the discussion were Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer , and the event took place at the American University Law School in Washington D.C. rtsp://video.c - span .org / archive / sc / sc011305_scalia .rm .The debate revolved around questions asked by a moderator named Professor Norman Dorsen , and the first multi - part question asked was , \" When we talk about the use of foreign court decisions in U.S. Constitutional cases , what body of foreign law are we talking about ?Are we limiting this to foreign constitutional law ?What about cases involving international law , such as the interpretation of treaties , including treaties to which the U.S. is a party ?When we talk about the use of foreign court decisions in U.S. law , do we mean them to be authority , or persuasive , or rhetorical ?If , for example , foreign court decisions are not understood to be precedent in U.S. Constitutional cases , are they nevertheless able to strengthen the sense that U.S. law assures a common moral and legal framework with the rest of the world ?If this is so , is that in order to strengthen the legitimacy of a decision within the U.S. , or to strengthen a decision 's legitimacy in the rest of the world ? \" Some question , huh ?I do n't think I 'd be comfortable trying to answer it all in one fell swoop , and apparently neither did the two justices .Justice Scalia began his reply by stating that most of the parts of it should be posed to Justice Breyer , simply because Scalia does not use foreign law in the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution .He stated that he will use it when interpreting a treaty , because treaties are based upon a mutual understanding of the law by the signatories thereof .That seemed like a no - brainer to me , and the point was not argued by Breyer .Scalia went on to say that , aside from that , he refuses to use foreign decisions in Constitutional law .He argued that some justices refer to foreign law because they want to feel assured that we have the same \" moral and legal framework as the rest of the world . \"He then pointed out , quite matter - of - factly , that we do n't have the same moral and legal framework , and we never have .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.319534"}
