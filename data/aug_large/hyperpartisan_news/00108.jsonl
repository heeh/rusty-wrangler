Bob Etheridge .With 93 counties reporting , Dalton was leading Etheridge 46 percent to 38 percent , with state Rep.

Orange Street .General Assembly Weekend Check - In .Three major , and controversial , decisions have been made in the North Carolina General Assembly this past weekend : the Senate 's new spending plan , teacher pay raises , and the fracking bill .The Senate has decided upon a new $ 21.1 billion spending plan for 2014 - 15 this weekend .Democrats were displeased with how quickly the decision was made , as it allowed for minimal negotiation .They seemed to be in consensus that the Senate was only interested in hearing their own approval , rather than the perspectives of the general public .As part of this new budget plan , legislators also desire to encourage teachers to give up their tenure in exchange for an 11 % raise in pay .Teachers , in response , are disagreeing with the motion as they desire more protection from unfriendly politics that surround schools presently .These raises are also planned to be gathered from cuts that would come from public school spending .Other states are allegedly not attempting this swap of pay raise for tenure .Democrats agree that this action is not for the benefit of the teacher 's , but more of a cover - up for legislators ' inability to manage money wisely .The fracking bill , completely supported by the House Republicans , is now on its way to be signed by Gov. Pat McCrory , who is more than ready to help get it passed .While Democrats were clearly unhappy with the bill , they failed to halt the process .Instead , they were able to add a few minor alterations to the bill as compromise before being sent to Gov. McCrory .Many North Carolinians fear what the fracking might mean for chemicals that could get into well water , as well as how the Senate now seems to have the ability to override local governments in relation to how the fracking will be carried out .As of now , there seems to be a great deal of controversy with each major decision processed by the General Assembly of North Carolina this past weekend .The uncertainty regarding the decided amount of the budget has some questioning how things are going to get better now .The risky move of raising teachers ' salaries whilst eliminating assistants and tenure is causing a rift of displeasure from educators of North Carolina , and unfavorable fracking plans that may affect local businesses in a way that they are unwilling to comply with the Senate 's decision .Local Electeds React To State Senate Budget .The North Carolina General Assembly is meeting in \" short session \" this year - but there 's been no shortness of controversy .Already facing a multi - million - dollar shortfall , officials at Chapel Hill - Carrboro City Schools say the Senate 's proposal would likely force the district to make even more cuts than they were initially planning - unless they can persuade County Commissioners to dig even deeper into the pool of local money .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.710403"}

Dr. William J. Barber II on July 4 , 2013 On Last Week 's Attacks by the Civitas Institute .Pastor , Greenleaf Christian Church ( DOC ) , Goldsboro , NC .President , N.C. Conference of NAACP Branches .Chair of the Board , Rebuilding Broken Places , Inc. .Let me talk about the context of the attacks and then refute them with the facts .On July 1 , 2013 , North Carolina became the first state in the nation to cut unemployment insurance payments to 170,000 down - on - their - luck job seekers .Unemployment insurance is a lifeline that can be the difference between eating and starving , shelter and homelessness , hope and despair .The current leadership of the General Assembly and the Governor cut this lifeline , knowing that extending the benefits would have been of zero cost to North Carolina and would have helped save tens of thousands of families from financial ruin .The N.C. Budget Director , Mr. Art Pope , who is responsible for advising the government in making these moral budget decisions did not say a word about this act of cold disdain toward our neighbors looking for work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.63206"}

McCrory signed the bill Tuesday along with four others .He said the Common Core bill does not officially repeal the federal standards but will review and improve them .North Carolina is now one of five states that have changed or removed the Common Core standards from schools and are creating new state - specific ones .The law directs the State Board of Education to rewrite the Common Core standards for the North Carolina 's K-12 schools .A new 11-member standards advisory commission will be formed to make curriculum recommendations to the board .Common Core , which schools began testing two years ago , would remain in place until the new standards are completed .McCrory Threatens Senate Budget Veto .RALEIGH - Gov. Pat McCrory says he 'd veto any North Carolina budget plan on his desk that raises teacher pay dramatically like the Senate wants because it would mean huge cuts elsewhere to pay for it .McCrory told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday he 's not going to risk key government services and allow Medicaid reductions to accept the Senate 's average 11 percent pay offer .The original Senate proposal cut funding for thousands of teacher assistants to pay for it .Senate Leader Phil Berger ( R - Rockingham ) issued the following statement Thursday : .The governor has been unable to sustain any of his previous vetoes in the Senate .The governor is siding with the latest House offer to raises teacher pay on average by 6 percent , up from 5 percent .He says 6 percent is about as far as he can go and feel comfortable .The two chambers are negotiating budget adjustment for the year that started July 1 .On School Funding , BOCC Faces Tough Choices .Tonight at 7:00 , the Orange County Board of Commissioners holds a work session ( at the Southern Human Services Center ) to continue discussing next year 's fiscal budget - including , perhaps most notably , the question of funding for Orange County 's two school districts .The current proposal ( with no property tax increase ) includes a $ 2.9 million combined increase in spending for Orange County Schools and Chapel Hill - Carrboro City Schools - but the two districts face a combined shortfall of around $ 7 million .Local officials are also watching the budget debate in Raleigh , where legislators are considering at least one proposal that would eliminate funding for teaching assistants in grades 2 and 3 ( among other things ) .Hillsborough Mayor Talks Town Budget , Town Future .At its meeting on Monday , June 9 , the Hillsborough Board of Commissioners is scheduled to vote on the proposed budget for fiscal year 2015 .The proposed budget includes no property tax or water rate increase , but does include an 8.8 percent increase in sewer rates to help pay for the $ 19.8 million upgrade to the town 's wastewater treatment plant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.164764"}
{"text": "But of particular note to us in Orange County is the aptly - numbered Senate Bill 666 .The most significant change in SB 666 is n't in chapter 163 which governs elections ; rather , it 's a change to the tax code : .Personal Exemption . -In calculating North Carolina taxable income , a taxpayer may deduct an exemption amount equal to the amount listed in the table below based on the taxpayer 's filing status and adjusted gross income .The taxpayer is allowed the same personal exemptions allowed under section 151(b ) of the Code for the taxable year .In other words , parents living in North Carolina whose son or daughter registers to vote in the city where they go to college may not claim them as a dependent .Should it pass , SB 666 would prevent literally thousands of young voters in Chapel Hill and Carrboro from participating in local elections in the cities where they actually reside , and would erode decades of work to enfranchise local college students .A petition is out there for you to sign , but I suspect our local representatives are already on the right side of this one .Also of note to local elections , our Orange County Board of Elections , which has seen a Democratic majority for all of recent memory , is about to flip to a Republican majority as a side effect of Governor McCrory 's election last fall .The county boards of elections are appointed by the NC State Board of Elections , which is itself appointed by the governor .Though by statute they must contain representatives of both parties , this change is likely to bring new challenges to our efforts to make voting easier for students and disadvantaged communities locally .Comments .Thanks so much for the thorough post , Jason .As a recently - graduated student who attended UNC for four years , this is is ridiculous .Yes , I registered in 2008 to vote in Orange County for several reasons , including for local elections , better accessibility and I enjoyed voting with my friends together at Morehead Planetarium .The NCGOP is out to completely remove all of the out - of - state students from the political conversation , many of which go on to stay here and live in NC after graduation .It 's a despicable law , along with the many others , but on this one , I think there may be some lemonade .From the last election , we know that young voters are more liberal than the current state house denizens .So if more of them vote in their home counties / districts , rather than here in Orange County , they might actually be able to bring sanity back to state government .Their votes here in Orange County just pile on those of the permanent residents .Was n't it you , Jason , who always went home to vote for this very reason ?If every student who voted here ended up voting at home , I do n't think it would be such an issue at the state level ( though it would be a big shift locally ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.234955"}

{"text": "Irving had ample warning that his actions were in violation of the law .Not only was the law itself well known , but he had been restricted from entering the country because of it .He knowingly violated the laws of his host nation , and he is being punished for it .For the record , the guy is a moron .He 's also a liar ; he 's probably lying now .The CBC , Canada 's state radio , interviewed Deborah Lipstadt a few days back and one of the things she mentioned is that his change of mind was n't evident at her libel trial , which occurred after 1991 .( For the record , she 's for his freedom of speach as well ) .She also pointed out what John H did ; Irving went to Austria with knowledge of their laws .To the list of Irving 's attributes we can probably add \" weenie \" as well .Not only did he abandon his principles ( hah ) in an attempt to escape punishment he could have easily avoided in the first place , now that he 's in jail he 's trying to regain the regard of the losers whose views he just spurned .He 's going to be writing a book , just like Hitler did .( Is it just allied propaganda , or was Hitler a bit of a weenie too ? )It 's probably going to work .Kevin Q , we do n't disagree .You have to know the laws of the countries you are visiting and if you violate them you have to bear the cost .I agree he violated Austrian law and that he should have known better ; I also happen to think Austria should not have a law that inhibits free speech .One may believe both things simultaneously .But John , what of the right of a free people to decide for themselves what they will and will not tolerate in their society ?The US has decided that all speech is to be tolerated , yet as has been mentioned above , there are limits .Would we vote to do the same thing if there were something like the Holocaust we were equally ashamed of ?I 'm not saying I agree with Austria 's laws regarding the Holocaust , but I do support their right to democratically make & enforce such laws .Freedom of speech does not include the freedom to shout ' fire ' in a crowded theatre .Austria and Germany suffered terribly , within living memory , under the Nazi lash , and it is entirely understandable that they would view holocaust denial as tantamount to yelling ' fire ' .That said , I personally believe that the best cure for hate speech is more speech : the vile lies of the revisionists wither fastest in the clear light of truth .But I understand why Germany and Austria are wary .Hell , look how the US reacted to 3000 deaths .Germany and Austria lost millions ( and killed millions , I do n't know which would be worse ) and were divided and occupied for years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "129.40137"}
