{"text": "The main point , the obvious difference between their \" populism \" and Krauthammer 's ideology is that he blames systems for the nation 's problems , while the populists , true to their name , blame people .Populism , I 'd guess , is less concerned with the right ideas holding sway than with the right people doing so , whether they 're defined individually or demographically .For such people , structural change matters less as an end unto itself than the character of the change - maker .Senator Cruz also benefits from this to an extent , as the open contempt his fellow Republican Senators show for him signals to the grass roots that Cruz may have the personal qualities necessary to make change when ideological qualifications have n't sufficed .While Krauthammer might believe that a change of mind might redeem old politicians who sign on with \" reform conservatism , \" populists probably feel that past failures -- as in failing the American people -- disqualify politicians from ever reclaiming public trust .That 's how many Sanders supporters feel about Hillary Clinton , I suspect , and many of them probably wo n't vote for her if she gets the nomination unless they get really , really scared of the Republican nominee .Ditto for Trump supporters if their man loses , unless their hate for Clinton is as really , really strong .In any event , some sort of populism -- some sort of politics that calls on leaders \" like us \" to stand up for people \" like us \" -- probably rises inevitably from the bankruptcy of ideology .T he current Harper 's has a scathing article by Garret Keizer on a relic of oldschool leftism , the Revolutionary Communist Party USA , led from French exile by Bob Avakian .There might have been a point to the attack , which Keizer , showing his own hand somewhat , describes as \" nasty bits of Eurocentric arrogance , \" were Avakian not the object of a carefully cultivated , utterly obscure cult of personality .Avakian is a Marxist - Leninist on the Maoist model , the RCP 's line being that the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s , a period the Chinese themselves prefer to pass over with a silent shudder , was \" the furthest advance of human emancipation \" to date .Interestingly , Avakian fled the U.S. after leading a protest against the 1979 visit of Deng Xiaoping , the man who made China 's superpower possible but whom hard - core Maoists regard as a treacherous capitalist - roader .Avakian takes the position that no real revolution is possible without a correct , scientifically determined \" line \" as synthesized by himself .All of this makes me wonder why the organizers of the Revolution and Religion dialogue thought it was worth having Avakian in their midst .Cornel West at least has some sort of celebrity , while Avakian seems only to have a cult .Perhaps the organizers were entranced by the \" Revolutionary Communist \" label , though many were disillusioned by Avakian in the flesh .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "37.299164"}

{"text": "In the case of Trump , the answer is easy and obvious : what he says tends to nicely fit into this view .While Trump has authored several books , no one would accuse him of being an intellectual .Carson 's case is a bit more complicated .On the one hand , he is a well - educated neurosurgeon and is regarded as intelligent and thoughtful .On the other hand , he tends to make remarks that make him appear anti - intellectual and anti - science .Some claim that he is doing this in a calculated way to appeal to the baser nature of some of the Republican base .Others assert that his apparent missteps are due to his lack of experience in the realm of politics .Coincidentally , this leads to the next subject of consideration .Since the presidency is not an entry level job , it seems reasonable to expect that a candidate have relevant experience in similar jobs .It also seems reasonable to expect that the candidate would be accomplished in relevant ways , have held relevant positions , and have a good reputation that is relevant to the presidency .This is why many past presidents have been governors , military leaders or in congress before they moved to the oval office .While Trump has had experience in business and reality TV , he has not held political office .While some claim that executive business experience is relevant , it is certainly reasonable to consider that it is not an adequate substitute for experience in a political position .I , for example , would not claim that my experience in chairing committees , captaining athletic teams , and running classes would qualify me to be president .While Carson has some administrative experience , he is primarily a neurosurgeon .While this is certainly impressive , it does not seem relevant to his ability to be president .I , for example , am also a doctor and have written numerous books - but these would not seem to be large points in favor of me being president .Given the relatively weak qualifications of Trump and Carson in these areas , it might seem odd that they are currently trouncing former governor Jeb Bush , Senator Marco Rubio , Governor Scott Walker , Senator Rand Paul and former governor John Kasich .One easy explanation for the success of Trump and Carson is that Republican politicians and pundits adopted a tactic of waging rhetorical war against politicians , insiders , the establishment and government itself .In contrast , being a non - politician , a political outsider , a non - establishment person and against government were lauded as virtues .This tactic seems to have been too successful : the firehose that the Republican strategists struggled to keep targeted on Democrats seems to have slipped from their grip and is now hosing the more qualified candidates while Trump and Carson stay dry .The irony here is that those who are probably the best qualified to actually run the country ( such as Rubio , Bush and Kasich ) are currently regarded as undesirable precisely because of the qualities that make them qualified .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.605614"}

{"text": "Rather impressively , Trump decided to double - down on his claim rather than acknowledging that his claim is manifestly false .His confidence has also caused some of his supporters to accept his claim , typically with vague references about having some memory of something that would support Trump 's claim .This is consistent with the way ideologically motivated \" reasoning \" works : when confronted with evidence against a claim that is part of one 's ideologically identity , the strength of the belief becomes even stronger .This holds true across the political spectrum and into other areas as well .For example , people who strongly identify with the anti - vaccination movement not only dismiss the overwhelming scientific evidence against their views , they often double - down on their beliefs and some even take criticism as more proof that they are right .This tendency does make psychological sense - when part of a person 's identity is at risk , it is natural to engage in a form of wishful thinking and accept ( or reject ) a claim because one really wants the claim to be true ( or false ) .However , wishful thinking is fallacious thinking - wanting a claim to be true does not make it true .As such , this tendency is a defect in a person 's rationality and giving in to it will generally lead to poor decision making .There is also the fact that since at least the time of Nixon a narrative about liberal media bias has been constructed and implanted into the minds of many .This provides an all - purpose defense against almost any negative claims made by the media about conservatives .Because of this , Trump 's defenders can allege that the media covered up the story ( which would , of course , contradict his claim that he saw all those people in another city celebrating 9/11 ) or that they are now engaged in a conspiracy against Trump .A rather obvious problem with the claim that the media is engaged in some sort of conspiracy is that if Trump saw those thousands celebrating in New Jersey , then there should be no shortage of witnesses and video evidence .However , there are no witnesses and no such video evidence .This is because Trump 's claim is not true .While it would be easy to claim that Trump is simply lying , this might not be the case .As discussed in an earlier essay I wrote about presidential candidate Ben Carson 's untrue claims , a claim being false is not sufficient to make it a lie .For example , a person might say that he has $ 20 in his pocket but be wrong because a pickpocket stole it a few minutes ago .Her claim would be untrue , but it would be a mistake to accuse her of being a liar .While this oversimplifies things quite a bit , for Trump to be lying about this he would need to believe that what he is saying is not true and be engaged in the right ( or rather ) wrong sort of intent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.75499"}

{"text": "Also , I urge people to stop listening to Donald Trump .He has the right of free expression , but people also have the right of free listening .One interesting phenomenon is the tendency of people to double down on beliefs .For those not familiar with doubling down , this occurs when a person is confronted with evidence against a beloved belief and her belief , far from being weakened by the evidence , is strengthened .One rather plausible explanation of doubling down rests on Leon Festinger 's classic theory of cognitive dissonance .Roughly put , when a person has a belief that is threatened by evidence , she has two main choices .The first is to adjust her belief in accord with the evidence .If the evidence is plausible and strongly supports the logical inference that the belief is not true , then the rational thing to do is reject the old belief .If the evidence is not plausible or does not strongly support the logical inference that the belief is untrue , then it is rational to stick with the threatened belief on the grounds that the threat is not much of a threat .As might be suspected , the assessment of what is plausible evidence can be problematic .In general terms , assessing evidence involves considering how it matches one 's own observations , one 's background information about the matter , and credible sources .This assessment can merely push the matter back : the evidence for the evidence will also need to be assessed , which serves to fuel some classic skeptical arguments about the impossibility of knowledge .The idea is that every belief must be assessed and this would lead to an infinite regress , thus making knowing whether a belief is true or not impossible .Naturally , retreating into skepticism will not help when a person is responding to evidence against a beloved belief ( unless the beloved belief is a skeptical one)-the person wants her beloved belief to be true .As such , someone defending a beloved belief needs to accept that there is some evidence for the belief - even if the evidence is faith or some sort of revelation .In terms of assessing the reasoning , the matter is entirely objective if it is deductive logic .Deductive logic is such that if an argument is doing what it is supposed to do ( be valid ) , then if the premises are true , then the conclusion must be true .Deductive arguments can be assessed by such things as truth tables , Venn diagrams and proofs , thus the reasoning is objectively good or bad .Inductive reasoning is a different matter .While the premises of an inductive argument are supposed to support the conclusion , inductive arguments are such that true premises only make ( at best ) the conclusion likely to be true .Unlike deductive arguments , inductive arguments vary greatly in strength and while there are standards of assessment , reasonable people can disagree about the strength of an inductive argument .People can also embrace skepticism here , specifically the problem of induction : even when an inductive argument has all true premises and the reasoning is as good as inductive reasoning gets , the conclusion could still be false .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.09069"}
{"text": "To understand this , I think it 's important to give a little background into what I look for in the polls .When you look at the polls in the aggregate , I look for trends as to if a candidate seems to be on the rise or fall , but more importantly , I look for outliers .This is where Trump and Cruz have a significant downfall that may be overlooked by the media .The key to understanding the outlier I 'm observing is knowing more background on the polls than simply the numbers given .The key here is that the CBS News / YouGov poll is conducted online instead of telephone for the others .Another thing here to notice is the extremely small sample size for the CNN / ORC poll .With CNN 's track record with polls - like saying Sanders is up almost 30 points in New Hampshire - I exclude this from the observation .( Understand that this poll could be completely correct and all other others be incorrect , but with a small sample size and poor track record , I do not trust the accuracy of this poll . )So , what is the observation here ?The CBS / YouGov poll appears to be an outlier from all the others .The average of three polls before and after the CBS / YouGov poll for Trump is 30.5 .For Cruz , it 's 26.3 .Both Trump 's and Cruz 's CBS / YouGov percentages are about 8 % above this average .What does this mean for the candidates ?It means Trump and Cruz supporters are more likely to express their opinions behind some secrecy - whether it be the internet or the curtain of a polling booth .However , that is not how the Iowa Caucus works .For the Iowa Caucus , you have to show up and discuss the candidates with your friends and neighbors .Then , you vote sitting next to your friends and neighbors .There is a social stigma against voting for Trump and Cruz , and this could greatly hurt them on the caucus night .Remember : an internet poll is almost completely secret ; however , a telephone poll still has some secrecy .When you talk to someone on the phone , there is still a wall between the communication .There is some social stigma , but not as much as if you were to speak to someone face - to - face .On caucus night , they will be face - to - face with people who know them and the social stigma will be present .Sway - able people will be convinced to go with the crowd , and this benefits the Rubio and Carson campaigns .Additionally , Rubio has been on a good trend lately .The last 4 polls have him on an 11 - 13 - 16 - 18 trend .With a good debate performance tonight , he does have a shot at winning this caucus .Even though I still think Cruz will win on his ground game , do n't count Rubio out at this point .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.111366"}

Bush , a winner only technically ( every victory has been meticulously crafted and hand - delivered to him by others ) , assumed that winning Iraq would come as easily as everything else had in his life .For the first time he met real defeat , and his only solace , it seems , comes from the myopic belief that history will prove him a winner .Obama 's bootstrap - biography and rationally sanguine temperament , the flip - side of Bush 's entitlement and intransigent faith , will sell voters on the idea that we need not be tainted by this inevitable loss , and , in November , will likely make him the winner .I 'm watching George Carlin 's latest HBO show and he 's talking about the \" slef esteem movement \" and how kids never hear the phrase \" you lost ! \"anymore .It got me thinking about my 15 month old boy .One of the things I 've read about , and noticed in him ... is that at this age ... kids like to read the same books ( and parts of books ) over and over again , because they know what word is coming up next .And they like the feeling of getting the word right .It 's also why they will say \" done ! \" as soon as their favorite pages is done ( the one where they get to say \" duck ! \" or whatever ) .The same thought process seems to apply to sports .At a young age , you are having them play , not to learn the value of competition or winning and losing , but rather just to learn the sport , get exercise , and have fun .At that age , everyone gets to play .At what age do you think kids should switch from KumByYa - sports to competitive - sports ?I never played any sport that was \" for fun \" .There 's always a winner and a loser and it 's better to be the winner .I wo nt sign my future kid up for any sports leagues that do n't keep score , do n't have standings or playoffs and do n't crown a champion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.516182"}

{"text": "That said , the anti - establishment sentiment should not be dismissed : if Cruz can maintain the appearance of being a political outsider while using the skill set he has developed as a career politician , he stands an excellent chance of having the best of both worlds .While Sanders is a long - time senator , he is regarded as an authentic outsider .This is in strong contrast with Hillary Clinton .She has a well - established reputation as a supreme insider and is certainly not known for her authenticity .The challenge for Sanders is maintaining enthusiasm in the face of the Clinton political machine .Fortunately for Bernie , we have seen that the Clinton machine can be defeated and Hillary is no doubt worried that 2016 might look like a repeat of 2008 .Only with an old white socialist rather than a young black moderate in the starring role .We might see Rubio going up against Sanders in the general election .If so , I would predict Rubio by a slight margin .Clinton would probably beat Rubio .Cruz and Trump , I think , would lose to either Clinton or Sanders .But , my predictions are probably wrong - much is up in the air , which makes matters interesting .In January , 2016 Denmark passed a law that refugees who enter the state with assets greater than about US $ 1,450 will have their valuables taken in order to help pay for the cost of their being in the country .In response to international criticism , Denmark modified the law to allow refugees to keep items of sentimental value , such as wedding rings .This matter is certainly one of moral concern .Critics have been quick to deploy a Nazi analogy , likening this policy to how the Nazis stole the valuables of those they sent to the concentration camps .While taking from refugees does seem morally problematic , the Nazi analogy does not really stick - there are too many relevant differences between the situations .Most importantly , the Danes would be caring for the refugees rather than murdering them .There is also the fact that the refugees are voluntarily going to Denmark rather than being rounded up , robbed , imprisoned and murdered .While the Danes have clearly not gone full Nazi , there are still grounds for moral criticism .However , I will endeavor to provide a short defense of the law - a rational consideration requires at least considering the pro side of the argument .The main motivation of the law seems to be to deter refugees from coming to Denmark .This is a strategy of making their country less appealing than other countries in the hopes that refugees will go somewhere else and be someone else 's burden .Countries , like individuals , do seem to have the right to make themselves less appealing .While this sort of approach is certainly not morally commendable , it does not seem to be morally wrong .After all , the Danes are not simply banning refugees but trying to provide a financial disincentive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.176567"}

{"text": "His question : Given that next month 's Iowa caucuses are shaping up as a contest between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz , whom would they prefer come out on top ? \"The clear win\u00adner , \" he writes , \" was Trump .\" It is important to understand why - and it certainly is n't because these people would prefer to have Trump as the nominee .The first reason is that they believe Trump can not win the nomination in the end , even in the event he wins Iowa .The second is that they despise Cruz so much that it is interfering with their rational thinking .They do not view Cruz as a savior from Trump , as many conservatives view him , or as the one to blunt his momentum going forward .Rather , they view Cruz as the real problem , whereas Trump is just a harmless amusement who will pass away .We view this as a serious error .The party regulars ( or the so - called \" establishment \" ) is taking the modern party 's foundational ideas ( with which , over time , they have made their peace ) and their endurance for granted .We share the view that Trump can not win , but believe Cruz must play a major part in stopping him , making an indispensable contribution to Trump 's downfall .The risk of a Trump win in Iowa is that he becomes unstoppable after that .The virtue of a Trump defeat there - from the perspective of conservatives who oppose him - is that his support in the states that follow is mostly the product of celebrity and his status as the apparent frontrunner .That will all vanish if he evaporates in Iowa .Why the hatred for Cruz ?It surely goes back to the perception , based on his short and explosive tenure in the Senate , that he is not a team player .This is true ( for better or worse ) , and the 2013 shutdown , which could have had catastrophic consequences for the party if not for the HealthCare.gov disaster that immediately followed , was entirely his fault .But believe it or not , that shutdown was mostly inside baseball .It directly affected very few Americans at the time it happened .And so we have a paradox : From an ideological perspective , Cruz is more or less a real Reaganite .He is very much within the tradition of modern conservatism ( as are most of the other remaining GOP candidates , ranging from Jeb Bush to Rand Paul ) .That is something Trump can not claim to be , as he seems to be embracing a blood - and - soil nationalist idea that is more common among the European Right and alien to American ways .A Trump nomination would mark a massive ideological departure for the GOP .It would mean the end to the more libertarian and fusionistic Reaganist ideology as the driving Republican philosophy - again , a philosophy with which the GOP establishment has finally more or less made peace .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.95713"}

{"text": "Another candidate could certainly rise from obscurity in the next few days , but let 's have a look at what sort of path these four candidates must follow if they are to win .Donald Trump has been the nominal GOP frontrunner for about six months .In some ways he has been annoying to Republicans , but in others helpful .After all , by making himself a lightning rod for negative media attention , he has deflected it from others .But as for Trump 's actual chances of winning , they are a lot more remote than they seem .His Iowa result may prove to be a historic disaster , not unlike what Howard Dean suffered in 2004 , simply because he has no ground game to speak of .The New York Times reported before Christmas that he had precinct captains for less than 10 percent of the locations where Iowans will caucus next month .That puts him light years behind Cruz and even Rubio , and it suggests that he will vastly underperform whatever poll numbers he carries into the end of January .Remember : Caucuses are much more involved than primaries , and require voters to give up an entire evening on a weeknight .It 's very hard to get people to caucus .Campaigns that depend on drawing out first - time caucus - goers - precisely Trump 's strategy - tend to fail .Moreover , although this aspect is a bit less critical in simple primary - voting states like New Hampshire and South Carolina , the Times notes that his get - out - the - vote operation is even weaker in those places than it is in Iowa .Trump 's new campaign ad - the first for which he has paid for airtime - simply repeats his most controversial proposals ( no Muslims , Mexico pays for a border wall ) rather than trying to cast him in a positive light .This is very unconventional indeed , but the convention exists for a reason .It usually helps candidates to start on such a positive note .The most likely outcome we see is Trump losing Iowa by an unexpectedly large margin , and then his support suddenly falling off elsewhere .But he may do better than that and live on into New Hampshire , in which case he will complicate the race for others .There is also a slim chance he wins there and regains the momentum .The big question for him , really , is whether the Iowa result is perceived as doing better than expected or suffering a huge , humiliating defeat .It could really go either way .Ted Cruz is the frontrunner at this moment - there is no question .He is favored to win in Iowa , and he is polling strong enough elsewhere ( he is second or third in New Hampshire ) that an Iowa win could well bump him into contention , and bump Trump into irrelevance .Cruz is probably done for if he somehow loses Iowa , but this appears to be increasingly unlikely .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.34937"}

S. : Executive power , and the scope of executive power tends to grow with every new crisis and never are all the new powers returned to the people and laid down by the executive .My guess is , that like other ancient democratic forms of government , if the growth of executive power is not checked , then this trend will eventually result in the office of the Presidency morphing into an effectively absolute ruler some time in the next few centuries .It 's one of the reasons that all the social studies teachers I ever had , described the U.S. as a great and ongoing experiment in government .Their message was always that we must actively engage our democratic system to make it suitable for living under , or eventually it will be become an untenable form of government just like dictatorship 's become untenable when they fail to meet the needs of the governed .The power is in our hands to do something about it and I would hate to give that up for a little security or pomp and circumstance .It 's not a perfect system , but we can and should improve it wherever we can .The real difference between our system and absolute rule by a single individual is not really the democracy parts , since you could ( and I think people did in the past ( Spartans ? ) ) elect absolute rulers , even if it was an uncommon practice .For me the real difference is the splitting of pre - US constitution executive power , into the three branches of government , executive , legislative , and judiciary .Prior to our splitting apart of these 3 sets of powers they were all held by absolute rulers of the U.K and elsewhere , but our splitting apart of them has resulted in a unique set of checks and balances that has given us many benefits .Also , it 's easy to romanticize about monarchy at this point in time , because the monarch 's of the U.K. are no longer seen as threatening .After all , they have no real governmental power any longer , compared to what they used to possess , so the pageantry can easily evoke a powerful nostalgia , but only because we did n't live through all the bad shit of being ruled by an absolute power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.877594"}

{"text": "The mere fact that the rhetoric is extreme and offensive to some is not grounds for regarding it as morally wrong .However , being merely morally tolerable is not a very exalted status .I have a preference for civil discourse that avoids needlessly heated rhetoric , but perhaps this is but a personal preference .Another answer is linked to the untruths that have been used in the rhetoric .While truth seems to matter little in politics , it still matters in ethics .As such , intentionally making untrue claims about Planned Parenthood would seem to be wrong , at least on the assumption that lying is wrong .It could , of course , be argued that such untruths can be justified on utilitarian grounds - which is a standard way to justify lying .Since the killings at the clinic constituted a mass shooting , the conversation would not be complete without the raising of a stock talking point about good guys with guns .The honor fell to Payne to say \" And also , what if more people had guns there , guys ?\" One problem with reaching a rational conclusion about the effectiveness of armed civilians in preventing or mitigating crime is that there is a lack of good data on gun violence .Pointing to some examples in which the good guy with a gun saved the day is relevant , but is still essentially anecdotal evidence .Likewise , pointing to examples in which it did not work out is also relevant , yet still anecdotal .As such , my view is that claims about the value of guns in this regard are largely unsupported - as are claims about their lack of value .However , it is certainly possible to speculate based on the available information and that seems to indicate that the crime fighting value of armed civilians is a rather mixed bag .As this is being written at the end of November , Donald Trump is still the leading Republican presidential candidate .While some might take the view that this is in spite of the outrageous and terrible things Trump says , a better explanation is that he is doing well because of this behavior .Some regard it as evidence of his authenticity and find it appealing in the face of so many slick and seemingly inauthentic politicians ( Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush are regarded by some as examples of this ) .Some agree with what Trump says and thus find this behavior very appealing .Trump was immediately called on this claim on the grounds that it is completely untrue .While it would be as reasonable to dismiss Trump 's false claim as it would be to dismiss any other claim that is quite obviously untrue , the Washington Post and Politifact undertook a detailed investigation .On the one hand , it seems needless to dignify such a falsehood with investigation .On the other hand , since Trump is the leading Republican candidate , his claims could be regarded as meriting the courtesy of a fact check rather than simple dismissal as being patently ludicrous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.98297"}

{"text": "Let 's look at Iowa with Cruz .His people on the ground clearly had the incentive to spin the story that Cruz had a bad debate as an effort to get his voters to the polls .The caucus - goers would hear things such as , \" This was the media choosing winners and losers . \"Additionally , he got the added bonus of people writing news articles about him .With this added attention , it drove potential Cruz - leaning caucus goers to his rallies in the past few days for him to easily claim Iowa .Now , let 's turn to Marco Rubio , so I can predict what will happen Tuesday .Pundits claim Marco Rubio lost the debate for one exchange with Chris Christie early on in the debate Saturday night .As Christie put it , the media 's desire to crown Rubio as the Establishment candidate went up in flames that night .I 'll get this out of the way : Keep dreaming Chris Christie .I look forward to hearing your speech to drop out of the race Tuesday night or Wednesday morning .If anything , this is a speed bump in Rubio 's current surge in polling .When you look at the actual numbers , I do n't think Rubio has anything to worry about Tuesday night , like Cruz did n't have anything to worry about last Monday .I predict Trump will win New Hampshire , but by a smaller margin than the polls state because we have seen the over - exaggeration of Trump 's support in the polls already .Rubio will finish second , probably in the mid to upper teens .Then , it 's a tight race for third place .I think at this point Cruz will edge out Kasich for third .Here 's why I believe Rubio does n't have much to worry about : . 1 )This was the first debate Trump lost his dominant social media presence .He edged out Rubio on Twitter , but lost to him on Google .What I find interesting here is two - fold .First is that the Christie moment measured just as high as other strong Rubio moments .Secondly , the large spike in interest at the end was the moment that drove people to google Rubio the most .It was his answer on abortion where he said he would \" rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life .\" 2 ) Rubio people said that answer he gave on abortion drove people to their website in such high volume that they raised triple the highest amount of money they raised in any previous debate .People talk with money .They do n't hand money over as easily as a vote either .Where the money is going to candidates , so is the passion .3 ) Rubio 's Google interest ( as well as Ted Cruz 's ) has kept up with Donald Trump in New Hampshire and is starting to draw large crowds .People do n't vote based on a single debate - especially in New Hampshire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.80306"}

{"text": "From a rational standpoint , a person should consider an elected office as a job and herself as the employer who is engaged in evaluating the candidate .As such , the expertise of the candidate should be a rather important factor .What should also be considered are the personal qualities needed to do the job well , such as dependability , integrity and so on .A person should also consider the extent to which the candidate will act in her self - interest and also the extent to which the candidate will act in accord with her values .While a person 's self - interest and values can be consistent with each other , there can be a conflict .For example , it might be in the self - interest of a wealthy person for taxes on the rich to be lowered , but his values might such that he favors shifting more of the tax burden to the wealthy .When considering whether a candidate has the needed expertise or not , the main factors include education , experience , accomplishments , position , and reputation .I will begin by considering education .While education is usually looked at in terms of formal education , it can also include what is learned outside of the classroom .While there is no degree offered in being - the - president it is certainly worth considering the education of candidates and its relevance towards the office they are seeking .In this case , the office is the presidency .Carson has an M.D. and is clearly well educated .Trump is also an educated man , albeit not a brain surgeon .Interestingly , influential elements in the Republican have pushed an anti - intellectual and anti - science line over the years .As such , it is hardly a surprise that some Republicans like to compare Obama to a professor and intend for this comparison to be an insult .The anti - science leaning has , in recent years , been very strong in regards to the science of climate change .However , it is well worth noting that the opposition to science and intellectualism seems to be driven primarily by an ideological opposition to specific positions in science .Those on the left are often cast as being in favor of science and intellectualism - in large part , perhaps , due to the fact that scientists and intellectuals tend to lean more left than right .However , a plausible case can be made that some of the pro - science and pro - intellectual leaning of the left also comes from ideology - that is , leftists like the science and intellectualism that matches their world views .As an example , the left tends to be pro - environment and this fits in nicely with the science of climate change .Interestingly , when science goes against a view held by some left leaning folks , they will attack and reject science with the same sort of \" arguments \" that are employed by their fellows on the right .One good example of this is the sort of anti - vaccination people who reject the scientific evidence in favor of their ideology .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.284065"}

'How is he going to pay for all that ? \" Clinton 's ambitions seemed to be judged more realistic .Then , there was the problem of comfort .The Clintons seem to intuitively understand the value of retail politics , particularly when doing outreach to marginalized groups .I ca n't tell you how many stories I 've heard from black people about the time that one of the Clintons - most often Bill Clinton - spoke at or showed up at an event important to the black community .This means something .It adds to an aura of familiarity that does n't extend to Sanders .( Some may recognize the phrase \" I 'll make me a world \" as a line in James Weldon Johnson 's \" The Creation \" from his 1927 book of poems \" God 's Trombones : Seven Negro Sermons in Verse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.6511"}

{"text": "After recent terrorist attacks , many people in the United States have embraced negative stereotypes about Muslims , such as the idea that they are all terrorists .This sort of stereotyping leads to similar mistakes that arise from hasty generalizations : reasoning about a threat based on stereotypes will tend to lead to an error in assessment .The defense against a stereotype is to seriously inquire whether the stereotype is true or not .This stereotype has been used as a base ( or fuel ) for a stock rhetorical tool , that of demonizing .Demonizing , in this context , involves portraying a group as evil and dangerous .This can be seen as a specialized form of hyperbole in that it exaggerates the evil of the group and the danger it represents .Demonizing is often combined with scapegoating - blaming a person or group for problems they are not actually responsible for .A person can demonize on her own or be subject to the demonizing rhetoric of others .Demonizing presents a clear threat to rational threat assessment .If a group is demonized successfully , it will be ( by definition ) regarded as more evil and dangerous than it really is .As such , both the assessment of the probability and severity of the threat will be distorted .For example , the demonization of Muslims by various politicians and pundits influences some people to make errors in assessing the danger presented by Muslims in general and Syrian refugees in particular .The defense against demonizing is similar to the defense against stereotypes - a serious inquiry into whether the claims are true or are , in fact , demonizing .It is worth noting that what might seem to be demonizing might be an accurate description .This is because demonizing is , like hyperbole , exaggerating the evil of and danger presented by a group .If the description is true , then it would not be demonizing .Put informally , describing a group as evil and dangerous need not be demonizing .For example , this description would match the Khmer Rouge .While stereotyping and demonizing are mere rhetorical devices , there are also fallacies that distort threat assessment .Not surprisingly , one of this is scare tactics ( also known as appeal to fear ) .This fallacy involves substituting something intended to create fear in the target in place of evidence for a claim .While scare tactics can be used in other ways , it can be used to distort threat assessment .One aspect of its distortion is the use of fear - when people are afraid , they tend to overestimate the probability and severity of threats .Scare tactics is also used to feed fear - one fear can be used to get people to accept a claim that makes them even more afraid .One thing that is especially worrisome about scare tactics in the context of terrorism is that in addition to making people afraid , it is also routinely used to \" justify \" encroachments on rights , massive spending , and the abandonment of important moral values .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.48876"}

{"text": "While Stephen Colbert ended up as a successful comedian , he originally planned to major in philosophy .His past occasionally returns to haunt him with digressions from the land of comedy into the realm of philosophy ( though detractors might claim that philosophy is comedy without humor ; but that is actually law ) .Colbert has what seems to be an odd epistemology : he regularly claims that he believes in things he knows are not true , such as guardian angels .While it would be easy enough to dismiss this claim as merely comedic , it does raise many interesting philosophical issues .The main and most obvious issue is whether a person can believe in something they know is not true .While a thorough examination of this issue would require a deep examination of the concepts of belief , truth and knowledge , I will take a shortcut and go with intuitively plausible stock accounts of these concepts .To believe something is to hold the opinion that it is true .A belief is true , in the common sense view , when it gets reality right - this is the often maligned correspondence theory of truth .The stock simple account of knowledge in philosophy is that a person knows that P when the person believes P , P is true , and the belief in P is properly justified .The justified true belief account of knowledge has been savagely blooded by countless attacks , but shall suffice for this discussion .Given this basic analysis , it would seem impossible for a person to believe in something they know is not true .This would require that the person believes something is true when they also believe it is false .To use the example of God , a person would need to believe that it is true that God exists and false that God exists .This would seem to commit the person to believing that a contradiction is true , which is problematic because a contradiction is always false .One possible response is to point out that the human mind is not beholden to the rules of logic - while a contradiction can not be true , there are many ways a person can hold to contradictory beliefs .One possibility is that the person does not realize that the beliefs contradict one another and hence they can hold to both .This might be due to an ability to compartmentalize the beliefs so they are never in the consciousness at the same time or due to a failure to recognize the contradiction .Another possibility is that the person does not grasp the notion of contradiction and hence does not realize that they can not logically accept the truth of two beliefs that are contradictory .While these responses do have considerable appeal , they do not appear to work in cases in which the person actually claims , as Colbert does , that they believe something they know is not true .After all , making this claim does require considering both beliefs in the same context and , if the claim of knowledge is taken seriously , that the person is aware that the rejection of the belief is justified sufficiently to qualify as knowledge .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.52766"}

{"text": "This stereotype has been used as a base ( or fuel ) for a stock rhetorical tool , that of demonizing .Demonizing , in this context , involves portraying a group as evil and dangerous .This can be seen as a specialized form of hyperbole in that it exaggerates the evil of the group and the danger it represents .Demonizing is often combined with scapegoating - blaming a person or group for problems they are not actually responsible for .A person can demonize on her own or be subject to the demonizing rhetoric of others .Demonizing presents a clear threat to rational threat assessment .If a group is demonized successfully , it will be ( by definition ) regarded as more evil and dangerous than it really is .As such , both the assessment of the probability and severity of the threat will be distorted .For example , the demonization of Muslims by various politicians and pundits influences some people to make errors in assessing the danger presented by Muslims in general and Syrian refugees in particular .The defense against demonizing is similar to the defense against stereotypes - a serious inquiry into whether the claims are true or are , in fact , demonizing .It is worth noting that what might seem to be demonizing might be an accurate description .This is because demonizing is , like hyperbole , exaggerating the evil of and danger presented by a group .If the description is true , then it would not be demonizing .Put informally , describing a group as evil and dangerous need not be demonizing .For example , this description would match the Khmer Rouge .While stereotyping and demonizing are mere rhetorical devices , there are also fallacies that distort threat assessment .Not surprisingly , one of this is scare tactics ( also known as appeal to fear ) .This fallacy involves substituting something intended to create fear in the target in place of evidence for a claim .While scare tactics can be used in other ways , it can be used to distort threat assessment .One aspect of its distortion is the use of fear - when people are afraid , they tend to overestimate the probability and severity of threats .Scare tactics is also used to feed fear - one fear can be used to get people to accept a claim that makes them even more afraid .One thing that is especially worrisome about scare tactics in the context of terrorism is that in addition to making people afraid , it is also routinely used to \" justify \" encroachments on rights , massive spending , and the abandonment of important moral values .While courage is an excellent defense against this fallacy , asking two important questions also helps .The first is to ask \" should I be afraid ? \" and the second is to ask \" even if I am afraid , is the claim actually true ? \" For example , scare tactics has been used to \" support \" the claim that Syrian refugees should not be allowed into the United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.62956"}

Cappella and Kathleen Hall Jamieson address themselves in Spiral of Cynicism : The Press and the Public Good .While much of the book is a fairly technical presentation of statistical evidence drawn from controlled experiments , they make their project a matter for concern to any political observer .At bottom , they challenge the reader to reflect on some big questions : What is politics ?How can we understand the activity of politics ?With what other human activities can it best be compared ?And with what other activities would a comparison yield deleterious consequences for political life ?News coverage , like all communication , operates in metaphors , and the metaphors commonly deployed to communicate political events and issues are those of sports and war .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.981735"}

Altemeyer , a psychologist who has extensively studied people with right - wing beliefs , has observed : .[ Right - wing authoritarians ] see the world as a dangerous place , as society teeters on the brink of self - destruction from evil and violence .This fear appears to instigate aggression in them .Second , right - wing authoritarians tend to be highly self righteous .They think themselves much more moral and upstanding than others - a self perception considerably aided by self - deception ....This self - righteousness disinhibits their aggressive impulses and releases them to act out their fear - induced hostilities .George Will seems steeped in that fear .To illustrate that point the authors quote this passage from an essay by Will : \" Conservatives know the world is a dark and forbidding place where most new knowledge is false , most improvements are for the worse .\" Psychological studies back Will up .People with right - wing personalities hold more pessimistic views and left - wing personalities hold more optimistic ones .And that pessimism and optimism appears to inform how conservatives and liberals view their fellow humans .A 1984 survey of \" emotional reactions to welfare recipients \" found that conservatives \" expressed greater disgust and less sympathy \" than liberals .The authors speculate that this susceptibility to fear \" may help explain why military defense spending and support for national security receive much stronger backing from conservative than liberal political leaders .Afraid of loss .It has long been known that conservatives resist change while progressives accept change .Indeed , according to studies , this is the most common way that people from both groups self - define themselves .To the extent that conservatives are especially sensitive to the possibilities of loss - one reason why they wish to preserve the status quo - it follows that they should be generally more motivated by negatively framed outcomes ( potential losses ) than by positively framed outcomes ( potential gains ) .Consequently , conservatives respond better to threats .More generally , the authors suggest that \" framing events in terms of potential losses rather than gains leads people to adopt cognitively conservative , as opposed to innovative , orientations .Haunted by death .Of course , the greatest personal loss is death .Studies demonstrate that the people who most fear death are the most conservative . \"Similarly , the fear of death has also been linked to \" system - justifying forms of stereotyping and enhanced liking for stereotype - consistent women and minority group members \" and \" greater punitiveness , and even aggression , toward those who violate cultural values .\" Applying that knowledge , the authors write , \" High profile terrorist attacks such as those of September 11 , 2001 , might simultaneously increase the cognitive accessibility of death and the appeal of political conservatism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.08355"}

{"text": "Even though I do nt like this way of campaigning , canidates practice this method because it has been shown to work in the past .This negative campiagning also works because it gives people a reason not to vote for a candidate and then vote for the other when positive campaigning only gives people a reason to vote for one but no reason to not vote for the other .Negative campaigning has worked in the past so from a candidates point of view its necessary to practice this method to win the votes .I do nt like this method because then people vote for candidates based on their morals rather than who will enforce the better policies and knows how to lead and make good decisions .I agree with this post from just watching political ads over the past decade .Clearly voters seem to gain more interest in negative ads because of the information that can slander and denounce the other members running in the election .I can even say I loved to hear what he / she had done wrong or how bad it is that he / she does n't support pro - life .Without these curveballs in political campaigns the average voter wo n't obtain the information about both parites .I agree that politicians are getting wrapped up in just making their opponents look bad , and quite honestly I think it is irritating .During the months prior to election I get so sick and tired of hearing the Democrats candidate bashing the Republican candidate and vice versa .After a while of listening to it , you do n't know who to believe .I believe that political candidates need to stick to campaigning for themselves as opposed to campaigning against their opponent .Before I vote for someone I want to know their policies and their take on certain subjects rather than what their opponent did 10 years ago that made everyone mad .Negative campaigning is so annoying to hear over and over again , so they need to freshen things up and start talking about what they are going to do to try to help us .I agree with this post after paying more and more attention to ad campaigns over the years as I have grown closer to the voting age and even more when I passed it .It is easier to see an negative campaign ad and say yea he 's right , as i believe it is easier to make one .When potentially voting for someone , I personally need to know how good his or her policy is and why , not why he or she thinks the opponent 's policy is flawed .If people do n't do that , then they can never truly know what they are voting for outside of he does n't like that policy .I think this is an interesting way of looking at political campaigns .I agree with some points and I believe the past Presidential election of 2008 serves as an excellent example for candidates avoiding the minute details of their platforms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.6743"}

{"text": "The defense against this bias is to find reliable statistical data and use that as the basis for inferences about threats - that is , think it through rather than trying to feel through it .This is , of course , very difficult : people tend to regard their feelings , however unwarranted , as the best evidence - despite it is usually the worst evidence .People are also misled about probability by various fallacies .One is the spotlight fallacy .The spotlight fallacy is committed when a person uncritically assumes that all ( or many ) members or cases of a certain class or type are like those that receive the most attention or coverage in the media .After an incident involving terrorists who are Muslim , media attention is focused on that fact , leading people who are poor at reasoning to infer that most Muslims are terrorists .This is the exact sort of mistake that would occur if it were inferred that most Christians are terrorists because the media covered a terrorist who was Christian ( who shot up a Planned Parenthood ) .If people believe that , for example , most Muslims are terrorists , then they will make incorrect inferences about the probability of a domestic terrorist attack by Muslims .Anecdotal evidence is another fallacy that contributes to poor inferences about the probability of a threat .This fallacy is committed when a person draws a conclusion about a population based on an anecdote ( a story ) about one or a very small number of cases .The fallacy is also committed when someone rejects reasonable statistical data supporting a claim in favor of a single example or small number of examples that go against the claim .This fallacy is similar to hasty generalization and a similar sort of error is committed , namely drawing an inference based on a sample that is inadequate in size relative to the conclusion .The main difference between hasty generalization and anecdotal evidence is that the fallacy anecdotal evidence involves using a story ( anecdote ) as the sample .People often fall victim to this fallacy because stories and anecdotes tend to have more psychological influence than statistical data .This leads people to infer that what is true in an anecdote must be true of the whole population or that an anecdote justifies rejecting statistical evidence in favor of said anecdote .Not surprisingly , people most commonly accept this fallacy because they want to believe that what is true in the anecdote is true for the whole population .In the case of terrorism , people use both anecdotal evidence and hasty generalization : they point to a few examples of domestic terrorism or tell the story about a specific incident , and then draw an unwarranted conclusion about the probability of a terrorist attack occurring .For example , people point to the claim that one of the terrorists in Paris masqueraded as a refugee and infer that refugees pose a great threat to the United States .Or they tell the story about the one attacker in San Bernardino who arrived in the states on a K-1 ( \" fianc\u00e9 \" ) visa and make unwarranted conclusions about the danger of the visa system ( which is used by about 25,000 people a year ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.83333"}

{"text": "While an event that occurs often will tend to be thought of often , the fact that something is often thought of does not make it more likely to occur .After an incident of domestic terrorism , people think about terrorism far more often and thus tend to unconsciously believe that the chance of terrorism occurring is far higher than it really is .To use a non - terrorist example , when people hear about a shark attack , they tend to think that the chances of it occurring are high - even though the probability is incredibly low ( driving to the beach is vastly more likely to kill you than a shark is ) .The defense against this bias is to find reliable statistical data and use that as the basis for inferences about threats - that is , think it through rather than trying to feel through it .This is , of course , very difficult : people tend to regard their feelings , however unwarranted , as the best evidence - despite it is usually the worst evidence .People are also misled about probability by various fallacies .One is the spotlight fallacy .The spotlight fallacy is committed when a person uncritically assumes that all ( or many ) members or cases of a certain class or type are like those that receive the most attention or coverage in the media .After an incident involving terrorists who are Muslim , media attention is focused on that fact , leading people who are poor at reasoning to infer that most Muslims are terrorists .This is the exact sort of mistake that would occur if it were inferred that most Christians are terrorists because the media covered a terrorist who was Christian ( who shot up a Planned Parenthood ) .If people believe that , for example , most Muslims are terrorists , then they will make incorrect inferences about the probability of a domestic terrorist attack by Muslims .Anecdotal evidence is another fallacy that contributes to poor inferences about the probability of a threat .This fallacy is committed when a person draws a conclusion about a population based on an anecdote ( a story ) about one or a very small number of cases .The fallacy is also committed when someone rejects reasonable statistical data supporting a claim in favor of a single example or small number of examples that go against the claim .This fallacy is similar to hasty generalization and a similar sort of error is committed , namely drawing an inference based on a sample that is inadequate in size relative to the conclusion .The main difference between hasty generalization and anecdotal evidence is that the fallacy anecdotal evidence involves using a story ( anecdote ) as the sample .People often fall victim to this fallacy because stories and anecdotes tend to have more psychological influence than statistical data .This leads people to infer that what is true in an anecdote must be true of the whole population or that an anecdote justifies rejecting statistical evidence in favor of said anecdote .Not surprisingly , people most commonly accept this fallacy because they want to believe that what is true in the anecdote is true for the whole population .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.1617"}

{"text": "Since society has limited resources , rationally using them requires considering the probability of threats rationally - otherwise resources are being misspent .There is also the concern about the harm of creating fear and anger that are unfounded .In addition to the psychological harm to individuals that arise from living in fear and anger , there is also the damage stereotyping , demonizing , scare tactics and appeal to anger do to society as a whole .While anger and fear can unify people , they most often unify by dividing - pitting us against them .As in my previous essay , I urge people to think through threats rather than giving in to the seductive demons of fear and anger .When engaged in rational threat assessment , there are two main factors that need to be considered .The first is the probability of the threat .The second is , very broadly speaking , the severity of the threat .These two can be combined into one sweeping question : \" how likely is it that this will happen and , if it does , how bad will it be ? \"Making rational decisions about dangers involves considering both of these factors .For example , consider the risks of going to a crowded area such as a movie theater or school .There is a high probability of being exposed to the cold virus , but it is a very low severity threat .There is an exceedingly low probability that there will be a mass shooting , but it is a high severity threat since it can result in injury or death .While humans have done a fairly good job at surviving , this seems to have been despite our amazingly bad skills at rational threat assessment .To be specific , the worry people feel in regards to a threat generally does not match up with the actual probability of the threat occurring .People do seem somewhat better at assessing the severity , though they are also often in error about this .Given that an American is vastly more likely to be killed while driving than killed by a terrorist , it might be wondered why people are so incredibly bad at this sort of threat assessment .The answer , in regards to having fear vastly out of proportion to the probability is easy enough - it involves a cognitive bias and some classic fallacies .People follow general rules when they estimate probabilities and the ones we use unconsciously are called heuristics .While the right way to estimate probability is to use proper statistical methods , people generally fall victim to the bias known as the availability heuristic .The idea is that a person unconsciously assigns a probability to something based on how often they think of that sort of event .While an event that occurs often will tend to be thought of often , the fact that something is often thought of does not make it more likely to occur .After an incident of domestic terrorism , people think about terrorism far more often and thus tend to unconsciously believe that the chance of terrorism occurring is far higher than it really is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.81623"}

{"text": "But correlation is n't causation , and causation is only accessible through rational thinking .By basing a policy on correlation , you may as well act on the causes and indeed increase the effects as you may deteriorate the causes while trying to increase the effects .That 's perhaps why you 'll see a lot of irrational economists and sociologists doing lots of statistics .Because statistics , applications of Bayes law , etc . , map directly into emotional networks .But at the same time , they are devoid of causation and thus can never prove anything , can never bring any information useful to decision - making , can never reach any conclusion that is n't purposefully injected by the sociologist .There are good uses of statistics , but not as explanations , only as facts to be accounted for by theories of causation , and only by comparing statistics before and after some event happening ( or not happening ) in different ways among different test sets .As we saw above , reason is a tool that can be used but on top of a body of facts , values , energy , etc .In formal logic , the G\u00f6del theorem proved that in a strong sense , logic can not stand by itself without such a body of axioms , whereas such a body of axioms can never be complete .However , when Reason is developed , it opens opportunities for more elaborate contracts to be used and more elaborate social constructs to be built : Reason can reveal solutions that would not be chosen otherwise .Interestingly , after these solutions become well - known and widely accepted , they become a habit and reason is no more necessary for their enforcement and instead becomes necessary for their abandon when they they are not a best fit anymore .Hence , Reason and tradition participate in an evolutionary process of progress : through technological and organisational innovation , it allows people to discover new alternative ways to manage their values and resources ; it helps them implement new solutions and makes them aware of new potential conflicts .Reason may tell us a lot about some general rules to follow so that this evolution be for the better rather than for the worse , but it ca n't predict the details of this evolution beforehand anymore than it can justify the details of it afterwards .Ultimately , when faced with a difficult choice , we must follow general principles rooted in emotion , even though we may in calmer times examine these principles and structure them based on reason .This attitude of condemning reason whereas it is but a tool in the hands of emotions , is a particular case of the phenomenon whereby accuse a tool is accused instead of the bad emotion that leads to misuse of the tool .Defenders of the 2 nd amendment to the Constitution of the USA will appreciate .It is remarkable that in English - speaking country , we did win the word \" libertarian \" by conquest , whereas it was used mostly by people who were either openly collectivists , or by individualists that had accepted a lot of collectivist paradigms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.15253"}

{"text": "Expressing one 's feelings is certainly not always the most rational thing to do .For one thing , the evaluations that emotions register need not represent one 's considered view of the situation .But there is always pro tanto reason for expressing emotion , in the way thinking that p is a pro tanto reason for saying \" p , \" even if it is ultimately defeated by countervailing reasons .That it manifests a state of mind is a consideration in its favor .The reasons that emotions provide on this account are supposed to be justifying reasons , reasons in a normative sense -- good reasons , at least as far as they go .There is some resistance to according emotions this role , in part because it seems to cross categories of emotion - versus - reason , but also because of its apparent implications for moral motivation .Motivation by moral emotion , if understood in the terms I have suggested , can seem suspiciously self - regarding -- as if the agent 's goal in acting morally were either to improve her state of comfort or discomfort or just to express herself .However , if the content of emotion is a moral evaluation or an evaluation that has moral worth ( such as one that recognizes the value of another person ) , I think this objection can be met , at least for any reasonably broad understanding of moral motivation .One might want to say that emotions themselves can at best just heighten the force of nonemotional reasons : whatever reasons there are for the evaluative content of emotion , or for holding it in mind .But consider how undertaking an obligation by promising or the like typically augments such reasons as already may have been in force for acting in the way that the obligation prescribes .Affect adds a further factor for an agent to take into account , a psychological factor under limited control .Within moral philosophy attention to emotions as subjects of moral judgment has generally emphasized their role as elements of personal moral worth ( see , e.g. , Oakley 1992 ) , on the assumption that their uncontrolled aspect makes them unfit subjects of moral requirement .Indeed , emotions are often invoked in explaining weakness of will .However , insofar as they involve more or less immediate comfort or discomfort , they can serve to modify the payoff structure of the situation prompting weakness of will by reversing temporal discounting ( see Frank 1988 , Greenspan 1988 ; cf .Elster 1999 ) .Their uncontrolled aspect can itself serve as a check against weakness of the sort that involves recalculating one 's reasons when the time for action arrives .Emotion provides a reason for action that is itself somewhat recalcitrant to reason , though subject to indirect control via control over attention .The idea of emotions as factors in practical reasoning might seem to set up a dilemma .On the one hand , if their rational role is analogous to that of belief , then they are reasons only in a subjective sense , not as facts about the world ( including ourselves ) but as purported representations of facts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.7019"}

{"text": "As KCL PhD candidate Nick Prime and I noted , many strategic ends are essentially compromises and products of fractious politics .Second , what it means to fulfill it is always fairly uncertain during the actual process of strategy formulation .Mathematically measured criteria are useful for measuring the distance between intention and goal , but metrics of progress depend on highly subjective definitions of not only the goal but also what it means to realize it .Defining the problem in Vietnam , for example , in terms of eradicating enemy infrastructure in South Vietnam presumes that the most important problem lies in Vietcong \" shadow governments \" that erode power and authority .This is a highly contestable view of the problem , because a combination of targeted killings and the toll of the failed Tet Offensive wiped out enemy infrastructure inside South Vietnam and we still failed to achieve our strategic goals .Computation is likely a very useful model for thinking about strategy , especially ( as Ayoub and Payne do ) from a machine 's point of view .But it should also be observed just how alien this view is from the perspective of classical strategy , and recognized that no model is the territory .As a computer modeler , I never assume that any abstractions I build for coursework are anything but reductions of the \" real \" thing .[ 6 ] As computers become more and more present in strategy and command , we should keep these thoughts and the distinctions they suggest in mind .But is there any middle ground ?One meeting ground between the \" system \" view of strategy and the more humanistic view can be found potentially in the idea of \" control \" expressed by J.C. Wylie and others .Control denotes the utility of strategy being found in the way in which an agent is able to manipulate the key features of the environment in a way that advantages the strategist and disadvantages the opponent .The classical view of computation and behavior in AI and cognitive science has been opposed by another set of views that de - emphasizes elaborate internal representation and emphasizes the way in which interaction with the environment produces intelligent behavior .[ 7 ] .The environment defines a relation between environmental object and an organism that affords the organism with the capability to perform a certain action .Control of the sea , for example , affords certain strategic capabilities that airpower and landpower does not , and vice versa .The simplest way of designing a mobile robot around its environment , for example , would start with basic behaviors ( if X stimulus , perform Y action ) and then utilize more complex control structures to inhibit or favor certain behaviors based on the situation .One behavior might be privileged over another even if they both correspond to the same environmental input .Hence , by changing the nature and pattern of the environment to your advantage , you in term exert control over your opponent .If I am playing hide - and - seek with a TurtleBot , for example , I can thwart my Dalek - like adversary if I re - arrange the topology of my apartment as to frustrate it in numerous ways .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.88376"}

'SALT I was based on a successful identification of such dependencies .The theory of power and politics implicit in Gandhian thought rejects this separation and stresses instead a fundamental continuity between two seemingly opposite entities .The Gandhian strategy of action requires that the protagonist attribute an irreducible minimum humanity to the enemy ; to do otherwise is to betray one 's own humanity .The significance of this premise for reconciliation of conflict and for the process of negotiations can hardly be over - stressed .There is one more possibility of applying the Gandhian technique to the problem of disarmament .This is in mobilizing mass movement against the arms race and building grassroots support for negotiations .The methodology of mass mobilization in this situation , however , would be no different from that of other issues .Critics might argue , and with justification , that peaceful protest would not solve the basic strategic dilemma and might in fact threaten national security by forcing democratic societies to negotiate away their advantages .Against this argument , one may point out that acquisition of arms beyond a certain point is useless , and a peace movement can raise awareness among the masses as well as generate pressures on governments to devote more money to social advancement rather than to defence .This brings us to our question under consideration .Can massive nonviolent resistance be an adequate means of non - nuclear defense ?Several scholars have examined the nonviolent method of defense and concluded that , at least theoretically , it is a plausible alternative , although widespread ignorance and prejudice against it 's methodology have often prevented its being considered seriously .One supporter on nonviolence , Gene Sharp , points out that military power today does not have the real capacity to defend in conflict the people and society relying upon it .Often it only threatens mutual annihilation .He goes on to say that although nonviolent civilian defense will not stop the aggressor at the borders , military aggression does not give the invader political control of the country .He suggests that in civilian defense , military aggression can be resisted by the population as a whole , making it impossible for the enemy to establish and maintain political control .Enemy control can be prevented by massive and selective refusal to cooperate .For instance , police would refuse to locate and arrest patriotic opponents of the invader .Teachers would refuse to introduce this propaganda into the schools , as happened in Norway under the Nazis .Newspapers could refuse to submit to censorship .... as it happened in the Russian 1905 revolution and several Nazi - occupied countries .Gandhi 's solution to external invasion would be to convert the conflict from one at the borders to one against occupation within the country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.89025"}
{"text": "\" The mere mention of September 11 or WTC is the same as reminding Americans of death , \" explains Solomon .University of Arizona psychologist Jeff Greenberg argues that some ideological shifts can be explained by terror management theory ( TMT ) , which holds that heightened fear of death motivates people to defend their world views .TMT predicts that images like the destruction of the World Trade Center should make liberals more liberal and conservatives more conservative . \" In the United States , political conservatism does seem to be the preferred ideology when people are feeling insecure , \" concedes Greenberg .\" Conservatism is a more black and white ideology than liberalism , \" explains Jost .\" It emphasizes tradition and authority , which are reassuring during periods of threat . \"To test the theory , Jost prompted people to think about either pain - by looking at things like an ambulance , a dentist 's chair , and a bee sting - or death , by looking at things like a funeral hearse , the grim reaper , and a dead - end sign .Across the political spectrum , people who had been primed to think about death were more conservative on issues like immigration , affirmative action , and same - sex marriage than those who had merely thought about pain , although the effect size was relatively small .The implication is clear : For liberals , conservatives , and independents alike , thinking about death actually makes people more conservative - at least temporarily .Studies show that people who study abroad become more liberal than those who stay home .People who venture from the strictures of their limited social class are less likely to stereotype and more likely to embrace other cultures .Education goes hand - in - hand with tolerance , and often , the more the better : .Professors at major universities are more liberal than their counterparts at less acclaimed institutions .What travel and education have in common is that they make the differences between people seem less threatening .That 's why the more educated people are , the more liberal they become - but only to a point .Once people begin pursuing certain types of graduate degrees , the curve flattens .Business students , for instance , become more conservative in their views toward minorities .As they become more established , doctors and lawyers tend to protect their economic interests by moving to the right .The findings demonstrate that conservative conversions are fueled not only by fear , but by other factors as well .If we are so suggestible that thoughts of death make us uncomfortable defaming the American flag and cause us to sit farther away from foreigners , is there any way we can overcome our easily manipulated fears and become the informed and rational thinkers democracy demands ?To test this , Solomon and his colleagues prompted two groups to think about death and then give opinions about a pro - American author and an anti - American one .As expected , the group that thought about death was more pro - American than the other .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.91928"}

'In this article , the Gandhian perspective on peace and the applicability of his thesis of nonviolent action to contemporary conflict situations , is examined .Fundamental concepts : 1 .According to Gandhi , the supreme human endeavour should be the pursuit of Satya , Truth .Gandhi often quoted the core philosophical assertion from the Bhagavad Gita , satyanasti paro dharma , ' there is no higher duty than adherence to Truth . 'This was the Upanishadic concept of the ultimate , eternal Truth that is akin to self - realization , transcending barriers of history , time , and culture .However , it was not the eternal Truth that guided Gandhi 's thought and action , but the idea of relative Truth .The basic operative assumption that Gandhi makes is that nonviolence constitutes a positive procedure for promoting worthwhile social change .It is not merely that one should refrain from violence , because it is wrong ; sometimes violence is not wrong .There can be conditions in which one is justified in inflicting violence - for instance , if the only other choice is acting in a cowardly manner .Violence is also justified for the protection of those under one 's care , or under the care of the larger community .In Gandhi 's view , the best response was based on nonviolence ; the second best was violent defense .The worst form of response was submission to a tyrant or running away out of fear of consequences .In Gandhi 's words : I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defer her honour than that she should , in a cowardly manner , become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonour .This , then , brings us to the central idea in his thesis , satyagraha , which literally means ' clinging to truth ' or ' holding fast to truth . 'The notion of satyagraha combines the ideas of truth and nonviolence .As a concept , satyagraha gave expression to Gandhi 's religious and ethical ideas ; as a technique , it put these ideas into practice ; and as a philosophy , it mobilized Hindu philosophical traditions to eliminate contemporary social injustice .Beginning in South Africa , Gandhi launched satyagraha against the laws of the Transvaal government , which required every Indian to procure a certificate of registration or face deportation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.57481"}

{"text": "Embodied metaphors are when , in a way , we take physical concepts from the world that we experience with the body , and use them when we talk about abstract things .For example , there is a recent empirical work to show that metaphors have an embodied spatial basis .We like to think of good things as up , and bad things as down .When we 're feeling good we 're standing tall , perked up , whereas if we 're feeling bad , we might literally be depressed and down .Brian Meier and Michael Robinson , for example , find that when positive things are presented in an up location on a computer screen , people are faster to identify them than when they 're presented in a down location .Similarly when something negative is presented in a down location it 's easier to identify .So there is a sense that we have this spatial connotation of what is good and bad , and that seems to come from our physical orientation , simply how we stand , or how we function in physical space .It all goes back toMetaphors We Live By , by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson .It was all laid out there in the theoretical context of cognitive linguistics , but it was only recently that social psychologists started to empirically test these ideas , and there is now a lot of support for it .So just like embodied factors such as how clean or how disgusted I feel at the moment , how morally good I feel about myself can change my judgments and behaviors .Basically , once I 've affirmed the fact that I 'm a pretty decent person , then that 's it , then I am perfectly content , whereas if I feel inferior on a moral level , then I want to help others , and do good things .Again , it goes back to the idea that even though we think that rational considerations are behind our thoughts and actions , they might in fact be due to factors we 're not even aware of .Morality has really turned into a hot topic within the last few years in psychology .Somehow it really caught on .Why is it that this idea of an intuition - based morality has become so popular ?I think there are a couple of reasons .One reason is that this approach links up well with the approach of embodied cognition , which has become influential at the same time .Another reason is because there is a growing understanding that so many things happen outside of consciousness .We are not aware of many of the things we 're doing , and why we are doing them .So there is a lot of agreement that , often times , we do things for no good reason whatsoever .That means that for better or worse , rational thought may not really happen that often , and it 's not such a central component of human life , or of why we do things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.678154"}

{"text": "So it still represents a fairly conservative move away from judgmentalism on rationality issues -- though it does move beyond the view just distinguished , which makes out emotional appropriateness as dependent on warrant for a corresponding belief .The perspectival account associates emotions with evaluative thoughts rather than strictly judgments in the sense of beliefs ( or acts of forming beliefs ) , but it still allows that the rationality of emotions can be explained in terms of belief warrant .In a more radical departure from judgmentalism , emotions might be thought to be justified rationally by reference to their causal histories rather than some notion of evidence , of the sort that applies to beliefs .In light of the prominence of causal theories in other areas of philosophy , a causal / historical approach to emotions would seem to provide an alternative to judgmentalism and its variants .Some approach along these lines is suggested by recent evolutionary treatments of emotion in philosophy ( e.g. , Gibbard 1991 , Griffiths 1997 ) .However , the only example of it that has been formulated to apply to issues of rationality in the sense indicated is the \" paradigm scenarios \" view in de Sousa ( 1987 ) , which is still phrased in roughly cognitivist terms .The story is what de Sousa calls a \" paradigm scenario , \" meaning that it sets the standard for a particular emotion type , essentially by establishing criteria of appropriateness .Originally , what is involved here is the child 's interaction with caretakers , which serves to modify natural responses by a form of dramatic role - playing ( eliciting or exchanging smiles , say , or conveying empathy ) .Later cultural influences can modify the emotion , though it will remain appropriate in some form as a response to the paradigm scenario .A central example de Sousa wants to defend as appropriate in these terms , in response to some feminist arguments , is jealousy , or jealous rage , with psychoanalytic sources shaped by monogamous culture .On his account the emotion is set up as a response to a situation of \" being robbed by another of vital physical attention \" ( 185 ) .That is how it gets its status and meaning as an intentional response , so it necessarily counts as appropriate on that basis .It is unclear , though , whether the paradigm scenarios account can explain more than the appropriateness of ( at least some central cases of ) a given type of emotion .De Sousa 's essential point about rationality in the sense of appropriateness seems to be just that there can not be an emotion type of which all possible instances are inappropriate .However , it does not follow from this that a given emotion instance should be assessed as appropriate on the basis of its resemblance to the paradigm scenario for its type .More specific rationality questions -- under what circumstances jealousy is appropriate in adult life , say -- remain open .De Sousa speaks of the rationality of emotions in several senses , but overall he seems to be most concerned with rationality in the sense of objectivity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.57202"}

{"text": "So the question is whether we can strategically bring about genuine states of partial uncontrol , individually or collectively .But the answer seems to be that we do this all the time .I would add to Frank 's account the suggestion that we can do it without sacrificing rationality -- even in the short term , to the extent that we undergo an emotion .The point depends on understanding emotions themselves as potentially rational , and as rationalizing action , but also on appreciating features of their role in directing attention that make them subject to manipulation by the agent ( cf .Mele 1995 ) .An effective emotional strategy has to be somewhat indirect : we can not just \" talk ourselves into \" sincere emotional states by commanding ourselves to feel them or by taking immediate aim at the signs of emotion .Instead , we set up the conditions under which they would arise .These include conditions of thought , as ways of understanding the situation .Imagine working up an emotion in order to argue effectively .A case I used in Greenspan ( 2000 ) involves letting oneself get angry about a consumer complaint when the time comes to confront someone at the store .But one might also consider the everyday occasions in teaching or giving a paper when one works up a strategic emotion : indignation at opposing views or enthusiasm for a question that is not of current concern .Some people are better at this than others , needless to say .Part of what it takes is control over attention -- not entertaining those self - defeating thoughts one may well have on hand , of sympathy for the opposing view and disgust at the imperfections of one 's own .Also , it is crucial not to focus too directly on strategy : the aim of generating an emotion in oneself that will enhance performance .To count this restriction of attention as rational in decision - theoretical terms , we have to be clear that rationality does not require being immediately and centrally aware of everything one knows .On standard assumptions in decision theory it does require full knowledge pertaining to the choice situation .But putting blinders on oneself in this sense ( or passively accepting them ) is \" within reason , \" as long as what one knows remains within reach , perhaps on the periphery of attention .A perspectival evaluative account of emotions and emotional rationality can accommodate such maneuvers .We have two competing partial views of the situation -- one focusing on positive features , one on negative -- and some choice about where to focus .So for different purposes we can shift the focus , thereby generating the relevant emotional state -- not with any certainty but with enough probability for the maneuver to count as an exercise of rational control .Since the state involves positive or negative affect ( or possibly a mixture of both ) , we have essentially modified the payoff structure by adding emotion to the preexisting situation .This account is compatible with the usefulness of emotions as commitment devices , which requires that our control over them be incomplete .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.70915"}

{"text": "The closest we come to this need for achievement among the motivational components is that for self - assertion .This need involves , 6 among other things , wanting to increase one 's salary , being first rate in one 's job , excelling colleagues , enjoying making a profit , and wanting to be admired .This is very close to what is meant by the need to achieve , for self - assertion clearly involves a need to improve one 's status in the eyes of others .However , self - assertion is one among many needs and therefore not a central drive nor as evidently important in the personality as McClelland and followers assume .Moreover , there is no common sentiment emerging which subsidiates mainly to this need .Turning to the temperaments , two components share aspects of McClelland 's need for achievement .One is the dominance versus submissiveness component , which was described in the last section .The aggressive , willful , adventurous aspects of this dimension partly refer to the characteristics of a high achievement oriented person .The second component is ego strength versus proneness to neuroticism .7 The high ego strength person is emotionally stable , realistic , mature , calm , and loyal .Moreover , this temperament has been found correlated with a strong motivation for professional status and success as a leader .At the highest level of organization of temperaments , the ego strength and dominance components combine into an anxiety versus integration temperament , 8 where integrated temperaments are those with high ego strength , dominance , and intelligence , among other characteristics .Thus , the need for achievement is mainly reflected in the need for self - assertion and in strong egos and dominating temperaments .22.3 THE NEED FOR STATUS .No one person can be associated with the idea of a need for status , for this idea is implicit in the whole status literature .The belief that all societies are stratified , that all people strive for status , are mobile upwards , try to equilibrate their statuses , and the like , surely implies that within our makeup is a status - oriented motivation .A first question is whether a need for status and a need for achievement are different animals .The precise meaning of a need for achievement is difficult to pin down conceptually in McClelland 's work , but the core seems to comprise a need to do better at what one is doing and to be successful at it in the eyes of others .It is materially and outwardly oriented , and would not include \" achievements \" like being satisfied with one 's position , Buddhist nirvana , Hindu peace , or Confucian inner harmony .Thus , high self - esteem would not necessarily mean high achievement .The literature clearly implies a kind of up - the - ladder syndrome that capitalist entrepreneurs are famous for .Indeed , one has the impression that the need for achievement is precisely that which drives these people .Thus , my previous association of the need for achievement with the need for self - assertion and with strong egos and dominating temperaments is right on the mark .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.85671"}

{"text": "One last reference to the literature on violence will be necessary before beginning my own argument .Hinde ( 1997 ) suggests that we must decouple individual aggression from the causes of war .He argues that aggressive tendencies in soldiers are somewhat irrelevant , because they are , for the most part , only fulfilling social obligations .War , he proposes , is a social institution , so that in order to understand its causes , we need in the first instance to examine social structures , rather than focus on aggressiveness .I think that Hinde 's proposal is valid , in that it adds one more line of study to the many offered by Gilbert ( 1994 ) , as explained before .But I think Hinde overlooks one important way in which individual aggressiveness contributes , on a mass scale , to violence : the way in which the aggressiveness of the leaders of nations is reciprocally linked to the aggressiveness of the publics the leaders serve .I will return to this issue below in my analysis of Hitler 's biographies .Emotional / relational Contributions to Violence .In the 80 's in the U.S. and Europe , psychotherapists became aware that many of their patients had as their main complaint numbness , blankness , and lack of feeling ( Krystal 1988 ; Taylor 1997 ) .This condition has been named alexithymia .It is not clear whether these were new symptoms or that they were noticed more .Although neither Krystal nor Taylor discuss gender , at least three out of four of the cases they mention are men .Especially in Western culture , men are socialized to be alexithymic in varying degrees .Men all over the world have been socialized to be strong , brave and competent , which usually has meant suppressing vulnerable emotions , especially fear , grief , and shame .In most male adults , these emotions are hidden , disguised or suppressed so consistently that early in childhood being aware of them becomes problematic .There is also a substantial literature that men are socialized to pay less attention to attachments to others than women do .To achieve success or at least survival , men are trained to be less interested in affectional bonds than women ( Lewis 1976 ) .Suppression of emotion and detachment from others are closely interrelated .The more one suppresses one 's emotions , the more difficulty others have relating to you .And the more isolated from others , the easier it is to suppress emotions .On one 's own , without having to attend to others , one can try to organize one 's life in a way that avoids emotion .By suppressing emotions and relationships , men become mobile to seek accomplishments and jobs .But such mobility comes at a high price : isolation from self and others , and , as I will argue , a propensity for aggression and violence .Men are socialized to deal with the outer world , but also to mostly ignore the emotional / relational ( e / r ) world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.17312"}

{"text": "Robert Trivers , an influential evolutionary biologist during the 1970 's , suggested that males and females have evolved different degrees of aggression .According to Triver 's theory , female mammals are more invested in the reproductive process than male mammals because female mammals must contribute a relatively large egg , milk and blood to create offspring .Males , however , donate a relatively small amount of seamen .Since females must sacrifice more to produce , they are more likely to favor producing a smaller quantity of high quality offspring .In contrast , males have relatively little invested in each offspring , so producing a large quantity of offspring is favorable to males .Thus , theoretically , females are more selective of mates than males , and males must compete to win mates .Because of this competition , males are thought to be more aggressive than females .( Bartek , 1999 ) .There are clearly no simple genetic or hormonal factors that can explain the variation in aggressive in males and females .Studies of human males suggest that there is at most a small genetic component to aggression , but a greater one for personality traits associated with such behavior .The biological mechanisms translating the message in the genes into antisocial or criminal behavior are not known .Therefore , there is clearly no simple aggressive gene effect .Many genes are likely to be involved , and each may have a weak effect on aggressive behavior .A direct genetic effect on aggression , for example , may determine how quickly an individual responds to aggravation .Aggression may also be influenced indirectly ; for example , a man 's size and strength may affect the way he behaves and how others react to him .( Turner , 253 ) .For males and females , there is substantial evidence for environmental factors effecting aggressive behavior , particularly factors in the home , such as parental attitudes , parental discipline , role models and television violence .The roles we live out each day are connected with the way we think about aggression .It may also be that parents are responsible for these roles by giving the messages they send to their children .\"Parents respond to males and females differently , speaking more often to their daughters , whom they also touch more frequently and treat more delicately .\"For instance , boys are adapted to play with guns , whereas girls are let to play with Sindy and Barby babies when both genders are finding out how the world looks like .Most notably , girls stop behaving aggressively .According to Weiler , since girls feel as if they are behaving like boys when they act aggressively , they seem to decide , \" Girls do n't do this ; I am a girl , so I would better not be aggressive . \"Moreover , after age four , rough , spiky , black or mechanical things are thought to be proper for males , and these kinds of things encourage the aggressive behaviors in males .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.41263"}

{"text": "Whether a given emotion is rationally appropriate depends on whether this corresponding judgment would be warranted as a belief -- whether or not the emotion actually involves that belief .Emotions that do not conform to this model such as empathetic or anticipatory emotions might still sometimes be said to play a limited instrumental role in practical reasoning as cases in which an irrational mental state serves as part of an overall rational strategy .This idea of emotional motivation as \" rational irrationality \" comes up particularly in discussion of evolutionary \" design strategies \" that might account for genetically programmed emotional proclivities underlying human morality ( see Frank 1988 ) .Thus , one could grant that feeling sympathetic sorrow over someone else 's loss would not entail a belief that one has suffered some sort of loss oneself , or warrant for such a belief .But on the present suggestion that is just because it is not really rational in the sense of being appropriate to one 's own situation .The feeling may still be important to sustaining mutually supportive personal relationships , and we can encourage it in ourselves with that end in mind , though to preserve its other - directed quality , we usually try to keep such calculations subliminal , or refer them to evolutionary design .Whether this is a satisfying answer for all cases depends in part on how we think of rationality .We might think of this medium - thick sense as \" representational \" rationality insofar as it depends on assigning emotions intentional content .However , our ordinary notion of emotional appropriateness seems to allow for variable standards of evidence and for more than one option in many cases .For instance , under ordinary circumstances it might be reasonable enough to feel somewhat worried about how a recent medical test will turn out , even in the absence of grounds for real agitation .At the same time , there may be no rational barrier to foregoing any thought about the matter or even feeling hopeful or confident .An emotion might come out as rationally appropriate , on this way of looking at things , even in cases where the corresponding all - things - considered belief would not be warranted .In other words , emotional appropriateness does not seem to be determined by a unitary overall assessment of the available evidence , of the sort presupposed by belief warrant .There is at most one adequately warranted belief ( over the threshold for assent ) about the probability of a bad outcome , relative to the evidence available to the agent .Belief may admit of degrees , but where the evidence is slight , it would be irrational to adopt even a low - grade belief , if that entails adopting conflicting beliefs .However , the emotional analogue ( ambivalent feelings , in some cases even intense feelings ) would seem to be rationally acceptable -- rational in a relatively undemanding sense that allows for options ( Greenspan 1980 ) .We can think of this as \" perspectival \" rationality .Moderate worry and hope in the case just outlined may each be rational from different perspectives -- with reference to different subsets of the available evidence , each worthy of the relevant degree of emotional attention though not requiring it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.72473"}

{"text": "Thank you .Here 's my take on it .This series highlights something very interesting about victims of trauma .There are two ways one can respond to triggers of PTSD .One is aversion , which is the classic response and the one we tend to understand and see portrayed again and again .The other is obsession .Some people will in fact seek out the things that trigger them .If you listen closely , season one Dexter says several different things that indicate blood is a trigger for him , and not something he enjoys .It sets his teeth on edge .He finds the bloodless pieces the ice truck killer leaves behind to be \" beautiful \" .He works a job that is all about finding sense in it , in taking control of it .His reaction to the blood bath Brian set up for him was a full on panic attack .Dexter despises blood , but he is one of those people that needs to re - experience the sense of horror it gives him .I think maybe this , in addition to self control , is the difference between people with terrible pasts who do n't turn into monsters , and the ones that do .Aversion or obsession , either way it 's a failure of society in not helping victims process their trauma properly , and immediately .Dexter is a wounded animal who no one helped doing the best he can in a reality he does n't understand , and I find it completely fascinating .Harry thought he was helping , but maybe the solution was some goddamned therapy .Hi , Mindy .Thank you for your visit and very interesting comment .I also believe that elements of Dexter 's initial trauma act as triggers for the adult and the close relation he has with those stimuli - even if the emotion is not always positive - comes to be one of the most intimate attachments he has .And yes , therapy could have helped the child in expressing the emotions generated by the trauma and would 've probably given him the tools for building better attachments in life .The trauma would still be part of the adult , but coping with those emotions could lead to different social and personal choices .I think that the reason that we like Dexter can be found in the reason that we typically do n't like serial killers and work backwards from there .Most serial killers do n't have a code , they have a profile , which usually includes weaker , vulnerable and isolated victims .Their crimes appear random and meaningless , leaving us with a general feeling of terror .Dexter specifically goes after victims that do harm , or at the very least do n't offend our sensibilities .Its hard to relate to a Ukranian mob boss , a guy that skins people alive or a bunch of people that kill young women and stick their bodies in oil drums .If Dexter 's dark passenger ever let loose and caused him to go after an annoying neighbor or homeless man , then we would see him on the same level as any other killer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.10635"}

{"text": "Abstract .A particular emotional / relational configuration may lead to violence .The relational component is the virtual absence of close bonds to others .It is possible that suppression of vulnerable emotions , acting out anger , and lack of bonds gives rise to the silence / violence pattern : meeting threats to self with either silence or violence .This pattern seems to occur much more frequently in men than in women .Two instances of massive violence illustrate these ideas : the massacre of civilians at My Lai , Vietnam , ordered and assisted by William Calley , and the monstrous violence orchestrated by the Germans under Hitler .The silence / violence pattern may result in violence directly through leaders like Hitler and Calley , and also indirectly , when this pattern is the basis of public support for violent leaders .Boys learn early that showing vulnerable feelings ( grief , fear and shame ) are seen as signs of weakness .First at home , then at school they find that acting out anger , even if faked , is seen as strength .Expressing anger verbally , rather than storming , may be seen as weakness .At first merely to protect themselves , boys begin suppressing feelings that may be interpreted as signs of weakness .In Western cultures most boys learn , as first option , to hide their vulnerable feelings in emotionless talk , withdrawal , or silence .I will call these three responses ( emotional ) SILENCE .In situations where these options seem unavailable , males may cover their vulnerable feelings behind a display of hostility .That is , young boys learn in their families , and later , from their peers , to suppress emotions they actually feel by acting out one emotion , anger , whether they feel it or not .In this latter stage , behavior becomes compulsive .When men face what they construe to be threatening situations , they may be compelled to SILENCE or to rage and aggression .Even without threat , men seem to be more likely to SILENCE or violence than women .With their partners , most men are less likely to talk freely than women about feelings of resentment , humiliation , embarrassment , rejection , joy , genuine pride , loss and anxiety .There was little hard evidence for or against the concepts of repression and the unconscious at this time , and not much more today .By and large , most psychotherapists assumed it to be true , and academic psychologists assumed that it was not true .But his system assumes the repression of painful emotions to the point that they become unconscious in everyday life .Although himself an academic psychologist , he found it necessary to invent terms that would allow his theory of emotions to involve repression and the unconscious emotions that result .My own view of emotions is based largely on my experiences as a teacher , marriage counselor ( 1971 - 76 ) , and my own personal life .For the last thirty - five years of teaching , my classes came close to being forms of group psychotherapy , even the large classes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.01201"}

Bush winning the Southern Baptist Convention 's John Leland Religious Liberty award .The post points out that , given the history of Mr. Leland , awarding it to someone like President Bush is a sick joke .Leland was a firm advocate for separationism , and he actually spoke out against \" toleration \" because he said it did not go far enough : .The liberty I contend for is more than toleration .The very idea of toleration is despicable ; it supposes that some have a pre - eminence above the rest to grant indulgence ; whereas all should be equally free , Jews , Turks , Pagans and Christians .Leland also wrote that \" the fondness of magistrates to foster Christianity has done it more harm than persecutions ever did , \" and maintained suspicion of politicians who wore their faith on their sleeve .In fact , this is somewhat unfair , as it is more the Southern Baptist Church , which broke away from the larger Baptist movement in the mid 19th century ( largely over slavery issues ) that has really been driving for Church / State unification .My impression is that the original Baptists remain reasonably committed to a separationist standpoint .Leland had already died by the time of this schism , but his legacy is most certainly not expressed by the SBC award recipients .David Adnesik is going to read and comment as he works through Alan Dershowitz 's The Case for Israel .The stated point of comparison is to Norman Finkelstein , which seems to give Dershowitz an advantage from the start .I read The Case for Israel a few years back , and thought it was pretty good ( not spectacular ) , however , I was n't really in a stage of my intellectual development where I could cast a truly critical eye on it .Adnesik 's thoughts so far ?Dershowitz wildly overestimates his own abilities , and his use of courtroom stylistic motifs is obnoxious and unhelpful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.98477"}

{"text": "This means that emotional states , or those that are useful as commitment devices , have to exhibit a certain momentum : we can not so easily just talk ourselves out of them , including those we managed to talk ourselves into .In the case of generating enthusiasm to give a paper , momentum ( with any luck ) will be a product of the rewarding aspect of the feeling , as augmented by others ' positive responses .This case is in some ways easier in that it involves inducing dispositions to feel certain emotions rather than occurrent emotions .The notion of cultivating certain traits in ourselves , including emotional dispositions , is familiar from Aristotle 's account of habituation in virtue ( see 1925 ) and still plays a role in philosophers ' views of emotional motivation ( see , e.g. , Wollheim 1991 ) .However , most recent approaches to emotion focus on occurrent states , perhaps in reaction to an earlier overemphasis on dispositions in philosophical behaviorism ( see Ryle 1949 ) .Damasio 's point about \" marking \" thoughts with emotion covers some cases of emotional self - commitment .Consider learning a foreign language : one way of implanting information in long - term memory is to focus emotional attention on it -- perhaps by thinking of some association that evokes amusement .By inducing an occurrent emotion , I would say , we give ourselves a further reason for action -- much as we do when we make a promise to others .However , this rational role of emotions may seem hard to accommodate within the traditional division of views within modern moral philosophy .On the one hand , though it carries echoes of Kantian notion of making law for oneself , it runs very much against the usual picture of Kant 's emotionless notion of practical reason ( see esp .Kant 1981 : 399 ; but cf .Sherman 1990 ) .On the other hand , while the contrasting Humean picture accords emotions a necessary practical role , this seems to depend on undermining the role of practical reason .However , here as elsewhere an alternative model is provided by Aristotle ( see 1925 ) .Among other things , Aristotelian ethics suggests a picture of practical reasoning that includes not just the calculation of means to ends but also the determination of constituents of valued wholes .Aristotle had in mind happiness , of course , but one might fill in something shorter - term for particular emotions .Action expressive of an emotion has a certain value for the agent as the completion of a more integrated psychological whole : a fit between inner and outer states of oneself , as the original condition from which adult reactions developed .For that matter , action on emotion counts as an instance of value - expressive behavior to the extent that emotions amount to felt evaluations : they have evaluative thought contents as well as amounting to affective states assessable from the standpoint of the agent .So there are two layers of evaluation that we can appeal to here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.43158"}

{"text": "The numbers are really stunning .According to a recent report by the investment firm Lazard , the cost of electricity generation using wind power fell 61 percent from 2009 to 2015 , while the cost of solar power fell 82 percent .These numbers - which are in line with other estimates - show progress at rates we normally only expect to see for information technology .And they put the cost of renewable energy into a range where it 's competitive with fossil fuels .Now , there are still some issues special to renewables , in particular problems of intermittency : consumers may want power when the wind does n't blow and the sun does n't shine .But this issue seems to be of diminishing significance , partly thanks to improving storage technology , partly thanks to the realization that \" demand response \" - paying consumers to cut energy use during peak periods - can greatly reduce the problem .So what will it take to achieve a large - scale shift from fossil fuels to renewables , a shift to sun and wind instead of fire ?Financial incentives , and they do n't have to be all that huge .Tax credits for renewables that were part of the Obama stimulus plan , and were extended under the recent budget deal , have already done a lot to accelerate the energy revolution .The Environmental Protection Agency 's Clean Power Plan , which if implemented will create strong incentives to move away from coal , will do much more .And none of this will require new legislation ; we can have an energy revolution even if the crazies retain control of the House .Now , skeptics may point out that even if all these good things happen , they wo n't be enough on their own to save the planet .For one thing , we 're only talking about electricity generation , which is a big part of the climate change problem but not the whole thing .For another , we 're only talking about one country when the problem is global .But I 'd argue that the kind of progress now within reach could produce a tipping point , in the right direction .Once renewable energy becomes an obvious success and , yes , a powerful interest group , anti - environmentalism will start to lose its political grip .And an energy revolution in America would let us take the lead in global action .Salvation from climate catastrophe is , in short , something we can realistically hope to see happen , with no political miracle necessary .But failure is also a very real possibility .Everything is hanging in the balance .There were four posts yesterday .The first was \" The Anti - Fed Two - Step : \" .Back when Ted Cruz first floated his claim that the Fed caused the Great Recession - and some neo - monetarists spoke up in support - I noted that this was a repeat of the old Milton Friedman two - step .First , you declare that the Fed could have prevented a disaster - the Great Depression in Friedman 's case , the Great Recession this time around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.55149"}
{"text": "Through innumerable indications , we are taught that men and women are different .In everyday life , it is commonly assumed that men are more aggressive than women .Statistics indicate that males are more likely than females to commit such crimes as murder , armed robbery , and aggravated assault which are the result of feeling aggressive .In addition men describe themselves as being aggressive to a greater extent than do women and show greater potential for acting aggressively .All of these assumptions lead us to a certain question : Why are human males more aggressive than females ?Actually , there are two significant factors which determine this distinctiveness , these are , biological and environmental factors .Both of them are strong evidences .However , the question is which of them has more influence on aggression that the other one .Research in the past on aggression was performed under the hypothesis was that women rarely display aggression ; therefore , aggressive behavior was viewed as a male phenomenon .Recent research has challenged the gender bias in the existence of aggressive behaviors and has broadened the definition of aggression .According to this definition , aggression is any behavior that is intended to inflict harm ( physical and /or psychological ) on another human ( Geen , 11 ) .As we see , in this definition , aggression is applied to all humans without separating women from men .There are several explanations for aggressive behaviors of males and females .Biologists argue that testosterone , the male androgen , is the key factor of aggression in males .Some psychologists blame the ways parents behave towards their children in a double standard about the acceptability of aggression .Other theorists identify male and female adult roles : the tendency for men 's participation in competitive sports , the military , and the cut- throat world of business actually encourage the use of aggression in males .In contrast , women 's traditional roles as homemakers or as lower - status employees systematically deter the expression of aggression .These theories may explain why women are less aggressive than men .Many studies have investigated possible links between different degrees of aggression in men and women and biological factors .The studies have indicated that , across cultures , males are generally more assertive , less inhibited in expressing anger and more likely to use physical aggression than females .( Archer , 233 ) Genetic and hormonal factors have been suggested as possible causes of this difference in aggressive behavior between the two sexes .Males , for example normally possess one Y chromosome and one X chromosome in contrast to the two X chromosomes of women , and they have higher plasma levels of the sex hormone testosterone .( Archer , 240 ) High levels of testosterone are associated with increased aggression , but the relationship is complex , since testosterone levels interact with the environment .Testosterone increases aggression only under conditions of competition , and positive associations between testosterone and aggression are affected by other people in the individuals ' environment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.80487"}

{"text": "Indeed , the adaptation of one narrative necessarily involves the suppression of others .This is problematic , because the undeniably pluralism of reality makes it more than likely that even suppressed narratives contain grains of truth inside of them , and their marginalization thus operates as a cognitive shortcut to simplify ( but distort ) our perception of the world .Yet it is unavoidable -- it is impossible to function while simultaneously affirming every possible narrative existent in the wide world .I think this offers an important qualifier to discussions on the Israeli / Palestinian conflict .There are many narratives clashing here : Jewish restoration of homeland versus Palestinian naqba , Binational versus unitary states , terrorism or resistance .People adopt a favored narrative and then interpret events through that lens .So , in the comments to the last post we discussed the shooting death of a young Palestinian teenager by the IDF .As usual , there are conflicting stories as to what happened -- the IDF says he was trying to cut through the security barrier , his friends and family say he was riding a horse near the barrier but was not attempting to cross it .Whom one believes is largely a function of how one more broadly conceptualizes the narrative of the Israeli / Palestinian conflict .My internal narrative frame emphasizes anti - Jewish oppression , of which Israel is supposed to be a haven from .In this context , Palestinian attacks on Israel is simple a localized version of a global trend .Israel 's actions are understood in the context of preventing another Auschwitz -- never again will we meekly march to our own graves .And Israel , for its part , qualifies its behavior based on Jewish experience and ethics , which desire to minimize civilian casualties and have an ultimate desire to live in harmony with its neighbors .Civilians still die , of course , but these are seen as mistakes , tragedies , or products of Palestinian terror groups basing their operations within civilian populations .Of course , even within this narrative , it is quite obvious that in any given case ( or in this case ) the Palestinian teenagers and their families may be telling the truth .All armies contain brutes who like inflict suffering , and the hierarchal nature of occupation make exploitation easy to cause and easier to cover up .But since I have no way to independently verify what happened in any particular case , I mentally categorize the events as what they are \" most likely , \" which is accordance with the dominant narrative .The net effect is suppress instances of illegitimate Palestinian suffering that I theoretically \" know \" happen but never actually grapple with because I can derail their entry into my consciousness at the level of the particular event .My narrative also obliterates ( i.e. , refuses to recognize the legitimacy of ) still other counter - narratives , ones that might challenge whether Israel legitimately exists at all , or whether it has any particular ties to ethical behavior constraining its action .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.433105"}

{"text": "While this matter is mostly political theater , it does raise some matters of philosophical interest .One interesting point is that the proposal to ban Trump appears to be consistent with the principles that seem to lurk behind the obscuring fog of Trump 's various proposals and assertions .One obvious concern is that attributing principles to Trump is challenging - he is a master of being vague and is not much for providing foundations for his proposed policies .Trump has , however , focused a great deal on the borders of the United States .He has made the comically absurd proposal to build a wall between the United States and Mexico and , as noted above , proposed a ban on all Muslims entering the United States .This seems to suggest that Trump accepts the principle that a nation has the right to control its borders and to keep out anyone that is deemed a threat or undesirable by the state .This principle , which might be one that Trump accepts , is certainly a reasonable one in general terms .While thinkers disagree about the proper functions of the state , there is general consensus that a state must , at a minimum , provide basic defense and police functions and these include maintaining borders .This principle would certainly warrant the UK from banning Trump .Even if the is specific general principle is not one Trump accepts , he certainly seems to accept that a state can ban people from entering that state .As such , consistency would require that Trump accept that the UK has every right to ban him .Trump , if he were inclined to argue rationally , could contend that there are relevant differences between himself and those he proposes to ban .He could , for example , argue that the proposed wall between the United States and Mexico is to keep out illegals and point out that he would enter the UK legally rather than sneaking across the border .In regards to the proposed ban on all Muslims , Trump could point out that he is for banning Muslims but not for banning non - Muslims .As such , his principle of banning Muslims could not be applied to him .A way to counter this is to focus again on the general principle that might be behind Trump 's proposals , namely the principle of excluding people who are regarded as a threat or at least undesirable .While Trump is not likely to engage in acts of terror in the UK , his behavior in the United States does raise concerns about his ideology and he could justly be regarded as a threat to the UK .He could , perhaps , radicalize some of the population .As such , Trump could be justly banned on the basis of a possible principle he is employing to justify his proposed bans ( assuming that there are some principles lurking back there somewhere ) .Trump could , of course , simply call the UK a bunch of losers and insist that they have no right to ban him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.890175"}

{"text": "Here , what is almost uniformly meant is a striving for high rank on those dimensions valued in our reference group , which may be ruthlessness for gang members , piousness for monks , respect for judges , wealth for businessmen , and power for politicians .Whatever the particulars , which vary from group to group and society to society , in general the drive for status means striving to improve our power , wealth , or prestige .It is , in effect , an outward concern with the ranking that we have in our reference group , and thus is not a matter of inner respect , harmony , and self - esteem .The need for achievement , however , is a drive to do better in the outer world , even if at the cost of the respect of one 's reference group .While the drive for status is a striving along those dimensions one 's peers most value , the drive for achievement is to do materially or practically the best one can .Thus , a pious Catholic peasant may be striving for a status ( prestige ) among his friends based on his great piety , but in a material or practical sense , he may have achieved little and may be the least successful farmer in the church .Moreover , self - sentiment has some status attributes , such as preserving one 's social reputation , and the self - esteem goal in part depends on doing what is socially acceptable ( loss of face plays a role here ) .In its status aspects , then , the self - sentiment subsidiates to the self - assertive need : status motivationally is directly reflected in the self - assertive need and partly in the goal of self - esteem .In addition , striving for status shows some relationship to a surgent temperament , 11 which comprises being cheerful , sociable , energetic , and talkative .This is understandable , since the way to status is eased by having just such characteristics .In brief , a need for status is similar but distinct from an assumed need for achievement and is identical with the self - assertive need , related to the self - sentiment , high ego strength , surgency , and a dominating temperament .22.4THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY .The notion of an authoritarian personality has gained some research respectability 12 and especially has influenced behavior - oriented political scientists .Indeed , to be a respectable American political scientist means to be antiauthoritarian .The idea of an authoritarian personality based on behavioral research , thus clearly showing that no one really could be authoritarian by choice , is attractive .What is the evidence for such a personality in the multivariate personality research ?Clearly , what is meant by authoritarian is not a motivation or ability , but a temperament , an orientation , a style .No simple unitary authoritarian style emerges from the research .Rather , we find a componentially complex , multifold personality , and even among the separate components an authoritarian does not emerge .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.43871"}

'Her stories set in the Subcontinent , like \" The Treatment of Bibi Haldar , \" show how superstitious and narrow - minded such societies can be regarding illness and the need for marriage .The women in \" This Blessed House \" and \" A Temporary Affair , \" by contrast , seem liberated by their lives in America .These stories explore the psychological and spiritual fissures opened up by the cultural dissonance of our modern age , and , as such , should strike a chord with anyone dissatisfied with the complexity and shallowness of out modern lives .The ultimate value of these stories is that they offer a subtle critique of globalization .There was a problem filtering reviews right now .Please try again later .I loved reading Jhumpa Lahiri 's ' Interpreter of Maladies ' .Being an Indian myself , I 'm tired of reading books that package India 's ' exoticism ' to the West .Jhumpa Lahiri 's stories do not revolve around the \" Indianness \" of the characters .India is always in the background , but the characters and their emotions are simply human .In the ' Interpreter of Maladies ' , Ms. Lahiri 's breathtakingly beautiful , yet simple style of storytelling tells you a story about people who just happen to be Indian .The narrative she employs is very humane , with a lot of attention to detail .The stories are strong and delicate at the same time .I particularly enjoyed the title story ' Interpreter of Maladies ' and the last story ' The Third and Final continent ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.81082"}

{"text": "Or perhaps there are other alternatives .One possibility is to consider the power of cognitive dissonance management - a person could know that a cherished belief is not true , yet refuse to reject the belief while being fully aware that this is a problem .I will explore this possibility in the context of comfort beliefs in a later essay .Another possibility is to consider that the term \" knowledge \" is not being used in the strict philosophical sense of a justified true belief .Rather , it could be taken to refer to strongly believing that something is true - even when it is not .For example , a person might say \" I know I turned off the stove \" when , in fact , they did not .As another example , a person might say \" I knew she loved me , but I was wrong .\" What they mean is that they really believed she loved him , but that belief was false .Using this weaker account of knowledge , then a person can believe in something that they know is not true .This just involves believing in something that one also strongly believes is not true .In some cases , this is quite rational .For example , when I roll a twenty sided die , I strongly believe that a will not roll a 20 .However , I do also believe that I will roll a 20 and my belief has a 5 % chance of being true .As such , I can believe what I know is not true - assuming that this means that I can believe in something that I believe is less likely than another belief .People are also strongly influenced by emotional and other factors that are not based in a rational assessment .In the previous essay on threat assessment I looked at the influence of availability heuristics and fallacies that directly relate to errors in reasoning about statistics and probability .This essay continues the discussion by exploring the influence of fear and anger on threat assessment .As noted in the previous essay , a rational assessment of a threat involves properly considering how likely it is that a threat will occur and , if it occurs , how severe the consequences might be .As might be suspected , the influence of fear and anger can cause people to engage in poor threat assessment that overestimates the likelihood of a threat or the severity of the threat .One common starting point for anger and fear is the stereotype .Roughly put , a stereotype is an uncritical generalization about a group .While stereotypes are generally thought of as being negative ( that is , attributing undesirable traits such as laziness or greed ) , there are also positive stereotypes .They are not positive in that the stereotyping itself is good .Rather , the positive stereotype attributes desirable qualities , such as being good at math or skilled at making money .While it makes sense to think that stereotypes that provide a foundation for fear would be negative , they often include a mix of negative and positive qualities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.44027"}

' ' [ McCorkle and Korn 1958 ] ( Cloward , et al , 1960 ) .Although shame is not explicitly mentioned in these studies , they imply a shame / anger dynamic .Rather than acknowledge the shame of rejection , the prisoners mask it with anger and hostility , much like the \" lads \" in Willis 's study react to their teachers .Class analysis is not an explicit feature of the prison studies , but they assume that almost all of the prisoners are working class rather than middle class .To the extent that is the case , there is a second parallel with Willis 's study of working class boys .If high school boys , working class men , offenders in prisons and patients in a mental hospital repress shame , then there must be something more to the creation of violence , as Gilligan suggests .There is clear evidence of the repression of shame in these men , but only a few of them perpetrate violent acts .Elaborating the Conditions for Violence .It seems to me that Gilligan 's second and third condition need to be considered further , as I have already done with his first condition , secrecy .His second condition , that one has run out of alternatives to violence , is called entrapment in the literature on the conditions for conflict ( E.g. , Brockner and Rubin 1985 ) .It may be based , at least in part , on reality , as is the case with those who occupy low status in ghettoes .Or it may be mostly illusory , as it sometimes is with upper class perpetrators .One issue that needs further exploration is the possibility that both Gilligan 's second and third conditions are so closely related to unacknowledged shame that they are facets rather than independent dimensions .Fluster and disruption of perception and thought is a key feature of shame and embarrassment states , whether acknowledged or not .The feeling of entrapment , in some cases , might be entirely due to shame states .Similarly , the absence of feelings of love , guilt , or fear might also be traced to the shame process .As already indicated , most men are socialized to be ashamed of feeling , especially fear , but also feelings of tenderness , love and affection .The third emotion mentioned by Gilligan , guilt , is itself a shame derivative , compounded of shame and anger , with the anger directed inward .As indicated above , many men experience grief , fear and shame as blankness or obsession rather than emotions .Like feelings of entrapment , the absence of love , guilt and fear might be facets of the complete repression of shame .If that is the case , then the question of further conditions for the development of violence out of shame states might be an issue of the degree to which shame states are completely inaccessible .Perhaps violence is generated out of unacknowledged shame only in the most extreme cases of repression .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.509384"}

{"text": "However , the treaties do not forbid private ownership in space - as such , any other nation could pass a similar law that allows its citizens to own property in space without violating the laws of that nation .One obvious concern is that if multiple nations pass such laws and citizens from these nations start mining asteroids , then there will be the very real possibility of conflict over valuable resources .In some ways this will be a repeat of the past : the more technological advanced nations engaged in a struggle to acquire resources in an area where they lack sovereignty .These past conflicts tended to escalate into actual wars , which is something that must be considered in the final frontier .One way to try to avoid war over asteroid resources is to work out new treaties governing the use of space resources .This is , obviously enough , a matter that will be handled by space lawyers , governments , and corporations .Unless , of course , the automated killing machines resolve it first .While the legal aspects of space ownership are interesting , the moral aspects of ownership in space are also of considerable concern .While it might be believed that property rights in space is something entirely new , this is clearly not the case .While the location is clearly different than in the original , the matter of space property matches the state of nature scenarios envisioned by thinkers like Hobbes and Locke .To be specific , there is an abundance of resources and an absence of authority .As it now stands , while no one can hear you scream in space , there is also no one who can arrest you for space thievery .Using the state of nature model , it can be claimed that there are currently no rightful owners of the asteroids or it could be claimed that we are all the rightful owners ( the asteroids are the common property of all of humanity ) .If there are currently no rightful owners , then it would seem that the asteroids are there for the taking : an asteroid belongs to whoever can take and hold it .This is on par with Hobbes ' state of nature - practical ownership is a matter of possession .As Hobbes saw it , everyone has the right to all things , but this is effectively a right to nothing - other than what a person can defend from others .As Hobbes noted , in such a scenario profit is the measure of right and who is right is to be settled by the sword .While this is practical , brutal and realistic , it does seem a bit morally problematic in that it would , as Hobbes also noted , lead to war .His solution , which would presumably work as well in space as on earth , would be to have sovereignty in space .This would shift the war of all against all in space ( of the sort that is common in science fiction about asteroid mining ) to a war of nations in space ( which is also common in science fiction ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.075806"}

{"text": "Gottschalk and his associates have found that a five - minute speech sample yields sufficient information to allow the measurement of cues to emotion and other indicators ( many studies are summarized in Gottschalk 1995 ) .To test the theory proposed here , a first step would be record brief life histories from violent and non - violent men and women convicted of crimes .For the violent group , emphasis might be placed on the recounting of the circumstances of the aggressive or violent act that led to their imprisonment .For the non - violent group , for sake of comparison , emphasis could be place on the recounting of their most aggressive or violent act , even though it was not the cause of imprisonment .Such a study might disentangle the correlation between violence and gender .According to the argument of this article , we would expect to find the men much more isolated from affectional attachments than the women ( Condition 1 ) .Also hypothesized is an equally high level of shame cues in the discourse of the men and women , but much higher anger cues in men .That is , it is hypothesized than when men fail to acknowledge shame , they are more likely than women to take the path of shame , anger and aggression ( Condition 2 ) .Since the anger response serves to bypass shame , we would expect more obsessive preoccupation in men than women ( 3 ) .Women , on the other hand , are more likely than men to take the path of overt , undifferentiated shame , silence , and withdrawal , and therefore less likely to respond with obsession , anger and aggression .Conclusion .Goethe had the protagonist of his play ( Tasso ) say that he thanked God that he had given him the ability to speak his suffering , when other men would be struck dumb with it .As men discover their emotional / relational world , they will no longer have to face the choice between blankness or violence .References .Brockner , J. , and J.

{"text": "Toomey has already won the backing of a few soft Democratic fundraisers as a direct result of that , and he leads the early polls .Even so , if he wins , it will be a close race , not a blowout .Toomey will not have an easy or comfortable victory - the recent Democratic sweep in the state Supreme Court races underscores the grassroots power of the state 's unions .Think of Rick Santorum 's successful re - election in 2000 as a model .One major reason Toomey is looking strong is that Democrats lost their strongest potential candidate - Attorney General Kathleen Kane - to a major scandal that has resulted in her disbarment and could soon see her turned out of office .As a result , they have a competitive primary that pits Toomey 's 2010 opponent , former Rep. Joe Sestak , D , against Katie McGinty , who ran for governor in 2014 and got less than 8 percent in the Democratic primary .Having gone on to become chief of staff to Gov. Tom Wolf , McGinty now has the backing of the party establishment .Many Democrats never forgave Sestak for challenging and defeating the party - switching Sen. Arlen Specter in 2010 .Wisconsin : In 2010 , Ron Johnson came out of nowhere to defeat Sen. Russ Feingold , D , a hero of progressives .Feingold ultimately became the victim of Johnson 's personal funding of his race and a national mood very hostile toward Obama and Obamacare .This year 's race features a rematch .And this time around , the national mood that put Johnson over the top in 2010 has n't developed - at least not yet .Johnson trails by large margins in every recent poll .Given presidential turnout , it may not be enough to spend and organize well once again - Johnson might be unable to win without some major national problem for Democrats .Examples : A massive breakdown in Obamacare , continued Obama failure against ISIS combined with more terrorist attacks ; or perhaps something that can not be foreseen at this point .Johnson remains the most vulnerable incumbent senator of either party .Feingold is the early favorite to reclaim the seat .President 2016 .The primaries are rapidly approaching , and Donald Trump continues to defy gravity , holding a substantial lead in national polling .Although his grip on media attention is not quite as solid as it was before , it has not died off , nor have his leads in the various polls .But do n't panic .There is a good reason why people are still discussing Trump - whether he is a fascist , for example , and what exactly he meant by his wild , extremely Trumpy comments about this and that and the other thing .This all comes with the territory of being the frontrunner .Trump has a hard core of support that will not be deterred by day - to - day controversies or by whether anything he asserts is true .What he has yet to prove is whether he can attract additional support .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.70529"}
{"text": "This amounts to an emotion - based version of the metaethical question of the objectivity of values , since the properties in question , corresponding to different types of emotion , are \" axiological \" or value properties .However , recent views within the metaethical literature would seem to allow for emotional rationality in a sense independent of objectivism about values ( see , e.g. , Gibbard 1990 , Blackburn 1998 ; cf .Greenspan 1995 and 1998 , D'Arms and Jacobson 2000 ) .But some emotional responses that are normal and understandable might be inappropriate .So even the received paradigm of an emotion can be skewed or off the mark .Applying the paradigm scenarios approach to cases would seem to involve appeal to an interpretation of the situation that might be summed up in a proposition : that one has been robbed of vital physical attention , in the jealousy example .De Sousa rejects the analogy between emotions and beliefs as a basis for his approach to rationality issues at least partly because he understands rational beliefs as arrived at in a certain way , on the basis of reasoning ( see 5 ; cf .197f . )However , this is not part of the belief - based approach as here intended .It is not clear how the paradigm scenarios view could handle cases without appeal to belief - based criteria of rationality .For example , imagine someone who momentarily feels jealous anger when his wife exchanges glances with another male at a party .A variant of the general causal - historical approach that rejects reference to propositional attitudes is the evolutionary account in Griffiths ( 1997 ) .Though Griffiths is mainly concerned with the question of the nature of emotions rather than rationality issues , his argument turns out to rest at crucial points on a familiar way of setting up emotions in opposition to reason .Those cases in which emotions appear to be used strategically can not be genuine emotions on his account .Griffiths particularly has in mind emotions based on the social pretense that we lack rational control over a certain pattern of behavior .He draws on anthropological examples from defenders of \" social constructivist \" views of emotions ( see , e.g. , Averill 1980 , Lutz 1986 ) in which the conditions of particular syndromes of emotions seem to be based on social conventions .A parallel from contemporary urban life is the \" Rambo \" syndrome of violent male rage ; some conceptions of romantic love might also qualify .However , Griffiths ' point is that whatever is felt in such cases would be disqualified from inclusion in a class of genuine emotions .However , it seems , on the contrary , that we can make sense of a self - fulfilling social pretense of emotion in the example of male jealousy drawn from de Sousa .However , we need a less extreme version of the view to modify the usual picture of rationality and emotions .The rational role of emotions depends on the fact that our control over them is limited .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.7213"}

G. Jung , Psychological Types , 380 . )The impetus for their thinking comes , as Jung says , from \" the subjective factor , \" from their need to know about what lies outside themselves , as well as from their anxiety when they do not understand the environment .This is why thinking is the method Fives use both to fit into the world and , paradoxically , to defend themselves against it .One of the results of the way Fives think is that even healthy Fives are not very deeply rooted in visceral experience .They are the type of people who get a great deal of intellectual mileage out of very little experience because they always find something of significance where others see little or nothing .This may lead to great discoveries .However , when they stop observing the world and focus their attention on their interpretations of it , Fives begin to lose touch with reality .Instead of keeping an open mind while they observe the world , they become too involved with their own thoughts and dreams .This leads them further away from the world of constructive action - the very arena in which their self - confidence needs to develop .They may spend a great deal of time playing around with ideas or visions of reality which have almost no practical impact on their lives , leaving them more fearful about themselves and feeling more vulnerable to the predations of the world .Parental Orientation As a result of their formative experiences , these children became ambivalent to both parents .Fives , like Twos and Eights , were in search of a niche within the family system , a role that they could fulfill that would win them protection and nurturance .For whatever reasons , though , they perceived that there was no place for them to fit in - that nothing they could do was wanted or needed by their family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.50441"}
{"text": "It evaluates something as good or bad , desirable or worth avoiding -- or simply as an object of a current desire or aversion .For instance , fear may be said to represent its object ( what one is fearful of or about ; a certain event , or a likely cause of it ) as a threat , a possible harm .Anger represents its object ( another person , or his performance of some action ) as already a cause of harm or offense that now calls for retaliation .Emotions also involve a corresponding affective element , derived from pleasure or pain on Aristotle 's account of emotions ( see 1941 ) , that amounts to a good or bad state of the agent and hence supplies a reinforcing reason for action ( Greenspan 1988 ) .In contemporary decision - theoretical terms , the affective element modifies the \" payoff structure \" of the situation : the array of potential costs and benefits of alternative responses open to the agent .The discomfort experienced in fear or anger , for instance , provides the agent with a further ( pro tanto ) reason for acting to change the situation that provokes discomfort .On the other hand , joy or pride , as positive evaluations of some state of affairs or of oneself , do not provide a reason to change anything , but their affective aspect yields a further reason to sustain the conditions that make the evaluation appropriate .However , the focus of the agent 's attention in all these cases is normally the evaluative content of emotion , not her own state of feeling .Apart from its role as a source of reinforcing reasons , the affective or feeling aspect of emotion is useful to practical reasoning just insofar as it serves to hold in mind the evaluative content of emotion without explicit reflection .For instance , while driving on the highway one does not have to deliberate at length about possible bad consequences of swerving and their relevance to the task of steering straight .To the extent that steering straight is not just automatic , and the driver wanders out of lane , an anxious awareness of the possibility of an accident brings her quickly back to the task .This way of anticipating practical eventualities in everyday life corresponds roughly to neuroanatomist Antonio Damasio 's ( 1994 ) understanding of emotions as \" somatic markers .\" Damasio 's view is put forth to explain why cases of emotional impairment due to brain lesion ( such as the famous nineteenth - century case of Phineas Gage ) involve a loss of practical reasoning ability .Emotions serve to \" mark \" practically significant thoughts with bodily ( and hence affective ) indicators of past experience .On an evaluative account , characteristic thoughts have come to be contents of emotion -- and part of what identifies them as the types of emotion they are : fear , anger , joy , pride , and so forth .A question for philosophers who accept an evaluative account is whether and in what sense emotions themselves are subject to rational assessment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.624664"}

'He defends his position : If it is said that those optimistic speculations are absurd , I must insist that they are soundly based on the logic of deterrence .If the risks that deterrent policies involve must continue to increase , the use of armed force in the international sphere must become progressively more dangerous and hence it must eventually become too hazardous to use in the most extreme national emergencies .Unfortunately , the logic of deterrence does not quite work in the way Horsburg describes .Nuclear states often engage in conventional wars and by a tacit agreement refrain from using their most lethal weapons .For instance , in the conflict over the Falkland Islands between England and Argentina , England certainly had the capacity to wage a nuclear war .Similarly , in the 1979 conflict between China and Vietnam , China had an independent nuclear capacity and Vietnam was under the Soviet nuclear umbrella .Indeed , one might point out that the rough parity in nuclear weapons has aggravated the competition for the Third World between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. .If satyagraha is impractical in a situation of nuclear war , does it have any relevance in negotiations for nuclear disarmament ?In other words , can it act as a preventive ?Can the Gandhian principles of steps and stages , sympathetic understanding for one 's adversary , formulation of minimal demands consistent with truth , refusal to threaten or intimidate the enemy , and open diplomacy be meaningfully applied to fashion a strategy for gradual nuclear disarmament ?In principle , the Gandhian framework can be an important guide for negotiations on disarmament .Indeed , even conventional diplomacy recognizes the need for confidence building measures and reciprocity .Nor can negotiations be successful unless both sides are convinced of the sincerity of their opponents .However , today such settlements are seldom arrived at by open diplomacy or via adherence to the idea that mutual demands should be consistent with truth .More often than not , open diplomacy is used to score points with critics at home , to pressure the adversary , or worse still , to camouflage reluctance to negotiate .The usual practice in arms negotiations is to demand the maximum , in the hope that the final agreement will ensure more than what is required for defense .It is difficult to imagine a situation in which a nuclear power would unilaterally disarm without an effective substitute strategically equivalent to armed strength .There are , however , elements in satyagraha that have an important bearing on the question of how to engage constructively in bargaining for disarmament .Let us look at some of the causes of the arms race between superpowers .According to several scholars , the arms race is a result of certain attitudes common to both the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.Each country has dehumanized the other , discounting the fears and concerns of the other 's population and characterizing the other 's leaders as war mongers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.47049"}

{"text": "Hume 's famous denial ( see 1978 ) that the passions can be rationally assessed at all was based on his interpretation of them as nonrepresentational .But contemporary evaluative accounts interpret emotions , in effect , as representing evaluative propositions : that something portends harm or deserves retaliation or is a stroke of good luck or praiseworthy .The evaluative implications of emotion have been characterized thus far without commitment to a particular contender for capturing their essential nature .This is the philosopher 's usual first question , and it was set up as the focus of contemporary debate on emotion by James ( 1884 ) .However , as Rorty ( 1980 ) and others have noted ( cf .Griffiths 1997 ) , emotions do not form a natural class .A later approach ( de Sousa 1987 , Greenspan 1988 ) begins with questions of rationality , treating cases of rational emotional response as paradigmatic .Emotions in lower animals or infants ( along with some elements of our own experience that derive from them unchanged ) can be understood from this standpoint as deficient instances of full - blown emotions functioning normally in adult human life .As applied to accounts of the nature of emotions , the evaluative approach is often discussed under the heading of \" cognitivism , \" which interprets emotions themselves as amounting to or containing cognitions , usually seen as mental states representing evaluative propositions .The most straightforward version of the cognitivist view is \" judgmentalism , \" which understands the nature of emotions in terms of judgments : assertive propositional attitudes , assessable by the ordinary evidential standards applied to beliefs .The view traces back to the Stoics ( see Nussbaum 1993 ) , though the Stoics interpreted our ordinary emotions as \" confused \" rather than rational judgments .The contemporary version of judgmentalism was introduced into the Anglo - American philosophical literature by Bedford ( 1957 ) , in a post - Wittgensteinian response to the Cartesian tradition of identifying emotions with particular passions or feelings , as in Hume ( cf .Descartes 1970 , James 1884 ) .Davidson ( 1980 ) defends a version of judgmentalism for pride and related emotions .Proponents of judgmentalist accounts do not always seem to have the same thing in mind by \" judgment . \"However , there are also many morally or motivationally important emotions that one might be inclined to assess as rational but that turn on imagining some state of affairs that is not applicable ( at least in current terms ) to oneself .Cases of empathetic emotion , for instance , seem to involve putting oneself in the position of another person , typically someone suffering harm .However , acting effectively out of sorrow felt on behalf of someone else often depends on not losing sight of the fact that one is not really in the same position oneself .Similarly for anticipatory emotions such as guilt at the thought of something one might ( or might not ) do .One might distinguish a possible variant of judgmentalism meant to apply specifically to rationality issues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.418015"}

{"text": "It is hundreds , and perhaps thousands of years old .G. I. Gurdjieff , a philosopher and metaphysical teacher , spoke of the Enneagram as coming out of early contemplative Christian teachings , as well as mystical Jewish and Islamic traditions .It has thematic links to the Jewish Kabbalah .The system and its component parts may have existed as an oral teaching for centuries as a way for people to overcome human mental and emotional \" fixations \" and find a greater sense of peace and transcendence .Since the publication of several books about the Enneagram in the late 1980s , the system of personality types located around the enneagram symbol has grown in popularity as a way to gain insight into oneself and develop greater empathy for others .The Centers , Types , and Subtypes .Three Centers and Nine Personality Types and 27 sub - types : What they are and how they aid in self - development .The nine points on the Enneagram represent nine distinct personality types - nine distinct worldviews or ways of paying attention associated with different patterns of thinking , feeling , and behaving .The Enneagram model suggests that each individual views 360 degrees of reality through a narrow slice of perception based on early coping strategies that were used to adapt to the environment in childhood .These coping strategies grow into patterns of perceiving the world and shape what we pay attention to and what we do n't pay attention to .These adaptive strategies help us to survive and thrive in childhood , but after we reach adulthood , they can represent overused strengths and an overly narrow set of habits through which we interact with the world .Studying your personality as defined by the Enneagram map can help you to see more clearly what you tend to think , feel , and do habitually and automatically .By becoming more aware of your unconscious habits , you can expand your capacity to interact with the world in more effective ways , and direct your behavior more from conscious choice rather than unconscious habit .Here is a brief description of the three centers : .According to the teaching behind the Enneagram , we humans perceive the world through three centers of intelligence , the head , which thinks thoughts , the heart , which feels emotions , and the body , which feels or senses kinesthetically or through \" gut knowing . \" Here is a brief description of the nine types : .Each of the nine types can be recognized by where its attention typically goes - and through particular patterns of thinking , feeling , and behaving .The power of the Enneagram map of personality lies in its highly accurate articulation of these patterns .Type One is sometimes called The Perfectionist in that they tend to view the world in terms of how it matches ( or does n't match ) what they view as perfect or ideal .Their focus of attention is on whether things are right or wrong , doing the right thing , noticing and correcting errors , and working hard to improve things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.12576"}
{"text": "Rage implies a violent , emotional reaction .While this may apply to sudden outbursts of violence in people , it really does n't help us determine why a similar incident occurred in dogs .The records of many dogs previously diagnosed with \" Springer Rage Syndrome \" were reviewed , and various forms of aggression were actually displayed .As part of my own behavior practice , I frequently evaluate dogs with so - called \" Rage Syndrome \" .So far , all of these dogs have been diagnosed with another form of aggression , including dominance aggression , fear - related aggression , resource guarding , and territorial behaviors .Dominance aggression was the most common diagnosis , when current diagnostic criteria were applied .Ilana Riesner DVM , formally of Cornell 's behavior clinic , did most of the groundbreaking research on \" Springer rage .\" Most of these springers actually showed a severe form of dominance aggression .A careful behavioral history revealed that the \" unprovoked \" attacks typically occurred in social situations , even though the owners were unable to predict when an attack would occur .One of the unique features of springers with this form of dominance aggression is the lack of warning before the aggression .The \" glazed look \" noted by owners is actually a very intense stare and dilated pupils .This is caused by sympathetic nervous stimulation , part of the fight or flight response .Whereas most dominant dogs gradually escalate the level of threat in social situations , moving from a stare , to growl , to lip curl , to snap and finally to bite , springers seem to move from stare to full - blown attack , skipping the intermediate stages .These dogs lacked impulse control and over - reacted in situations they perceived as threatening .Pedigree research showed that the most severe cases in springer spaniels could be traced back to a common bloodline .Cornell was very fortunate to be located in the geographic location to work with large numbers of these dogs , with the cooperation of breeders and owners .Many of the dogs studied by Dr. Reisner had abnormally low amounts of serotonin metabolites in their urine and cerebral spinal fluid .This suggested that the dominance aggression was associated with abnormally low levels of serotonin in the brain .This corresponded with findings in violent mental patients and prison inmates .Serotonin is one of the neurotransmitters , brain chemicals , that has a calming effect .In most mammals , it seems to decrease the amount of aggression associated with dominance .While it does n't necessarily change the social status of an animal , higher serotonin levels decrease the likelihood aggressive displays will be used to maintain that social position .Based on these findings , medications that increase serotonin levels were used to treat dominance aggression in dogs .About 50 % of the dominant aggressive dogs respond to these drugs , with a decrease in aggressive displays .The drugs do n't solve the problem , but they can make it safer and easier for owners to use behavior modification techniques to change the dog 's social status in the home .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.15143"}

{"text": "However , she first discovered the link between hidden shame and anger in her earlier study ( 1971 ) of psychotherapy sessions .She used a systematic technique to locate shame episodes in several hundred transcripts , then analyzed each episode , second by second , in the context in which it occurred .Unlike most other shame researchers , Lewis made relationship issues equal to emotional ones .Her analysis of emotions is also considerably more detailed and documented than other studies .For these reasons , it provides one of the main sources for the present paper .Lewis was both a research psychologist and a practicing psychoanalyst at the time of her first study of shame ( 1971 ) .One of her major contributions is the idea that shame is inherently a social emotion .Her formulation was bio - social : human beings are social by biological inheritance .That is , she saw shame as an instinct that has the function of signaling threats to the social bond .Just as the instinctual emotion of fear signals danger to life and limb , shame also signals a potential threat to survival , especially for an infant , threat to a social bond .In this same vein , Kaufman ( 1989 ) proposed that shame dynamics form the interpersonal bridge that connects individuals who would otherwise be isolated .In Lewis 's empirical study of shame ( 1971 ) she encountered shame because she used a systematic method for identifying emotions in verbal transcripts , the Gottschalk - Gleser method ( 1969 ; 1995 ) .This method involves long lists of key words that are correlated with specific emotions , such as anger , grief , fear , anxiety , and shame .Counting keywords , Lewis found that anger , fear , grief , and anxiety cues showed up from time to time in the transcripts .But she was unprepared for was the massive frequency of shame cues .Her methodology was complex , in that once a shame episode was located by Gottschalk 's method , Lewis also applied a qualitative method , analyzing each episode word by word .Lewis 's findings : .Prevalence : Lewis found a high frequency of shame markers in all sessions , far outranking markers of the other emotions combined .This finding suggests that shame was a dominant force in the sessions she analyzed .Lack of reference : Lewis noted that although shame markers were very frequent , patient or therapist almost never used the word shame or it 's near cognates .Even the relatively mild word embarrassment was seldom used .In analyzing the context in which shame markers occurred , Lewis identified situations in which the patient recounted a shameful memory , or seemed to feel distant from , criticized , or exposed by the therapist .These two contexts generated a cloud of shame markers .Both contexts fit the proposition that shame arises from seeing one 's self negatively from the point of view of the other ( Darwin 1872 ; Cooley 1922 ) .However , patients had two different , seemingly opposite responses in the shame context .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.75737"}

{"text": "The use of illegal occupation is well established as a means of protest in the United States and was used during the civil rights movement .But , of course , an appeal to tradition is a fallacy - the mere fact that something is well - established does not entail that it is justified .As such , an argument is needed to morally justify occupation as a means of protest .One argument for occupation as a means of protest is that protestors do not give up their rights simply because they are engaged in a protest .Assuming that they wish to engage in their protest where they would normally have the right to be , then it would seem to follow that they should be allowed to protest there .One obvious reply to this argument is that people do not automatically have the right to engage in protest in all places they have a right to visit .For example , a public library is open to the public , but it does not follow that people thus have a right to occupy a public library and interfere with its operation .This is because the act of protest would violate the rights of others in a way that would seem to warrant not allowing the protest .People also protest in areas that are not normally open to the public - or whose use by the public is restricted .This would include privately owned areas as well as public areas that have restrictions .In the case of the Bundy protest , public facilities are being occupied rather than private facilities .However , Bundy and his fellows are certainly using the area in a way that would normally not be allowed - people can not , in the normal course of things , just take up residence in public buildings .This can also be regarded as a conflict of rights - the right of protest versus the right of private ownership or public use .These replies can , of course , be overcome by showing that the protest does more good than harm or by showing that the right to protest outweighs the rights of others to use the area that is occupied .After all , to forbid protests simply because they might inconvenience or annoy people would be absurd .However , to accept protests regardless of the imposition on others would also be absurd .Being a protestor does not grant a person special rights to violate the rights of others , so a protestor who engages in such behavior would be acting wrongly and the protest would thus be morally wrong .After all , if rights are accepted to justify a right to protest , then this would provide a clear foundation for accepting the rights of those who would be imposed upon by the protest .If the protestor who is protesting tyranny becomes a tyrant to others , then the protest certainly loses its moral foundation .This provides the theoretical framework for assessing whether the Bundy protest is morally acceptable or not : it is a matter of weighing the merit of the protest against the harm done to the rights of other citizens ( especially those in the surrounding community ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.93315"}
{"text": "Research has shown that when we experience a crisis , we regress back to our primitive ancestors ; we go caveman !We fall back on most deeply ingrained instincts and habits that have served us well for eons by ensuring our survival , namely , by triggering the \" fight - or - flight \" response .This primal reaction produces intense physiological changes that increase our strength , heighten our senses , and bolster our endurance , all in the name of enabling us to fight more ferociously or run faster and longer .When confronted by a saber - toothed tiger or a rival tribesman , our ancestors had two basic options and we instinctively chose the one that we believed would maximize our chances of survival .Unfortunately , this ancient reaction that worked hundreds of thousands of years ago in the face of a crisis , wo n't work with the crises that we experience in the business world in the 21 st century .For example , if you have a conflict with a co - worker , hitting or running from them is not likely a winning strategy that will effectively resolve it .To the contrary , such a response will probably decrease your chances of survival in that jungle known as corporate life .Yet these primitive drives propel us to fall back on the instincts and habits of our forbearers .In fact , is there any more important situation when you need to have all of your most highly evolved capabilities running on all cylinders than during crises in today 's business world ?That 's when you have to respond in ways that go against millions of years of instincts .In a crisis , you need to be at our most evolved best , using your all of the extensive powers that your cerebral cortex can offer you .You must stay calm and rational .You need to be able to think methodically , flexibly , and creatively to discover solutions where the old rules and practices often wo n't work .You must reason and problem solve .You need to think through options and make effective decisions .Your Emotional Reaction to Crisis .In addition to the survival instinct that influences all of us , which emotions you experience and the intensity with which you feel them depends on a variety of factors .Your emotional hard - wiring influences the impact a crisis will have on you .There is clear evidence that temperament , that is , the characteristic ways in which you react emotionally , are innate .Some people are born highly sensitive and , as a result , are more likely to react emotionally to situations quickly and intensely .Conversely , other people are temperamentally stoic and , as a consequence , are less reactive emotionally .Your past experiences with emotions in general and during crises in particular also influence your immediate reactions .In contrast , those who have had little experience with work - related crises will likely not feel prepared or confident to respond to their challenges .Additionally , others who have struggled in crises will probably have developed negative attitudes and ineffective strategies that interfere with their ability to confront crises .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.38725"}

{"text": "However , there are cases where satyagraha will not be feasible .For instance , the enemy may be interested merely in inflicting military humiliation and may withdraw promptly after armed intervention .In some situations , the national population maybe too small in numbers to mount effective nonviolent resistance .In other situations , the invader may be interested merely in extracting raw materials , and may not require cooperation of the civilian population to do so .In most other instances , however , the Gandhian theory of power will become operational and give civilian defense a powerful means to foil the ambitions of an aggressor .The Norwegian resistance to Nazi rule , the Indian community satyagraha against the Transvaal government , the Chinese boycotts of 1905 , and the revolutionary change in Russia were not conducted in a liberal socio - political environment .Draconian laws were in effect , and in each case the government had the means to stamp out opposition promptly .It must be pointed out that with the exception of South African involvement , protestors resorted to satyagraha without fully understanding its principles or techniques , mainly because arms were not available .Even in South Africa , Gandhi was still experimenting with satyagraha , and it had not as yet attained the fullness of a strategy for conflict resolution .This was to happen much later .In India , satyagraha succeeded , not because British rule was democratic and liberal - the massacre of innocent women and men at Jalianwala Bagh pointed to the opposite - but because the British had ignored Gandhi 's early calls for satyagraha , thinking it to be an entirely eccentric and unworkable idea .The movement gathered force in the meantime , until it became too late to control the nationalists ' fervor or the moral \u00e9lan among the masses .Indeed , even in the late 1980s there is a persuasive evidence that satyagraha would be an appropriate alternative for conflict as a means of change .As one looks at Central American upheavals , such as those in Nicaragua and El Salvador , a certain similarity of underlying causes becomes apparent .There is not much dispute even among policy - makers in Washington that in each case the conflict is a result of long years of oppression , misery , and denial of freedom to the majority .However , in an oppressive environment , tightly - knit violent revolutionary movements spring up , plunging the country into civil war .The masses want neither communism not the semi - feudal oligarchies that have been the rule in Central America , and certainly they do not want civil war .In fact , when the revolutionaries succeed , as they did in Nicaragua in 1979 , the results may be different only in degree from the oppression of the past .Born in violence , and threatened by great powers like the United States and its surrogates , a revolutionary government has no choice but to enforce austerity and strict rule .However , in each case the guerilla movement could not have succeeded without mass support .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.82407"}

{"text": "29 As would be expected from our experience with aggression among primates , dominance as a form of aggression is most manifest in males .Among females dominance becomes a composed ( versus shy or bashful ) , poised , hypochondriac , and to a lesser extent , reserved , secretive , and independent - minded temperament .30 In young children a dominating temperament goes along with disobedience , teasing , insensitiveness , not respecting the property of others , bossing , and attacking verbally and physically .In other animals , the dominance pattern has been found associated with masculine sexual aggression , grabbing food from others , and bullying , 31 as well as concentration of the male hormone ( testosterone ) .In apes , this temperament includes initiating most fighting , never cringing under aggression , mounting subordinates regardless of sex , preempting food supply , being more active , initiating more play , and doing more grooming .In mental outpatients , the dominance temperament involves a lack of guilt feeling , little need of approval , strong assertiveness , and overt expression of hostility .Among psychotics , it includes bullying and aggressiveness ; being assaultive , obscene , irritable , critical , and sarcastic ; having temper outbursts ; and using projection to escape unacceptable drives .Little more evidence is needed , I think , to show that this temperament is basically aggressive .It clearly has the characteristics denoting aggression in animals and many of those we have come to associate with aggressive natures , aggressive persons , or aggression per se .Noteworthy is that this temperament seems partly ( about half ) hereditary , with some physiological correlation , and partly environmental .Heredity seems to contribute most to its variation from one family to another , whereas differences within families seem to be mainly due to environment .One more distinct temperament component is related to aggression -- the paranoidal versus innerly relaxed temperament .The paranoidal are suspicious , jealous , self - sufficient , and withdrawn ; the innerly relaxed are trustful , understanding , composed , and socially at home .Of special interest here is that the paranoidal are also aggressive , short - tempered , extrapunitive , hostile , 35 and feel systematically persecuted .36 Paranoidal psychotics , especially , are assaultive , uncooperative , delusioned , and obsessed ; paranoidal mental outpatients have been found with obsessively hostile impulses and high tension .This temperament appears both in normal and abnormal people ( who tend to be at the extremes of the temperament ) and is distinct from paranoid schizophrenia ( which has been found as a separate temperament also existing in normal people ) .Those with a tendency toward the paranoidal end are basically characterized by high tension handled by projection as a defense mechanism , and by suspicion and hostility .Therefore , that aggression should also be part of or a result of temperament is understandable .In sum , we find that aggressiveness as a potential does not have a unitary source .Rather , it comprises attitudes subsidiating to the needs for self - assertion ( status striving ) and pugnacity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.336685"}

{"text": "Opposition through satyagraha involved the imprisonment of thousands of Indians and eventually led to the nullification of those laws .After arriving in India , Gandhi implemented satyagraha in 1916 - 17 against the British indigo planters at Champaran in Bihar , where peasant cultivators were unfairly treated and taxed .In 1918 satyagraha was also brought to bear on the dispute between the textile mill owners and labourers in Ahmedabad and involved a strike by workers .The technique of satyagraha was subsequently practiced in 1924 on behalf of the untouchables , who had been forbidden to use the roads in the vicinity of the Vykom temple in Travancore , South India .Having refined his strategy on relatively smaller stages , Gandhi launched a series of satyagraha campaigns , beginning in 1930 , which involved mass participation in civil resistance and non - co - operation aimed at the British .In the majority of these campaigns Gandhi achieved remarkable success , gaining ever growing popular participation and support for his declared objectives .Implicit in satyagraha was Gandhi 's assumption that all rulers are dependent for their position and power upon the obedience and cooperation of the ruled .Their power therefore comes from outside themselves .If subjects withdraw cooperation and refuse to submit , a regime will become seriously weakened .After an analysis of five major satyagraha campaigns launched by Gandhi during the struggle for national independence , Joan Bondurant concludes : ' In examining satyagraha in action , it becomes clear that satyagraha operates as a force to effect change ' .To succeed , it required ' a comprehensive program of planning , preparation , and studied execution , ' and not simply a spontaneous upsurge of mass protest .Satyagraha failed whenever ' one or more of the stages of the campaign was slighted . 'Joan Bondurant maintains that religious or philosophical compatibilities alone do not explain Gandhi 's success in India .In fact , the theory of conflict underlying satyagraha and the strategy it yields have wider applications that go well beyond India .She cites the Khudai Khidmatgar ( Servants of God ) movement among Pathan Muslims in the Northwest Frontier Province of British India , in which Khan Abdul Gafar Khan , their leader , recruited thousands of Muslim supporters and carried out a successful nonviolent struggle .The Muslim Pathans are known for their bravery , and their general population lives by the creed of military honor and valor in battle .Indeed , in one rather touching episode described by the author , Muslim Pathan women , who are traditionally wo nt to hide behind a veil , when forced , they lay down with copies of the Quran clutched to their hearts .Gene Sharp , in his book , Gandhi as a Political Strategist , cites several more instances of satyagraha and persuasively argues that since Gandhi 's use of it in India , the technique has been implemented far more widely than is generally believed .Among the most important instances he cites is its adoption by Martin Luther King , Jr. , against racist practices in the United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.182434"}

'This test may prove to be underwhelming for the North Koreans , but still sets off at least three alarm bells .First , it is a technological achievement because regardless of the success of the fusion technology , whether boosted or two - stage , North Korea will benefit from the new data generated by the test .The next test might not be a failure and North Korea is producing enough fissile material to ' waste ' it on testing rather than saving it for nuclear weapons in its arsenal .Second , the test demonstrates Pyongyang remains willing to be an international pariah despite international pressure and waning support from China .Previously , North Korea relied heavily on Chinese financial and political support , but that may no longer be the case as Beijing has already condemned the test , as it did in 2013 , and summoned the North Korean ambassador to lodge a protest .The big question is whether or not China has the leverage to reign in Pyongyang .And finally , North Korea continues to rely on nuclear weapons for regime security and as a symbol of the Kim dynasty 's longevity and status on par with other nuclear powers .North Korea is not alone in its reliance on nuclear weapons .Over the past two years Russia has participated in nuclear ' sabre - rattling ' and continued to emphasize the role of nuclear weapons in its military doctrine .Other states , such as Pakistan , remain reliant on nuclear weapons for security , as well , in the face of a conventionally superior adversary .Nuclear disarmament advocates will likely point to today 's test as evidence of the need for a nuclear weapons ban and for nuclear possessors to further reduce reliance on nuclear weapons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "120.582985"}
