Ware said .The panel also instructed technology companies it did not identify to preserve any relevant documents in their possession .The development on Capitol Hill came the same day The Associated Press reported the existence of a personal email server traced back to the Chappaqua , New York , home of Clinton .The unusual practice of a Cabinet - level official running her own email server would have given Clinton - who is expected to run for president in the 2016 campaign - significant control over limiting access to her message archives .The practice also would complicate the State Department 's legal responsibilities in finding and turning over official emails in response to any investigations , lawsuits or public records requests .The department would be in the position of accepting Clinton 's assurances she was surrendering everything required that was in her control .\" The mystery deepens with the revelation of exactly who was in charge of Sec .Clinton 's private server , one Eric Hoteham , a man with a long Clintonian association : .The former president 's full name is William Jefferson Clinton .Hothem , the former Clinton aide , surfaced in at least two Clinton administration controversies .A congressional report in 2002 investigating pardons said a Citibank account linked to Hothem wired $ 15,000 to President Clinton 's brother , Roger , in March 2001 , while investigators were trying to compel Roger Clinton to testify about his role in several pardon cases .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.743008"}

FULL POST .CBS correspondent Lara Logan apologized Friday and said the network was \" wrong \" for a \" 60 Minutes \" report that raised questions about the Obama administration 's response to last year 's attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi , Libya .The assault left four Americans dead , including Ambassador Christopher Stevens . \" In this case , we were wrong .We made a mistake , \" she said on \" CBS This Morning . \"\" That 's disappointing for any journalist .It 's very disappointing for me . \" A primary source for the \" 60 Minutes \" report on October 27 was a security contractor using the pseudonym \" Morgan Jones , \" later identified as Dylan Davies .Davies told CBS he was able to reach the Benghazi compound on the night of September 11 , 2012 , scale a wall and even fight off a militant .That story cast doubt on whether the Obama administration sent all possible help to try to save Stevens and his three colleagues .The \" 60 Minutes \" story was cited by congressional Republicans who have demanded to know why a military rescue was not attempted .When U.S. commandos grabbed a former al Qaeda operative in Tripoli this month , American forces were just hours away from potentially launching a more dangerous covert raid to capture a militia figure facing charges in the deadly Benghazi terror attack , U.S. officials tell CNN .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.009186"}
