Richmond recently introduced The Microenterprise and Youth Development Act ( H.R. 2809 ) which would help boost youth entrepreneurship by creating an Office of Youth Entrepreneurship at the Small Business Administration .The office would provide young innovators with the professional and technical support they need to grow their businesses .The legislation also calls for the Office of Youth Entrepreneurship to work with the Department of Education to research and recommend legislation to Congress that would create a youth entrepreneurship loan forgiveness program for federal student loans .The Microenterprise and Youth Development Act ( H.R. 2809 ) aims to address the critical issues of youth unemployment and slow growth in this country .The legislation is supported by the Young Invincibles , a national organization working to promote policies that will create an economic environment in which young small business owners can thrive .\" Our young people are national assets .We should listen to what their needs are , so that we can provide them with the support they deserve for them to succeed , \" Congressman Richmond said .Category Archives : Colorado House .We 're surprised at how little coverage there 's been of a bill that could become a major flashpoint , House Bill 16 - 1002 -the bill reauthorizing the state 's parental leave law for academic responsibilities that was on the books for years before it sunset last year .But as exciting as the debate over this bill has been , there has been little discussion in the mainstream press .In addition to the Chalkbeat Colorado story we linked to yesterday , the Grand Junction Sentinel 's Charles Ashby wrote this week : .Democrats , who support HB1002 and enacted the law in 2009 at a time when they held full control of the Legislature , said it 's an important law to keep because parents need to be involved in their children 's education .Republicans , who killed a similar bill last year to continue the law , said it 's not needed , saying it also places an unfair burden on businesses .Rep.

Kevin Priola 's unintentional validation of the need for it demonstrates - even more by his subsequent no vote on the bill - the political danger in opposing parental leave is not apparent to them .The latter happens all the time , but they do n't always undercut themselves so ironically .Yesterday , supporters of Planned Parenthood delivered a petition signed by over 60,000 people across the nation calling for GOP Rep.

{"text": "As the Colorado Independent 's Corey Hutchins reports , Republicans in the Colorado General Assembly led by Sen. Tim Neville are pushing most of the usual slate of pro - gun bills in 2016 , starting with another attempt to repeal the 15-round magazine limit passed in 2013 : .Lawmakers in Colorado , including one state Senator who 's running for higher office , have introduced at least three measures to expand gun rights so far at the start of this year 's legislative session .One of the bills , unsurprisingly , is aimed at rolling back a 2013 package of legislation that limited to 15 the amount of bullets a gun magazine could hold in Colorado .One of the sponsors in the Senate is Tim Neville of Jefferson County who is running in the crowded GOP primary field for U.S. Senate this year .The bill is pretty simple : It repeals the 2013 law , and \" declares that this act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace , health , and safety . \"Another bill , also sponsored in part by Neville , would extend to the workplace the state 's ' Make My Day ' law , which allows Coloradans to use deadly force against intruders in their own homes under certain circumstances .This new law would allow the same ability to \" owners , managers , and employees of businesses .\"A third measure would scrap the permitting requirements for carrying a concealed weapon in Colorado .The last of these bills mentioned , Senate Bill 16 - 017 eliminating additional permit requirements to carry concealed weapons , is up for a hearing tomorrow in the Senate State Affairs Committee .Interestingly , we have not seen a bill yet to repeal the requirement for background checks to be conducted for most gun purchases , something gun rights supporters has clamored loudly for but has always been the most popular of the 2013 reform measures .Today , polling in Colorado and nationally shows consistent and enduring support for expanding background checks , making Colorado a leader on the issue - so maybe this is a fight we wo n't be having in Colorado in 2016 .This idea was championed last year by Jon Caldara of the Independence Institute as an incremental measure , but was summarily rejected by Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and their powerful bloc of legislators - who say any magazine limit \" compromise \" short of full repeal would be unacceptable .The latest word as we understand it is that Democrats have no interest in either helping Caldara look good or defusing internal conflict between Republicans - which sharply reduces the possibility of the Democratic defections Caldara would need .That combined with the RMGO 's lockdown of its member legislators against raising the mag limit seems to indicate that no such end run is in the offing .If that changes you 'll know , because nothing turns up the volume at the Capitol like a good squabble over guns .In the wake of Tim Leonard 's victory in the GOP Colorado House District 25 vacancy committee selection this past weekend , dissidents led by ubiquitous conservative watchdog Marilyn Marks are challenging the process by which the members of the vacancy committee were organized .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.41321"}

{"text": "Factoring in growth , the Romney tax plan would lose about $ 137 billion annually for the government instead of $ 338 billion , the foundation says .If the Romney plan then capped a household 's tax deductions at $ 17,000 - which Romney has suggested - the plan would lose only $ 14 billion for the government : .The combination of the additional revenue from economic growth and the limitation on itemized deductions comes very close to making the plan revenue neutral at the end of the period .Taking the foundation 's analysis one step further , if Romney raised the cap on deductions to , say $ 25,000 or $ 50,000 , the plan would not be projected to increase the deficit .But that 's only if the model takes into account the impact of tax cuts on growth .( Which is a never - ending debate between conservatives and liberals .The latest study to tackle such claims , by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service , found that changes in the top tax rates over the past 65 years appeared to be uncorrelated with economic growth . )Expect the Romney campaign to cite the Tax Foundation 's study as it rebuts the charge that his plan would increase the deficit or have to raise taxes on the middle class .Post navigation .About this Blog .The blog for the Dallas Morning News politics team tracks Dallas Fort Worth area , Texas and national campaigns .Trailblazers U.S. Conference of Mayors Dallas US Senate race Veterans View from DC Voting rights Wendy Davis Y'all !Political Cornflakes .Tribune Political Reporters .Political Cornflakes is a clearinghouse for all kinds of intriguing political tidbits from our political team in Salt Lake City and Washington , D.C.
