Bernie Sanders handily defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday , but she may come out of the state on top in the delegate count due to the pre - pledged support of superdelegates .Here 's why : New Hampshire has 24 Democratic delegates distributed based on the number of votes each candidate receives .According to the Associated Press , the Vermont senator earned at least 13 of the Democratic delegates with 60 percent of the vote in the Granite State .Because New Hampshire is n't a winner - take - all state , Clinton won at least nine delegates with her 38 percent of the vote .A remaining two delegates have yet to be determined based on popular vote totals , according to AP .But New Hampshire also has eight Democratic \" superdelegates \" - party insiders who are n't bound by the popular vote outcome and can support any candidate they choose .Six of the superdelegates said before Tuesday night 's voting that they plan to support Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in July .That support is n't binding , though - superdelegates can switch candidates between now and the convention .Clinton 's Granite State superdelegates include New Hampshire Democratic lawmakers Gov. Maggie Hassan , Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Rep. Annie Kuster , according to The Hill .One of the undecided superdelegates is Ray Buckley , chairman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party , who was barred by state party rules from selecting a candidate prior to the primary in an effort to maintain neutrality .Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina have dropped out of the Republican presidential race after a very poor showing in the New Hampshire primaries .Fiorina finished 7th with 4 % of the vote and Christie finished 6th with about 7.5 % of the vote .Carly Fiorina had a short and meteoric rise as she performed strong at times during the debates , but it just never translated to a rise in the polls .With regards to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , to be honest , his run for the GOP presidential nomination was over before it began .Pundits pondered why Christie 's campaign never got traction and why even after he knee - capped establishment darling Marco Rubio showing him to be robitoc , Christie gained nada in the polls .Really , is it that hard to understand ?With all due respect to Christie , his presidential run ended when he decided to hug Barack Obama during the president 's photo - op trip to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy and what looked like a date between Obama and Christie on the boardwalk at the Jersey shore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.005714"}
