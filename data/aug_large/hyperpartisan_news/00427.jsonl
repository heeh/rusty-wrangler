{"text": "John Kerry was the perfect opponent against whom to test the appeal of an anti-1960s message ; the memory of \" the sixties , \" especially of the Vietnam War and the antiwar movement , heavily influenced the 2004 presidential campaign .In four campaigns between 1994 and 2004 , two for the governorship of Texas and two for the presidency , Bush thought it expedient to invoke a restoration of the pre-1960s America he had experienced during his childhood in Texas in the 1950s .And he was proved right .Nostalgia , therefore , plays an integral part in contemporary American political culture .For the Right , the 1960s replaced an earlier version of America in which the country was moral and just .The 1960s elicited anger on the Right by questioning this cherished notion -- the mythical view of Americans as noble , fair , honest , and righteous -- and arguing that the nation needed to change .The 1960s rejection of traditional values challenged the established view of American exceptionalism , and in doing so eventually destroyed liberalism and propelled the modern Right to power .The Republican presidents from 1980 on -- Reagan and the two Bushes -- all vigorously tapped into a national longing for pre-1960s America .Each expressed a desire to return the nation to a past recalled as calmer , rosier , and more certain , an America imagined as free of racial , generational , and ideological conflict .While Reagan and George H. W. Bush came of age well before the 1960s , the younger Bush shared this nostalgia as a kind of cultural legacy .All three promised to restore to public life the virtues supposedly lost through the misguided policies of the \" bad sixties .\" While a young George W. Bush bridled at the changes taking place in the late 1960s , Bill Clinton was a rising star just beginning to shine .Those changes opened up opportunities to the young man from Arkansas that would not have been available ten years earlier .The country was breaking Clinton 's way in 1968 , not Bush 's way .These perceptions would linger in each man 's mind and help define today 's political climate .What drives the differences between liberals and conservatives ?This book offers the memory of the 1960s as the answer .When future historians seek to explain the dynamics of U.S. politics in the last quarter of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty - first , they will find a helpful tool in the use , and misuse , of the memory of that era .Over three decades later , the 1960s still cast a long shadow over American politics .\" The 1960s serve as a hinge of history , \" said political author Bob Woodward .one 's view of the era answers the question , \" Which side were you on ? \" 22 Former left - wing radical Tom Hayden remarked in 2004 that we were still fighting over the 1960s \" because people shaped by the sixties will dominate our institutions for another decade , and also because the issues raised by the sixties have continued . \" 23 Like the Civil War , \" the sixties \" divided America , and for a generation or more after the struggles and conflicts of the 1960s ended , the nation has continued to argue over the decade 's impact .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "44.89902"}

W. Bush grew up in an age of strong faith in the power of government to improve people 's lives .But that belief did not survive the 1960s .The generation of Reagan ( born 1911 ) and Bush ( born 1924 ) turned against the activist government of the 1960s and the interventionist programs it spawned .This book is also , therefore , about generations .Like Reagan , Bush staked his political success on demonizing the 1960s .Also like Reagan , he claimed to have \" kicked the Vietnam syndrome , \" in his case by waging the 1991 Persian Gulf War .As the first baby boomer to run for president , Clinton renewed and reintensified the national debate over the meaning of the 1960s .I examine how Clinton constructed the 1960s , and specifically how he recast them to suit the 1990s , a conservative era at odds with everything 1960s liberalism stood for .Clinton used the liberal 1960s icons he so dearly loved -- John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King -- to promote his own centrist political agenda , his \" Third Way . \" Clinton 's succession by his fellow baby boomer George W. Bush only prolonged the national debate over the 1960s .Few public officials exemplify anger toward \" the sixties \" more than Bush , whose political ethos was based primarily on a desire to overturn what he saw as the harm done by that era .And there is a reason he felt this way : by 1968 , when he graduated from college , Bush knew that he had lost his cultural inheritance .The East Coast establishment had been challenged by the decade 's changes , and the world Bush once expected to inherit had vanished .The times were changing indeed , and too fast for some .To this day George W. Bush remains aggrieved by what did not happen in the 1960s : he feels he was cheated out of the legacy that he had coming to him .Bush 's hostility to the 1960s led him all the way to the White House in 2000 and to reelection in 2004 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.754456"}

Ford , a moderate Republican , issued a preemptive pardon of Nixon , ending the investigations of Nixon but eroding his own popularity .[56 ] .Aware that he had not been elected to either the office of president or vice - president , Gerald Ford asked the American people to give him their support , saying \" Our long national nightmare is over . \"His administration witnessed the final collapse of South Vietnam after the Democrat - controlled Congress voted to terminate all aid to that country .Ford 's attempts to curb the growing problem of inflation met with little success , and his only solution seemed to be encouraging people to wear shirt buttons with the slogan WIN ( Whip Inflation Now ) on them .He also appointed a Supreme Court justice , John Paul Stevens , who retired in 2010 .During Ford 's administration , the nation also celebrated its 200th birthday on July 4 , 1976 .The event brought some enthusiasm to an American populace that was feeling cynical and disillusioned from Vietnam , Watergate , and economic difficulties .Ford 's pardon of Nixon just before the 1974 midterm elections was not well received , and the Democrats made major gains , bringing to power a generation of young liberal activists , many of them suspicious of the military and the CIA .[57 ] [ 58 ] .The Watergate scandal was still fresh in the voters ' minds when former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter , a Washington , DC outsider known for his integrity , prevailed over nationally better - known politicians in the Democratic Party Presidential primaries in 1976 .Faith in government was at a low ebb , and so was voter turnout .Carter became the first candidate from the Deep South to be elected President since the American Civil War .He stressed the fact that he was an outsider , not part of the Beltway political system , and that he was not a lawyer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.363113"}

Why would American business corporations support policies that would undercut the American economy ?Faux : Because globalization is dramatically disconnecting the relationship between American corporate employers and their employees .There has always been conflict over the shares of the benefits of worker productivity going to profits and wages .But until recently , you could assume that both workers and businesses had a common interest in producing in America .As companies became multinational , whether they actually produced in America was irrelevant to their investors and top managers .The boss might be an American by birth and culture , but he or she no longer identified the future of the company with the future of America .They were paid to invest where the cost of labor and environmental regulation was cheapest .This reality has not yet seeped into our political consciousness .When the CEOs of these multinationals or their lobbyists walk into the White House or the office of a member of Congress or hold a press conference to rail against \" protectionism , \" the media often assumes that they are representing American interests .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.21614"}

So it was a case of na\u00efve economic analysis ?Faux : For some .But I think for most politicians economic theory conveniently rationalized their support of the interests of corporate CEOs over their workers .Remember , over the last 30 years , the share of campaign contributions representing big business has grown dramatically - as has the number of ex - administration officials and members of Congress who go to work for corporations as employees , consultants , and lobbyists .Q.

Douglas , proposed that each territory should decide the question for itself through referendum .The issue split the Democrats at their 1860 presidential convention , where Southern Democrats nominated John C.

Mark Sanford , that reaffirms the antiquated act of secession .In a coordinated move , the second Provisional Confederate Congress , representing all Confederate states and territories , voted today for CSA presidential candidates .Dr. Ron Paul of Texas was elected President of the Confederate States of America , succeeding Jefferson Davis ; and nuclear physicist Ray McKinney of Georgia will serve as Vice - President , succeeding Alexander Stephens .The CSA Election of 1867 , to determine the Davis - Stephens administration 's successors , had been postponed until today due to Reconstruction .According to the original CSA Constitution , President - Elect Paul is term - limited by the Confederate founders to a single six - year term ( 2005 - 2011 ) , even though he will only serve a portion of it . Col .Beauxyeux Wayne Vance , delegate to the provisional Congress from South Carolina , explains that he can not find where in history any of the Confederate states ever rescinded their secessions .Col .Vance , whose first name is pronounced \" Bo \" , recalls the first meeting where this apparently dry historical fact became a vibrant call to action for anti - Unionists .\" You know , Beauregard he just ast plain out the blue why Dr. Paul do n't use the Confederate Constitution ' stead of the Union Constitution , seeing 's he 's from Texas .Then ol' Billy Joe Wayne wants to know when we ever voted the Union back in after all , and we - all could n't nary of us figger it out .Too much Jack Daniel 's I ' spect .So that - all 's just what we did . \"After this initial April meetup and a summer Constitutional convention , the Confederacy quietly began registering its citizens in each Confederate state and territory .With typical Southron hospitality , the CSA lays no claim on any other region , leaving the Union the dregs of the blue states and flyover country .Y'all never heard of a rump session ?\" Apparently the absent legislators , who were presumably Union - loyal , were of no concern to Col .Vance : \" Course some Unionists we ai n't routed out yet , but who cares for them , they 're furriners here anyways .\" Most Southronfolk we interviewed affirmed that they had nothing to do with \" that other country \" ; they simply wanted their occupied territory back .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.15618"}

Bush , and George Bush .The actor garnered a lot of controversy during the 1990s for claiming right wingers had been subjugated and anti - white views had become mainstream .From 1998 until 2003 , Heston was also the President of the National Rifle Association , a title that was later skewered by Michael Moore in the Academy Award winning documentary Bowling For Columbine .John Wayne .Photo : WENN.com .Before Charlton Heston became Hollywood 's Republican outcast , John Wayne fit the role like a glove .Though Wayne 's conservative politics were accepted after World War II , things took a turn when he showed his support for America 's conflict in Vietnam .In 1968 , he produced and starred in The Green Berets , the most blatant piece of pro-'Nam propaganda to come out of Hollywood and a film that 's content stood in stark contrast to the actual war being fought .Though Wayne was hugely popular with Republicans , he was vilified by the majority of his Hollywood peers .Many actors who starred in his later films claimed they were blacklisted because of their affiliation with Wayne .Toward the end of his career , Hollywood would eventually accept Wayne and vice - versa .In 1979 The Duke presented an Academy Award for Best Picture to the makers of the anti - Vietnam war film The Deer Hunter .Months later Wayne succumbed to stomach cancer .Arnold Schwarzenegger .With The Terminator series , Arnold Schwarzenegger ruled Hollywood as one of Tinsel Town 's biggest stars .Then , in 2003 , things took a turn when he went after a very different role - that of California 's Governor .He won the part , of course , thus beginning a rocky new relationship with the entertainment industry .Despite beginning a career with record high approval ratings , Schwarzenegger ended his run with a record low .In 2010 , the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Schwarzenegger one of the 11 worst governors in the U.S. due to a lack of ethics while in office .This claim was in part substantiated by allegations of sexual misconduct leveled at the governor , who many re - dubbed \" The Gropenator . \"In 2011 , a sex scandal involving Schwarzenegger 's fathering of an illegitimate son with a Guatemalan nanny more or less confirmed the lack of ethics .Now out of office and divorced , Arnold is attempting an acting comeback to wipe the slate of bad political moral and decisions clean .Clint Eastwood .Before Arnold decided to step into office , Clint Eastwood was splitting his time acting in films with acting as an elected official .The libertarian star was mayor of Carmel - By - The - Sea , California from 1986 to 1988 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.835175"}

Goldwater by a landslide in 1964 , his national support waned because of bitter opposition to the Vietnam War , and he chose not to run for reelection .Following the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 , the party nominated Johnson 's vice president , Hubert H. Humphrey , at a fractious convention in Chicago that was marred by violence outside the hall between police and protesters .Meanwhile , many Southern Democrats supported the candidacy of Alabama Governor George C. Wallace , an opponent of federally mandated racial integration .In the 1968 election Humphrey was soundly defeated by Nixon in the electoral college ( among Southern states Humphrey carried only Texas ) , though he lost the popular vote by only a narrow margin .From 1972 to 1988 the Democrats lost four of five presidential elections .In 1972 the party nominated antiwar candidate George S. McGovern , who lost to Nixon in one of the biggest landslides in U.S. electoral history .Two years later the Watergate scandal forced Nixon 's resignation , enabling Jimmy Carter , then the Democratic governor of Georgia , to defeat Gerald R. Ford , Nixon 's successor , in 1976 .Although Carter orchestrated the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel , his presidency was plagued by a sluggish economy and by the crisis over the kidnapping and prolonged captivity of U.S. diplomats in Iran following the Islamic revolution there in 1979 .Carter was defeated in 1980 by conservative Republican Ronald W. Reagan , who was easily reelected in 1984 against Carter 's vice president , Walter F. Mondale .Mondale 's running mate , Geraldine A. Ferraro , was the first female candidate on a major - party ticket .Reagan 's vice president , George Bush , defeated Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 .Despite its losses in the presidential elections of the 1970s and ' 80s , the Democratic Party continued to control both houses of Congress for most of the period ( although the Republicans controlled the Senate from 1981 to 1987 ) .In 1992 Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton recaptured the White House for the Democrats by defeating Bush and third - party candidate Ross Perot .Clinton 's support of international trade agreements ( e.g. , the North American Free Trade Agreement ) and his willingness to cut spending on social programs to reduce budget deficits alienated the left wing of his party and many traditional supporters in organized labour .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.66011"}

{"text": "Populism in Latin America has been sometimes criticized for the fiscal policies of many of its leaders , but has also been defended for having allowed historically weak states to buy off disorder and achieve a tolerable degree of stability while initiating large - scale industrialization .Thus though specific populist fiscal and monetary policies may be criticized by economic historians , populism has also allowed leaders and parties to co - opt the radical ideas of the masses so as to redirect them in a non revolutionary direction .Often adapting a nationalist vocabulary and rhetorically convincing , populism was used to appeal to broad masses while remaining ideologically ambivalent .Notwithstanding , there have been notable exceptions . 21stCentury Latin - American populist leaders have had a decidedly socialist bent .When populists do take strong positions on economic philosophies such as capitalism versus socialism , the position sparks strong emotional responses regarding how best to manage the nation 's current and future social and economic position .Mexico 's 2006 Presidential election was hotly debated ( even if only among its social elite ) among Mexicans who supported and opposed populist candidate Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador .Inequality .Populism in Latin American countries has both an economic and an ideological edge .Other perspectives trace inequality to the formation of Latin America 's governments and institutions , which were shaped by the Spanish crown upon the conquest of the Americas by the Spaniards .Latin America was not meant to be a colony for the settlers to live in and develop , like the United States , but a source of resources for the Spanish crown .After the nations obtained their independence , many colonial legacies survived .Populists can be very successful political candidates in such countries .In appealing to the masses of poor people prior to gaining power , populists may promise widely - demanded food , housing , employment , basic social services , and income - redistribution .Once in political power , they may not always be financially or politically able to fulfill all these broad promises .However , they are very often successful in stretching to provide many broad and basic services .Economics debate on populism and socialist populism .In Mexico , Brazil and Argentina in a relatively short period of time , populist leaders were perceived to have delivered more to their lower class constituents than previous governments .Critics of populist policies point to the infamous consequences of spending and lack of reform on these countries ' respective finances involving growing debt , pressured currencies , and hyperinflation , which in turn led to high interest rates , low growth , and debt crisis .The 1980s in Latin America became referred to as a lost decade during which the region experienced low economic growth and few if any reductions in poverty while the Asian Tigers have been consistently developing through high rates of savings , investments , and educational achievements .Supporters of past economic policies would point to the uncontrollable economic consequences of high oil prices to much of the world economy during the 1970s and the unanticipated fall in commodity prices that would later complicate financing past spending .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.04866"}
{"text": "Classical Populism .Populism is a vague , slippery concept .Its definition and utility have long been contested among academics , more often than not the term carrying with it pejorative connotations .The simplest way to view populism is as a rhetorical style , one that divides society into two contending groups-\"the people \" and \" the elite .\" This implies the creation of new political subjects , but also the merging of old class identities .There is no room for a working class with interests sometimes counterpoised to those of the \" lumpenproletarian , \" the petty proprietor or the peasant - they are all \" the people . \"The differentiation between intellectuals , certain capitalists and the old landed elite is similarly subsumed under the umbrella of \" the oligarchy .\" The populist leadership style has proved especially successful in Latin America , finding its archetype in the mid-20th century presidency of Juan Per\u00f3n .A colorful campaigner , Per\u00f3n gained the loyalty of both a newly urbanized working class and a nascent industrial bourgeoisie .The former military officer 's charismatic leadership proved enough to foster a shaky compromise between the two rising social classes .Workers submitted to a Faustian bargain , their unions recognized and labors rewarded with higher wages and more responsive social services , but their struggles co - opted and institutionalized .Argentina 's \" infamous decade \" was followed by Per\u00f3n 's presidency .Per\u00f3n 's policies stood on a radical \" center , \" between both socialism and traditional liberal capitalism .They were analogous , in some respects , to the social democratic policies that flourished in postwar Europe .Like those regimes , Per\u00f3n 's relied on a historic class compromise .The support of newly urbanized workers gave classical populists a proletarian veneer , but Per\u00f3n also drew support from middle - class elements who sympathized with redistribution and benefited from state - sponsored economic programs .Even certain segments of the elite were in league with populists : The co - opting of portions of the labor movement into populist parties created a climate where an uneasy \" pro - industrial \" alliance between workers and industrial capitalists could prevail .The charismatic glue of the populist leader was enough to bottle up the class contradictions of such an arrangement .Rhetorical appeals to the descamisados ( Per\u00f3n 's impoverished , working class supporters ) aside , Per\u00f3n , like others in the populist orbit , never encouraged class struggle or attempted to structurally undermine the bourgeois state .It was his recognition of friendly unions and the material rewards of economic prosperity during the early years of his presidency that crowded out support for left - wing challengers .For the first time , as well , the state began to recognize and enforce labor laws .Unions and Per\u00f3n relied on each other for legitimization .After being swept from power in the 1950s , Per\u00f3n made an improbable political comeback .But on his 1973 return , the president openly supported his party 's right - wing .But his moment was over .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.15145"}

{"text": "[28 ] In this case , distressed middle - class populists during the pre-Nazi Weimar period mobilized their anger at government and big business .The Nazis \" parasitized the forms and themes of the populists and moved their constituencies far to the right through ideological appeals involving demagoguery , scapegoating , and conspiracism .\" [ 29 ]According to Fritzsche : .In Argentina in the 1940s , a local brand of authoritarian populism emerged known as Peronism , after its leader Juan Per\u00f3n .It emerged from an intellectual authoritarian movement in the 1920s and 1930s that delegitimized democracy .[ 31 ] .Therefore , populism espouses government by the people as a whole ( that is to say , the masses ) .This is in contrast to aristocracy , synarchy or plutocracy , each of which is an ideology that espouse government by a small , privileged group above the masses .Populism rose during the Reformation ; Protestant groups like the Anabaptists formed ideas about ideal theocratic societies , in which peasants would be able to read the Bible themselves .Attempts to establish these societies were made during the German Peasants ' War ( 1524 - 1525 ) and the M\u00fcnster Rebellion ( 1534 - 1535 ) .The peasant movement ultimately failed as cities and nobles made their own peace with the princely armies , which restored the old order under the nominal overlordship of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , represented in German affairs by his younger brother Ferdinand .[ 33 ] .The same conditions contributed to the outbreak of the English Revolution of 1642 - 1651 , also known as the English Civil War .Conditions led to a proliferation of ideologies and political movements among peasants , self - employed artisans , and working - class people in England .Many of these groups had a dogmatic Protestant religious bent .They included Puritans and the Levellers .[34 ] .[ 37 ] Ideologically , Latin American populism , with its emphasis on nation - building under an authoritarian leadership as a prerequisite for technological modernization , betrayed the earlier influence of Comtean positivism .[40 ] .Populist practitioners and movements in Latin America usually adapt politically to the prevailing mood of the nation , moving within the ideological spectrum from left to right many times during their political lives .Therefore , it is not surprising that 1960s populism was associated mainly with radical , left - leaning petty - bourgeois nationalism , which emptied the State of its function as a coercive class -rule apparatus and saw it instead as an organ of representation of the Nation as a whole .[45 ] Such was the case , for instance , of the Goulart government ( 1961 - 1964 ) in Brazil , Goulart being described as a fiery populist who identified - mainly rhetorically - with the dispossessed and tried to foster a reformist agenda through ties to the organized Left .[47 ] Consequently , populism was eventually identified by the 1970s military dictatorships as \" demagogery \" and as a risk to the stability of the existing social order .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.18416"}
