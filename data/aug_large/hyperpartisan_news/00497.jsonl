{"text": "He said Goodwill treated him well so he decided not to sue .At Custom Food Inc. exposure to spices caused sinus problems for an Ethiopian refugee who has allergies .He requested to switch jobs but Bridge 's employment coordinator refused to help him .Finally , at Propak Logistics ' pallets repair section many Iraqi refugees reported injuries for years to Bridge 's employment coordinator but the coordinator ignored their complaints and sided with the company against the refugees .Bridge has arranged work via Express Employment ( and Adico ) , for whom the refugees work .Many refugees sign papers not knowing what they are signing ; some do not read English .Under this arrangement with Express a factory pays $ 9 per hour but refugees only get a bit more than $ 7 per hour .The work is unstable , with refugees working a week and then being off a week .A former case manager also sent us information about the agency and pointed out that the refugee employment figures are dishonest as most of the refuges have only temporary employment that does not help them to pay rent and be self - sufficient .The nature of the temp jobs also means that the refugees will be unemployed just a short time after the agency reports them employed to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement ( ORR ) at 90 days and 180 days .( This , however , is a problem throughout the refugee program , and it does n't seem that the the ORR has much of an interest in requiring that resettlement agencies report if refugees are working at temporary or non - temporary jobs . )The agency then takes the refugees to their apartments and gives flawed home safety orientation involving just pointing to things and turning things on and off in an attempt to show them how things work .It then takes weeks before they find an interpreter .When the case manager voiced his concerns about this to the office manager she responded that it was case managers ' responsibility to bring an interpreter .He asked her how he could use one that is not contracted .She said they would look into but that it was his responsibility to get one and that it was okay to have a volunteer interpreter .These refugees do n't receive proper attention because nobody can communicate with them .The African refugees compared services the agency was giving them to other refugees and realized they were receiving fewer services and less attention in all areas .As a result , when the African refugees started their own organization to help their own community they refused to work with Bridge .The case manager points out that the Bridge office in Chattanooga is more organized than the office in Knoxville due to the qualifications , dedication and experience of the office coordinator in Chattanooga .She comes in everyday at 8:30 am and leaves at 4:30 pm unlike the one in Knoxville who comes in at 9 am or 10 am and sneaks out around 2pm-3pm yet submits weekly time sheets indicating 40 hours of work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.99428"}
