{"text": "Similar to Article 50 the accession clause in Lisbon - Article 49 -also does not mention specifically the need for a new Treaty .Yet if a country applies to join the EU a new treaty is ultimately required for precisely the same reasons as leaving - that it requires amendments to the founding treaties .A recent example is the Treaty of Accession 2011 concerning Croatia 's accession to the EU which comes into force 1stJuly 2013 .Under Article 49 a country formally applies for membership , then begins a period of negotiation mainly based on whether the country wishing to apply is able to sufficiently execute EU law .This process would be remarkably similar to Article 50 but obviously for opposite intentions .The UK would formally notify intentions to leave , negotiate , and then sign the resulting treaty which is ratified by the EU and all Member States .Those countries wishing to join the EU have the option of saying no by changing their minds if the terms are n't right , those countries wishing to leave have the option of saying no by not accepting the withdrawal agreement if the terms are n't right .One quirk with Article 50 though is as a member of the EU - the European Council and the Council of the EU - the UK would ending up sitting on both sides of the negotiating table regarding the new treaty .So this is where Article 50 ( 4 ) comes in ( my emphasis ) : .For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3 , the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it .This is entirely logical otherwise the UK would end up negotiating with itself .This exclusion is entirely consistent to Article 49 where accession countries are also absent from the European Council and the Council ... by virtue of not yet being EU members .In summary Article 50 allows us to fulfill our international obligations , abide by our EU treaty agreements and allows for an orderly exit with minimum of disruption particularly with regarding trade .40 responses to \" Article 50 And Withdrawal \" .I disagree .Article 50 is a trap .Let me go back to the beginning ; I always bristle when people talk of Britain 's ' relationship ' with the EU , as though the EU were something ' over there ' external from the UK .That might have been the case prior to Lisbon , when the former European Union to which we belonged was merely an agreement between sovereign nations .But the Lisbon Treaty has created a nenw country called Europe , of which we are a mere province .We no more have a ' relationship ' with the EU than Ohio has a relationship with the USA .The reason there was no ' exit clause ' in the ' old ' EU was that it was not necessary .We could , as a sovereign partner , simply have repealed the 1972 European Communities Act , by which we acceded to the Treaty of Rome , and with one bound we would have been free .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.158546"}
{"text": "He would probably be replaced by a more eurosceptic leader who might actively campaign to pull Britain out of the EU .The final reason why Scoxit might lead to Brexit is linked to Cameron 's strategy of renegotiating Britain 's relationship with the EU before holding an In / Out referendum .He hopes to use the concessions he has won as a strong reason for voting to stay in .The problem is that , if Scotland votes for independence , there will then be a messy argument over the divorce terms .Brussels will also need to negotiate the terms of Scotland 's admission to the EU , which wo n't be easy either .Will both London and Brussels be able to focus on renegotiating their own relationship when they are tied up bargaining with Edinburgh ?There has to be a risk that they wo n't and that , therefore , Cameron 's strategy of going to the electorate with a new deal on Europe in 2017 will be in tatters .That , in turn , would make it harder for the \" in \" campaign to win a referendum .In other words , Salmond may be as big a risk to Britain 's EU membership as Farage .That Labour governments in the UK depend on Scotland being a part of the Union is purely myth and it is a myth that a supposedly responsible news organisation has NO business repeating as though it were true .Only three times have Scottish in the past have MPs made any difference in the outcome of a British General Election .Other than that your reference to Scoxit and Brexit are silly , your basic premise is deeply , deeply flawed .And for that matter if the people of Scotland want to withdraw from the UK , it is their right and their business .The same must be said about the UK withdrawing from the EU and proposing that Scotland should prevent EWNI from expressing their democratic will is appalling .As an American , I do n't really have a right to an opinion on either Scottish independence or Brexit , but it 's difficult to avoid having questions when hearing about these things .First , I really do n't understand how Scotland could become better off by leaving Great Britain .I saw clips of a recent speech by Alex Salmond in which he was summing up his case for Scottish independence , and it all appeared based on emotion and nostalgia rather than practical considerations .I confess that I , too , prefer Robert Burns to William Wordsworth , but I do n't see how that kind of preference should affect important political and economic decisions .As for Brexit , it 's easy to see why some Brits are seeing EU membership as a pair of lead boots .But it sure sounds like David Cameron 's approach to the problem is very practical .On one hand , he 's telling Europe that Britain may have to leave the EU if they ca n't fix the Britain - Europe relationship .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.778076"}

{"text": "We also asked for an examination of how the UK might fit into the fresh geopolitical and economic landscape that would follow .Forty years ago , Labour prime minister Harold Wilson made a manifesto pledge for a referendum on whether to remain in the EEC .This was held in June 1975 - the last time the British people had a say on their relationship with what has now become the European Union .In the 2005 general election , all three major parties promised a referendum on whether to ratify the EU Constitution , yet no referendum has since been forthcoming .Voters could therefore be forgiven for being cynical when promised they will be asked for their views at some date in the future .But there is a head of steam building up that will become difficult to resist .Democracy is the space within which the people express their will .And , on Europe , voters want their say , not just in European elections , but also on the nature of the relationship itself .Yet if you ask people for their views on \" in \" or \" out \" , you owe it to them to provide choices as to what that will mean .Polls show that the majority of the British public favour a reformed EU over exit or maintaining the status quo .But , as yet , we are unclear what these mean in practice and what the consequences of a particular choice would be in reality .Even if the British government were n't to do anything from here , the rest of the EU knows it has to make significant institutional changes to deal with the fallout from its unstable currency .The EU member states will divide into those who are in the euro , those who are not yet in the euro and those who have no intention of joining the euro .Likewise , if doing nothing still means change , then pulling out does not mean simply rewinding the clocks to 1973 .The Brexit Prize is therefore an important first step towards bringing some light to the debate .This is quite a task .It involves the sheer complexities of negotiations within the EU as well as the unpredictability of the political environment in which this will take place .But Iain Mansfield 's winning entry assesses these issues in detail , arguing that the most important consideration in renegotiation would be to ensure the maintenance of zero tariffs on trade between the UK and the EU in all areas apart from agriculture .Mr Mansfield suggests UK membership of the European Free Trade Area , while remaining outside the European Economic Area , and hence giving us the ability to repeal significant amounts of single - market regulation .This would see us somewhere between the positions of Switzerland and Turkey .Equally important , though , is to map out what Britain 's place in the world would be .There 's much more detail on the reforms necessary to UK government , the sticking points we are likely to encounter , the regulations we could abolish and the risks we face .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.894474"}

{"text": "Test .I will spare my readers of most of the details , just give a quick summary .First we come to the , very well funded , BBC who breathlessly reports this on 17th January : .Strangely enough there 's not one quote in the BBC piece that backs its assertions up and seems instead to be based on this : .When asked if he could guarantee the club could avoid administration , Patey responded : \" Not a single chairman in the country could do that . \"Still , it feeds into the lazy narrative that Swindon has had a long and dubious history of financial problems .Yet since a successful takeover in 2008 it does n't owe a penny to creditors who are knocking on the door , does n't have an overdraft , does n't owe the taxman .The main creditor is Swindon 's owner Andrew Black and it exists in the form of soft debt of his own money .Swindon 's current situation is that Mr Black , the main shareholder , for personal reasons has decided to sell , and it 's been that position for many months .But the BBC , in their wisdom , ran with Swindon financial ' crisis ' story , picking up on a quote which was taken out of context .As a result it has lead to constant accusations from other media outlets that are of a very untrue nature .No wonder Swindon Town received an apology and damages from the Football League Paper , for blatant libel .And now today the Daily Mail has this : .A DEAL has been reached which will see Swindon Town taken over by a consortium led by Jed McCrory subject to Football League approval , the Advertiser understands .It is believed that the new owners and the current board , led by Andrew Black , will hold joint responsibility in the running of the club until the deal is ratified by the authorities .Still , \" a powerful reputation for accuracy \" is what the media has , despite that you get a far more accurate picture of what 's going on from a humble internet forum .Update : Just simply marvellous : .Today 's report in the Daily Mail which suggested Swindon Town 's players were all up for sale and that the club was about to be plunged into administration appears to have been the result of an erroneous email .The Advertiser has learnt that an agent issued the missive , which intimated that every member of the Town squad was available for transfer , last night .The Adver has also been told that several agents have been claiming to represent players who are not their clients .As documented on this blog recently Iceland has been involved with one of biggest rejections of the EU there has ever been by an EEA member , one which centred around two legal arguments , over the collapse of Icesave .This has been an ongoing legal battle until the judgement today .After the collapse four years ago of Iceland 's top lenders during the credit crunch , the British and Dutch governments stepped in to repay savers in the online \" Icesave \" account run by Landsbanki and wanted Iceland to pay them back directly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.89257"}

'Lady Thatcher .Sadly among the New Year celebrations , we must note that today is 40th anniversary of one of the biggest mistakes this country has ever made in its history - entry to what was then the EEC ( euphemistically called a Common Market ) .The EEC was nothing but a staging post onto the final goal of full political and economic union .Britain was joining a project that was designed to eradicate democracy and sovereignty .Despite Heath 's assertions that , \" there is no question of Britain losing essential national sovereignty \" , the politicians at the time , particularly Heath , were well aware this was not true and kept the true nature of the project hidden from the British public .And so began the underlying characteristic of our membership - monumental deceit ; lied to on entry , lied to during membership and lied to about the nature of exit .Thankfully though there seems to be light ahead , as there now appears a significant shift in the mood music if not momentum .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.81727"}
