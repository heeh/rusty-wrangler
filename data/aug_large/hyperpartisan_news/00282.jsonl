{"text": "The following year , facing an imminent Supreme Court hearing about whether Americans may be detained without charges , Bush had Padilla moved out of a military brig , and federal prosecutors indicted him on unrelated terrorism support charges in South Florida .He was convicted .But the sensational accusations Comey made at the Justice Department in 2004 were dropped .Comey became a hero to Democrats for the central role he played in holding up Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program , one of the administration 's great controversies and an episode that focused attention on the administration 's controversial tactics in the war on terror .In dramatic testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007 , Comey said he thought Bush 's no - warrant wiretapping program was so questionable that Comey refused for a time to reauthorize it , leading to a standoff with White House officials at the hospital bedside of an ailing Ashcroft .Comey said he refused to recertify the program because Ashcroft had reservations about its legality .Senior government officials had expressed concerns about whether the National Security Agency , which administered the warrantless eavesdropping program , had the proper oversight in place .Other concerns included whether any president possessed the legal and constitutional authority to authorize the program as it was carried out at the time .Comey was deputy attorney general in 2005 when he unsuccessfully tried to limit tough interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists .He told then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that some of the practices were wrong and would damage the department 's reputation .Some Democrats denounced those methods as torture , particularly the use of waterboarding , which produces the sensation of drowning .Earlier in his career , Comey served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York , one of the nation 's most prominent prosecutorial offices and one at the front lines of terrorism , corporate malfeasance , organized crime and the war on drugs .As an assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia , Comey handled the investigation of the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers housing complex near Dhahran , Saudi Arabia , which killed 19 U.S. military personnel .He led the Justice Department 's corporate fraud task force and spurred the creation of violent crime impact teams in 20 cities , focusing on crimes committed with guns .If nominated , Comey is likely to get a warm greeting from at least one member of the Judiciary Committee - Sen. Amy Klobuchar , D - Minn .When Comey testified on June 8 , 2011 , about extending Mueller 's term , Klobuchar said in her introduction that she and Comey were in the \" same law school class , graduated together and we 've known each other for a long time . \"Customer Service : ( 815 ) 459 - 8118 or toll - free ( 800 ) 589 - 9363 Copyright \u00a9 2016 Northwest Herald .All rights reserved .Published in Crystal Lake , Illinois , USA , by Shaw Media .See how easy building a mobile - friendly website can be with Shaw Media Digital Senate approves James Comey as new FBI director .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.788055"}

Bush in 1988 , Al Gore in 2000 and Walter Mondale , a former vice president , in 1984 had built - in advantages within the party that helped them get their respective party 's nominations .Some vice presidents , for one reason or another , have decided they did n't want the career advancement .Dan Quayle , a former V.P. , skipped the 1996 race entirely ( though he did make an ultimately unsuccessful bid for 2000 ) .Dick Cheney made it clear from the beginning that he had no desire to succeed George W. Bush in 2008 .Spiro Agnew , of course , had legal distractions that kept him out of the 1976 campaign .The only vice president in recent history who wanted to get his party 's nomination and succeed his retiring boss - but failed - was Alben Barkley .The number two under Harry Truman and a former Senate majority leader , Barkley made himself available for the nomination after Truman surprised the nation by taking himself out of the running in 1952 , after losing the New Hampshire primary .But Barkley , who was 74 years old and in office for four decades , was dismissed as \" too old \" by many in the party , and that was the judgment from organized labor as well .The Democrats ultimately chose Adlai Stevenson .By most accounts , Joe Biden would love to succeed Barack Obama .He of course has some of the problems that crippled Barkley ; he will also be 74 years old in the next campaign .No one that old has ever been elected president .Ronald Reagan was 73 when he ran for a second term in 1984 , a campaign where his age became a key issue .Bob Dole was 73 when he challenged President Clinton in 1996 and John McCain was 72 when he ran against Obama in 2008 .Biden has also run for president twice before , in the 1988 and 2008 cycles , and did n't exactly bowl anyone over in either attempt .The first time he did n't even survive 1987 , and the second he was gone before New Hampshire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.282154"}
