{"text": "Browse Archives .WASHINGTON - A woman who accused Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain of sexual harassment Thursday offered a statement for the National Restaurant Association to review telling her side of the story , in a move that could further undermine his 2012 campaign .Cain has been accused by at least three women of sexual harassment when he headed the restaurant group in the mid-1990s .The issue is dominating the race to decide a Republican challenger to face Democratic President Barack Obama in the November 2012 election .Meanwhile , Politico , which originally broke the story Sunday , reported this evening that one of the women 's accusations propelled urgent discussions at top levels of the association within hours of when the incident was alleged to have occurred .She was livid and lodged a verbal complaint with an NRA board member that same night , these sources said .The woman told one of the sources Cain made a suggestion that she felt was overtly sexual in nature and that ' she perceived that her job was at risk if she did n't do it , ' \" according to the Politico report .The candidate himself continues to rebut the allegations .This is absolutely fabrication , man , \" Cain told conservative talk radio host Sean Hannity , adding later : \" We 're not going to get distracted .As of today we 're back on message and we 're going to stay on message .One of the women said earlier this week that she wanted to talk publicly about accusations that Cain had sexually harassed her , but she has since changed her mind and wanted to make a written statement through her lawyer .The woman 's lawyer , Joel Bennett , gave the statement to the restaurant group , said Sue Hensley , a spokeswoman for the restaurant association .The trade group 's lawyers were reviewing the statement to decide whether to lift a confidentiality agreement that she signed when she left the association .It is likely to conflict with Cain 's version of events .We are currently reviewing the document , and we plan to respond tomorrow , \" Hensley , of the association , said .Details of the woman 's statement would likely put further pressure on Cain , 65 , a former pizza executive who has headed polls of Republican contenders in recent weeks .Hannity asked Cain about comments from a conservative Iowa radio host who said Cain subjected two of his female staff members to \" inappropriate and awkward \" comments .If speaking to somebody is sexual harassment , give me a break , \" Cain said , sounding exasperated .\" All I do is speak to people everywhere I go and even though they are the receptionists , I treat them with respect by saying hello .Cain complained of his treatment by the U.S. news media after spending most of this week in the glare of the Washington press corps , giving conflicting accounts of the case and accusing rival Rick Perry of instigating the controversy to derail his surging campaign .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.012085"}

{"text": "Sexual Harassment on Campus : It 's a Guy Thing .Macho culture is driving boys to bully and harass , writes Hugo Schwyzer .The American Association of University Women today released the first major study of sexual harassment in schools in over a decade .This is the first such research to be done since the advent of of the social media ( Facebook , Twitter , Tumblr ) that is so much a part of teens ' lives .The study ( available in its entirety here in PDF format ) paints a sobering picture of what junior high and high school students endure today .The researchers found that boys remain the primary perpetrators of sexual harassment .This goes against the media depiction of \" mean girls \" as the agents of so much of suffering on high school campuses .Boys were much more likely to harass : .A majority of harassed students ( 54 percent ) identified one male student as their harasser , and 12 percent of harassed students said that they were harassed by a group of male students .In contrast , only 14 percent of students said the harasser was one female student , and 5 percent said that they were harassed by a group of female students .Not surprisingly , girls are much more likely to be the ones harassed : Girls were more likely than boys to be sexually harassed , by a significant margin ( 56 percent versus 40 percent ) .Girls were more likely than boys to be sexually harassed both in person ( 52 percent versus 35 percent ) and via text , e - mail , Facebook , or other electronic means ( 36 percent versus 24 percent ) .As dramatic as these statistics are , they do n't mean that every boy harasses , or that boys are never harassed by girls .But this brand - new study is a reminder that anti - bullying programs that do n't address adolescent masculine culture as the primary culprit are missing the mark .What drives sexual harassment is n't testosterone .Boys are not born to harass .What enables and encourages so many of them to harass girls and other boys are the \" rules of manhood \" that prize cruelty , swagger , and aggression .Boys who are shamed out of crying and who are shamed out of forming close friendships with girls are \" set up \" to become bullies and harassers .They use words ( and worse ) to enforce a strict Guy Code among other boys .( The study found , not surprisingly , that male - on - male harassment tends to employ homophobic language . )And they harass girls to win attention and praise from other boys - and to feel the thrill of power over vulnerable young women .The AAUW report is a dramatic reminder that the problems of bullying and harassment are heavily gendered : most of the time , it 's about what boys do to girls and to each other .This does n't mean , of course , that boys are inherently bad .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.68967"}

( tied for the most for any single studio ) .Scientific Approach .Later , Miramax also began to invest in more expensive , prestigious films - but again , it appears they did so with some rules in mind , viewing the marketplace differently from their competitors .Miramax instead used the modest success of Merchant - Ivory films to build another heuristic : take material with a built - in audience , geared to women , then ditch the corsets to get men in to see the movie too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.622986"}
