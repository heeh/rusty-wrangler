Bloomberg , decided on July 9 .New York City charges $ 340 for a three - year gun license .Second Amendment advocates argue that this fee violates the Constitution .It does not , the Second Circuit ( Cabranes , Walker and Wesley ) says .The Court borrows from our First Amendment cases in deciding whether licensing fees violate the Constitution .Under the First Amendment , if you want to hold a parade , the government can charge you a licensing fee to defray the administrative costs associated with processing the application and maintaining public order .Same goes for Second Amendment cases .While the $ 340 licensing fee is significantly more money than that charged by by other jurisdictions , that grievance is irrelevant .What 's relevant is that it costs New York City about $ 340 to defray the administrative costs of processing gun license applications .The plaintiffs also claim that the licensing fee imposes an unconstitutional burden on gun ownership .In order to resolve this issue , the Court of Appeals has to decide what level of scrutiny to apply .If the Court applies heightened scrutiny , the government has a much harder time in defending the law .Under rational basis review , anything goes .Finally , the plaintiffs sue under the Equal Protection Clause because state law allows New York City and Nassau County to set their own licensing fees separate and apart from the rest of the state .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.20445"}

{"text": "I do , however , want to add a point to Jonathan 's analysis : The very need to address this issue is a sign of the second class status of property rights .For most other constitutional rights , there is already well - established Supreme Court precedent holding that it is unconstitutional for the government to punish people for exercising those rights .For example , prosecutors can not punish defendants for exercising their Fifth Amendment right to remain silent .Government officials are forbidden to harass citizens for exercising their free speech rights or their rights to practice their religion .The actions that the federal Bureau of Land Management officials allegedly took to punish Frank Robbins for refusing to give the BLM an easement over his land would clearly be unconstitutional if used to punish him for exercising virtually any other constitutional right .As R.S. Radford and Tim Sandefur point out : . [BLM ] agents ordered Robbins to sign over the easement , and when he refused , they grew belligerent .\" The federal government does n't negotiate , \" one official told him .Instead , they promised that Robbins ' refusal would \" come to war \" and that they would give him a \" hardball education .\" Then they began a vendetta against him that would last to the present day .They cancelled his right of way over government - owned land , repeatedly harassed the guests at his ranch , cited him for minor infractions while letting similar violations by his neighbors go unnoticed , and brought him up on criminal charges of interfering with federal agents during their duties .The jury acquitted him after deliberating for less than 30 minutes .Everyone agrees that these rights would be worthless , or at least gravely impaired , if government could punish people for exercising them .The same point applies to citizens ' constitutional right to avoid uncompensating takings of their property in violation of the Fifth Amendment .Note that this issue is separable from the question of the substantive scope of constitutional property rights .Even if you believe that the scope of constitutional property rights should be very narrow , there is still good reason to forbid the government from punishing people for exercising those ( admittedly narrow ) rights .UPDATE : I recognize that , as explained in the SCOTUS Blog , there are two other issues in the case unrelated to the one I focus on here .That , however , does n't undermine my main point .UPDATE # 2 : Some commenters are fixated on the specific facts of this case and on the question of whether Robbins behaved badly .However , as with most Supreme Court cases , the important issues are not the specific details of this case , but the broader legal rule that will be established .If the BLM wins on the issue addressed in the post , ALL constitutional property rights will be denied protection from government retaliation , not just those belonging to owners who behave obnoxiously in some way .Moreover , as a procedural matter , the only issue before the Supreme Court is that of whether or not Robbins ' case against the BLM should be dismissed on summary judgment ( i.e. - without going to trial ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.88914"}

Ernst & Young , LLP , decided on August 9 .Southerland is the lead plaintiff in this class action that alleges that Ernst & Young denied its employees overtime pay under the FLSA .She calculates that her former employer shafted her out of 151.5 hours of overtime , amounting to $ 1,867.02 in lost overtime pay .Southerland would also sue on behalf of others who were also denied overtime pay .But when she began working there , Southerland signed an agreement that said that disputes like this will be resolved at arbitration .The agreement also says that these disputes \" pertaining to different employees will be heard in separate proceedings . \"In other words , no class actions in arbitration .Nothwithstanding the arbitration agreement , the district court cited In Re American Express Merchants ' Litigation , 554 F.3d 300 ( 2d Cir .2009 ) in holding that Southerland could bring this proposed class action in federal court .The rationale is that where it does n't pay for the individual plaintiff to bring a suit like this , then the arbitration agreement 's prohibition against class actions is not enforceable .Also , enforcing the arbitration agreement would deprive the plaintiffs of their substantive rights under federal law .Great news for Southerland .But in June 2013 , the Supreme Court overturned the American Express case , 133 S.Ct .2304 ( 2013 ) , and said that it does not matter if the individual arbitration is cost - prohibitive .If the arbitration agreement that the employee signed says that the labor dispute goes to arbitration , then it goes to arbitration .Bad news for Southerland .That ruling compels the Second Circuit ( Winter , Cabranes and Straub ) to reverse the district court in this case and hold that Southerland can not bring this class action .Southerland has a relatively small claim , seeking less than $ 1,900 in damages .Many lawyers would not take the case .The lawsuit would not be worth it unless the case is a class action on behalf of many other employees .This means that her rights may go unenforced .But the Supreme Court rejected that argument in June 2013 , stating that \" the fact that it is not worth the expense involving in proving a statutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue that remedy .\" The Court of Appeals is taking a hard look at FLSA cases , reminding us once again that plaintiffs who allege that they were illegally denied overtime pay have to clarify what exactly happened to them .Otherwise , the case is dismissed under Rule 12 .This is the third in a series of recent decisions by this Court addressing the question of the adequacy of pleadings alleging that defendant health - care companies failed to pay their employees for overtime work as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.96593"}
