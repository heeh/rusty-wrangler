Enterprises , Inc. , 498 U.S. at 297 .The question is , should the government have an analogous power in intelligence investigations , and if so , what is exactly is the intelligence analogy to traditional criminal grand jury subpoena authority ?On one hand , it makes some sense to give the government that power : if the government has long had the power to issue subpoenas in minor crime cases , it seems a bit strange that they do n't have this same power in terrorism cases .In that sense , giving the FBI administrative subpoena power simply recognizes the historically contingent limitations on the grand jury power .At the same time , it 's not clear that FBI administrative subpoena power would really be analogous to the grand jury power .If an FBI agent wants a subpoena , he still needs to go to a prosecutor ; the proseuctor issues the subpoena in the name of the grand jury .This introduces one important check on the system , as the investigative agency can not issue the grand jury subpoena itself .If you want the FBI to be tempered in its efforts by the check of another agency , administrative subpoena authority can seem troublesome .But once again , this depends on your frame of reference .More civil libertarian readers will object to the subpoena power , and argue that we should judge orders to compel evidence ( category # 2 ) based on the legal standards that traditionally govern orders to conduct direct searches ( category # 1 ) .The subpoena power will seem like an end - run around the usual protections .At the same time , other readers may take the opposite frame of reference , and note that many agencies have had administrative subpoena power already , as detailed in this very good report from the Congressional Research Service .If lots of agencies have this power already , they 'll reason , why not give it to the FBI for the most important of investigations ?As this inconclusive post suggests , I 'm not sure of where I come out on the bottom line .On one hand , I do think that the regime of intelligence investigation needs some kind of subpoena equivalent .I do n't see why intelligence investigations are different on that score .At the same time , I 'm not sure that giving the FBI administrative subpoena authority is the way to go .While a number of agencies have such power , they tend to have more limited scope .My initial sense is that there must be ways of increasing oversight beyond that of administrative subpoenas without interfering with their effectiveness as investigative tools .I hope Congress takes a hard look at them before giving the FBI administrative subpoena authority .The Case for and Against Administrative Subpoenas : Michael Woods , a very smart lawyer who was at the FBI when I was at DOJ , makes the case for giving the FBI administrative subpoena power in terrorism cases in this op - ed today in the Washington Times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.92558"}

Edgar Hoover , was \" to expose , disrupt , misdirect , discredit , or otherwise neutralize activities \" of those individuals and organizations whose ideas or goals he opposed .In 1983 , Attorney General William French Smith issued superseding guidelines that authorized \" domestic security/ terrorism \" investigations against political organizations whenever the FBI had a reasonable belief that these groups might violate a law .The new guidelines permitted the same intrusive techniques the FBI used against organized crime .The Smith guidelines were justified by the Attorney General 's observation that \" our citizens are no less threatened by groups which engage in criminal violence for political ... purposes that by those which operate lawlessly for financial gain . \"He concluded : \" we must ensure that criminal intelligence resources that have been brought to bear so effectively in organized crime and racketeering investigations are effectively employed in domestic security/ terrorism cases .\" The guidelines provide , therefore , no safeguards to protect against infringements of First Amendment rights .Worst , they ignore the history of COINTELPRO abuses , and abolish the distinction between regular criminal investigations and investigations of groups and individuals seeking political change .They fail to limit the investigative techniques used to obtain data on political groups , so that now the FBI may use any technique , including electronic surveillance and informers , against political organizations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.627144"}

Levi .Criticized by liberals and conservatives alike , the guidelines were issued in the wake of a Congressional committee 's report of highly questionable activities by the FBI : monitoring the activities of domestic political groups seeking to effect change .The report exposed the FBI 's counter - intelligence program ( COINTELPRO ) under which the agency infiltrated groups , compiled dossiers on , and directly interfered with individuals engaged in activities protected by the First Amendment rights to freedom of expression and association .The FBI COINTELPRO program was initiated in 1956 .Its purpose , as described later by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover , was \" to expose , disrupt , misdirect , discredit , or otherwise neutralize activities \" of those individuals and organizations whose ideas or goals he opposed .In 1983 , Attorney General William French Smith issued superseding guidelines that authorized \" domestic security/ terrorism \" investigations against political organizations whenever the FBI had a reasonable belief that these groups might violate a law .The new guidelines permitted the same intrusive techniques the FBI used against organized crime .The Smith guidelines were justified by the Attorney General 's observation that \" our citizens are no less threatened by groups which engage in criminal violence for political ... purposes that by those which operate lawlessly for financial gain . \"He concluded : \" we must ensure that criminal intelligence resources that have been brought to bear so effectively in organized crime and racketeering investigations are effectively employed in domestic security/ terrorism cases .\" The guidelines provide , therefore , no safeguards to protect against infringements of First Amendment rights .Worst , they ignore the history of COINTELPRO abuses , and abolish the distinction between regular criminal investigations and investigations of groups and individuals seeking political change .They fail to limit the investigative techniques used to obtain data on political groups , so that now the FBI may use any technique , including electronic surveillance and informers , against political organizations .The FBI has interpreted \" force or violence \" to include the destruction of property as a symbolic act , and the mere advocacy of such property destruction would trigger an investigation .Even without any reasonable indication , under a separate guideline on \" Civil Disorders and Demonstrations Involving a Federal Interest , \" the FBI may investigate an organization that plans only legal and peaceful demonstrations .Another set of rules governing federal intelligence gathering is Executive Order 12333 , in force since 1981 .It authorizes the FBI and CIA to infiltrate , manipulate and destroy U.S.political organizations , as well as to use electronic surveillance -- under the pretext of an international intelligence investigation .What federal agencies are likely to be interested in a citizen 's political activities and affiliations ?The FBI is still the major national intelligence - gathering agency .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.80061"}

James Traficant ( D - Ohio ) dated January 13 , 1998 , Tenet acknowledges that more than forty changes were made to the video animation at the NTSB 's suggestion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.716"}

{"text": "State Investigations by Local Police and the Connecticut Attorney General 's Office .On the state level , criminal investigations are not cloaked in such secrecy ; however , if you have not been arrested , then the police have no legal obligation to share information with you about who and what they are investigating .The way Connecticut police gather evidence is through search warrants , police and detective interviews , and surveillance .The Connecticut Attorney General 's Office also regularly issues subpoenas to individuals and businesses in the State in connection with many of their consumer protection cases and contractor fraud investigations .They often work arm - in - arm with local police agencies to execute search warrants and serve subpoenas so if you receive a witness subpoena from the Attorney General 's Office , it is a good idea to consult a Connecticut witness representation lawyer before responding .Be ready for pushback - the officer may say that you do n't need a lawyer , that you 're not a suspect , or that you will only be making it harder on yourself or your family if you delay the interview .Do n't be intimidated .Anything you say to a police officer can and will be used against you so it 's always a good idea to hire a Greenwich or Stamford criminal lawyer to assist you with witness representation .Subpoenas and Deposition Requests in Connecticut Divorce Cases & Civil Lawsuits .In addition to needing to consult a lawyer prior to participating in a federal , state or SEC investigation , many of our clients have hired us to defend and protect them in their role as witnesses in messy divorce actions .Aggressive divorce lawyers like to apply \" scorched earth \" discovery tactics against their adversary , which oftentimes results in everyone around a divorcing party getting subpoenaed to appear for a deposition or divorce trial , with onerous document requests being slapped on these witnesses to boot .Know that just because a litigant in a civil action asks for documents does not mean you , as the witness , must produce them .You have legal rights to push back and object to these requests based on grounds of harassment , intimidation , burden and cost .So if you have received a witness subpoena for deposition or trial in a Connecticut divorce action , consider hiring a top Connecticut witness lawyer to help you fight back , and possibly quash and suppress the subpoena and its respective document requests .Contact a Connecticut Witness Representation Lawyer Today .We assist witnesses at the state and federal level .We do not let our witnesses get pushed around , and we will aggressively work within legal parameters to attempt to end your involvement in the case and bring closure as quickly as possible .Availability : .If an Agent Knocks .Federal Investigators and Your Rights Center for Constitutional Rights .Background 1 .What is Political Intelligence ?Do I have to talk to the FBI ?Under what laws do the agents operate ?What federal agencies are likely to be interested in a citizen 's political activities and affiliations ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.988144"}
