{"text": "\" While traveling through Europe and the UK for extended periods of time , I 've often been quite envious of how respectful other countries are toward those with knowledge in the fields of science and the humanities .In the UK , for example , it 's generally not seen as \" uncool \" to have a higher degree from a good university .Often , it confers the degree - holder a certain social respect and admiration .Many of the top comedians in the UK have attended institutions like Oxford and Cambridge , including Michael Palin , Eric Idol , John Cleese , David Mitchell , Richard Ayoade and Stephen Fry .And shows such as \" QI , \" which combines academic discussions with uproarious , irreverent humor , are popular hits .Not only is the U.S. unique for its love affair with anti - intellectualism , but this romantic relationship appears to have grown stronger over the past few decades .A primary reason for this is no doubt the huge influence that conservative media have had on American culture , such as Fox News , which is currently the most trusted news network in the country .The problem is that \" Fox News \" is a misnomer .The network is , to quote Jon Stewart , more of a \" relentlessly activist \" organization for conservative causes than an intellectually honest conveyor of information .Indeed , there are to date at least seven academic studies that have found that Fox News ' viewership constitutes the most misinformed audience out there .From climate change to healthcare , the Iraq War to the country of Obama 's birth ( no , it 's not Kenya ) , denizens of Fox News are more confident about falsehoods than viewers of any other news network .Several studies even found a positive correlation between how often one watches Fox News and the degree to which one 's worldview is misinformed .What 's most dangerous about Fox News , though , is n't its cynical use of Orwellian doublespeak , as in \" Fair and Balanced \" and \" No Spin Zone , \" to conceal a conservative agenda .Nor is it the network 's repeated failure to accurately report the facts .Rather , the most dangerous consequence of Fox News is that it discourages that most important form of rigorous curiosity called critical thinking .If people want a single phenomenon to blame for the gradual decline of the American empire , direct your wagging finger at the devaluation of critical thinking skills .It 's not an accident that Fox News wants an audience that isn ' t preoccupied with carefully dissecting complex social , political , economic and religious issues .Critical thinking is perhaps our very best strategy for apprehending the true nature of reality , and as the great comedian Stephen Colbert once declared , \" reality has a well - known liberal bias . \"In other words , critical thinking could lead to liberalism - or worse , to that most dreaded form of liberal fanaticism called secular progressivism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.5028"}

{"text": "Background Going back to high school , Don Black has always been one of the more enthusiastic proponents of white power .One of his first forays into the organized movement was in the 1970s , when he volunteered for the late white supremacist J.B. Stoner 's unsuccessful run for governor of Georgia .He stayed with the campaign until Stoner 's campaign manager , Jerry Ray , the brother of Martin Luther King Jr. assassin James Earl Ray , shot Black in the chest .The shooting apparently stemmed from accusations that Black had broken into Stoner 's office to steal a mailing list for the National Socialist White People 's Party .After recovering , Black went on to join the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan , the group headed by David Duke in the 1970s .Working on Duke 's unsuccessful campaign for Louisiana state Senate , Black won Duke 's trust , moving up to become his mentor 's right - hand man in addition to his post as Alabama grand dragon , or state leader .When Duke left the group amid allegations that he 'd tried to sell its membership list to another Klan group for $ 35,000 , Black took over .Later , in the 1970s , according to The Crusader , a KKK newspaper , Black sponsored marches in defense of Robert Chambliss , who stood accused ( and was later convicted ) of the 1963 church bombing that killed four black girls in Birmingham , Ala.Not long after , Black got into trouble himself .In 1981 , he and nine other white supremacists were arrested as they prepared to board a yacht with which they intended to invade the tiny Caribbean island of Dominica , oust its black - run government , and transform it into a \" white state . \" Black 's resulting three - year federal prison sentence was time well spent .He took classes in computer programming that would provide the basis for his future .Not long after his release , Black launched an unsuccessful campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from Alabama .He wound up marrying Duke 's ex - wife , Chloe Hardin , and moving to West Palm Beach , Fla.Once there , he began dabbling with his computer , eventually setting up a dial - up bulletin board service for the radical right .By March 1995 , that service evolved into Stormfront.org , the Net 's first ever and best - known American hate site .Black saw clearly that with this new technology , white supremacists might finally bypass the mainstream media and political apparatus , getting their message out to people who otherwise would never hear it .And he realized the importance of the fact that people who now could read about white supremacist ideas in the privacy of their own homes without fear of embarrassment or reproach .\" The potential of the Net for organizations and movements such as ours is enormous , \" Black told a reporter in 1996 .\" We 're reaching tens of thousands of people who never before had access to our point of view .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.181015"}

{"text": "How does Bryant 's extension affect the Lakers ' cap room and their quest to help Kobe win another championship to tie Michael Jordan 's 6 championships ?Using their views , let 's take a look at the Lakers ' current salary cap situation for this off - season .Lakers ' Current Salary Cap Situation .As Larry Coon noted , the Lakers currently have Kobe Bryant , Steve Nash , and Robert Sacre on books for next season , while Elias Harris has a non - guaranteed contract and Nick Young has a player option next season .The Lakers will also have a 1st round draft pick , which would fall to the 15th pick if season ended today at a cap hit of about $ 1.5 million .Here is the scenario that Larry Coon gives the Lakers to work with : .\" If they remove both [ Elias ] Harris and [ Steve ] Nash , their team salary will drop to about $ 34.44 million , which would give them about $ 28.46 million in cap room .This would give them the opportunity to sign one maximum - salary player , and a second player at around the mid - level amount .They would also be eligible to utilize the Room Mid - Level exception for around $ 2.7 million .\" Now , let 's say the Lakers use the Room Mid - Level exception on current SG Jodie Meeks , who is averaging 13.3 PPG and shooting 47.7 % from behind the three - point line this season .Also , lets assume the Lakers re - sign PG Jordan Farmar and F Wesley Johnson to veteran minimum deals .According to Eric Pincus , \" Their cap holds will be just $ 915,243 next summer ... the Lakers can negotiate small ( 7.5 % ) raises for each , if both sides are willing - after the team uses its cap room . \"Pincus also mentioned that C Pau Gasol and C / PF Jordan Hill 's cap holds stand at $ 20.3 million and $ 6.7 million respectively for this off - season .The Lakers would definitely need to renounce Gasol 's bird rights and possibly Hill 's also to make a legitimate run at a max - contract player .Furthermore , Gasol would need to accept a steep discount , approximately $ 5.5 million to $ 8 million per season , to have any chance to rejoin the Lakers under any scenario .After retaining Bryant , Young , Sacre , Meeks , Johnson , Farmar , and a 1st round pick before the 10-day July moratorium period ends , the Lakers would then maintain up to approximately $ 26.63 million of cap space to sign free agents this off - season .Using the facts obtained from Larry Coon 's and Eric Pincus ' columns , let 's see the most plausible route the Lakers can take from here .Scenario # 1 : Sign Carmelo Anthony and choose between Pau Gasol or Jordan Hill .After hours of studying the salary cap and analyzing multiple reports , Carmelo Anthony seems to be the one and only max player the Lakers can reasonably sign next summer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.70763"}
