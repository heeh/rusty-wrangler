Roberts publicly warned his troops at Fort Jackson , S.C. , last spring that he and the Army had \" zero tolerance for sexual harassment and sexual assault .\" Here 's what the Army did n't tell the soldiers : At the time , Roberts himself was under investigation by the military over allegations that he physically assaulted one of his mistresses on multiple occasions . , as \" smoking hot \" and jokingly referring to explicit sexual acts .The married Uhrich later sought treatment for a drinking problem , but not before he was also investigated for allegedly having an affair , something prohibited under military law .The embarrassing episodes are described in previously undisclosed files of military investigations into personal misconduct by U.S. generals and admirals .Along with about two dozen other cases obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act , the investigations add to a litany of revelations about misbehaving brass that have dogged the Pentagon over the past 15 months and tarnished the reputation of U.S. military leadership .Since November 2012 , when an adulterous affair felled David H. Petraeus , the CIA director and most renowned Army general of his generation , the armed forces have struggled to cope with tawdry disclosures about high - ranking commanders .The subject is painfully sensitive inside the Pentagon , where many generals and admirals say they are appalled but reluctant to openly criticize their peers .\" It 's just offensive when you see people do some of the things we 've seen .It 's just completely offensive , \" said an Army brigadier general who spoke on the condition of anonymity . \"As officers , we ought to be held to a higher standard .Some of this stuff you 're seeing with folks is just completely unacceptable . \"Martin L. Cook , a professor of military ethics at the Naval War College in Newport , R.I. , said the recent eruption of misconduct is \" frankly a puzzle to everybody .\" One factor , he added , may be that as officers climb higher in the ranks they become insulated and fewer people are willing to challenge or question them .In his ethics classes , Cook said , military leaders recognize \" they 've got a major trust problem with the American people . . . .They 're deeply ashamed of it .It 's horror .They say , ' Oh , we ca n't have that happening . ' \" Since then , however , even more cases have come to light and consternation has continued to fester at the Pentagon .On Dec. 12 , Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel issued an unpublicized directive to Dempsey and the military chiefs , asking for another ethics review , this time of how the military teaches \" core values and ethical leadership \" to its officers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.46794"}
{"text": "A large majority concerned generals in the Army and Air Force .Some of the probes involve relatively minor infractions of military regulations or policy .But the most common transgressions are related to sexual or personal misbehavior .In seven of the cases , investigators determined that generals had affairs or engaged in \" inappropriate \" relationships .While the public may have become accustomed to stories of philandering politicians or ethical breaches by corporate leaders , such behavior is still considered intolerable inside the military , especially for generals and admirals who are expected to set a sterling example .The Uniform Code of Military Justice prohibits adultery or \" improper \" personal relationships , and officers can be prosecuted or disciplined for such offenses .Just as significantly , however , military leaders are under intense scrutiny from Congress and the White House for how they respond to sexual assault or abuse in the ranks .Reports of such cases have escalated in recent years .Some lawmakers have tried to strip commanders of their authority to oversee those investigations , arguing that they lack legal training and are too often insensitive to the problem .In the April 4 edition of The Fort Jackson Leader , a newspaper published for the South Carolina post where the Army conducts much of its basic training , Brig .Gen. Roberts let it be known where he stood on the issue . \" Team Jackson , let me be clear , the Army has zero tolerance for sexual harassment and sexual assault , and so do I , \" Roberts wrote .\" I view sexual harassment and assault as an enemy threat . . . .All of us have a shared role in ridding our ranks of this cancerous conduct .\" At the time , Roberts - the top commander at Fort Jackson - was under criminal investigation by the Army .Two months earlier , a woman filed a complaint alleging that she had been carrying on an affair with the married general for 18 months and that the relationship had turned violent on four occasions , according to an investigative report from the Army inspector general .Most recently , the woman told investigators , the pair got into an argument in the general 's quarters after she inadvertently called his wife on her cellphone .The woman said she slapped the general ; in turn , he \" bit her lip , \" and she suffered an eye injury .Although the woman said their sex was consensual , she added that she needed medical attention after two previous \" physical altercations \" with Roberts , according to the Army inspector general 's investigative report .As Army investigators began making inquiries , they found a second woman , a subordinate civilian employee , who told them she , too , was involved in a consensual sexual relationship with Roberts .Roberts 's phone records led investigators to a third woman , also a subordinate civilian employee .The records showed the two had called each other more than 900 times over six months , mostly at night or on weekends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.73317"}

Pete Sessions of Texas .Equally predictable was the outcome of the investigation .When Chris Homan , Rep. Sessions ' district representative , was informed that the charges made by Mrs. Howard had been confirmed by Donnamaria Carpino , there was stunned silence .It seems that Sessions ' staff had not even bothered to inform the Howards of the outcome of the investigation .Chris Homan stated that based on the IG report , \" General Hale was a hero for keeping Specialist Howard out of a Turkish prison and there did n't seem to be reason to send the Howards a copy of the report . \"Homan also pleaded they did n't have a forwarding address for the Howards , as if the U.S. Army does n't forward mail or could n't provide the current address of an active duty soldier to a congressional staffer in less than a hour .As for the issue of the racial persecution of U.S. troops in Turkey , Cohen is already on top of this issue .Last January , four airmen stationed at Incirlik Air Force Base , Turkey , were arrested and detained by the Turkish police .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.57392"}
