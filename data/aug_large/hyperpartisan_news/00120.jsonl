{"text": "Mrs. Currie was summoned to the White House on Sunday , January 18 , 1998 for a private meeting with President Clinton .The President was under court order not to talk about the case to anyone .Nonetheless , after telling Mrs. Currie that he had been deposed in the Paula Jones case and that Ms. Jones ' attorneys had asked the President several questions about Ms. Lewinsky , President Clinton then made a series of statements to Mrs. Currie : .I was never really alone with Monica , right ?You were always there when Monica was there , right ?Monica came on to me , and I never touched her , right ?You could see and hear everything , right ?The testimony of Mrs. Currie and President Clinton demonstrate that these statements were an attempt to influence the future testimony of Mrs. Currie regarding the President 's relationship with Monica Lewinsky .President Clinton admitted being alone with Ms. Lewinsky .Mrs. Currie also testified that the President and Ms. Lewinsky had been alone .President Clinton was attempting to improperly persuade Mrs. Currie to testify that he and Ms. Lewinsky were never alone .Mrs. Currie testified that President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky were alone a number of times .Despite the legal hairsplitting engaged in by the White House , I interpret the statement ' You were always there when Monica was there , right ? ' to mean that President Clinton was attempting to improperly persuade Mrs. Currie to testify that Ms. Lewinsky was always within Mrs. Currie 's sight during her visits to the President .Based upon Ms. Lewinsky 's testimony , President Clinton 's statement that ' Monica came on to me , and I never touched her , right ? 'would clearly be false .In addition , because even President Clinton admitted to ' inappropriate intimate contact , ' I assume that President Clinton is at least admitting to having touched Ms. Lewinsky .As a result , I must conclude that President Clinton did touch Ms. Lewinsky .In his grand jury testimony , President Clinton admitted that he did not allow Mrs. Currie to ' watch whatever intimate activity [ the President ] did with Ms. Lewinsky . 'In addition , when asked whether he would ' not have engaged in those physically intimate acts if [ the President ] knew that Mrs. Currie could see or hear that , ' President Clinton responded ' [ t]hat 's correct . 'However , on the Sunday after he was deposed in the Paula Jones ' case , Mr. Clinton told Mrs. Currie ' You could see and hear everything , right ? 'I find these two concepts to be inherently contradictory .President Clinton could not , on the one hand , shield Mrs. Currie from seeing or hearing any intimate activity , while , on the other hand , be sincerely stating that Mrs. Currie could see and hear everything .I must then conclude that President Clinton made this statement in an attempt to improperly persuade Ms. Currie to testify that President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky engaged in no activity that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.77397"}
{"text": "President Clinton responded : ' That is not my recollection .My recollection is that I did not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky and I 'm staying on my former statement about that . 'If Ms. Lewinsky 's testimony is true , President Clinton committed perjury during his grand jury testimony .I have had the opportunity to read the portions of grand jury testimony provided by both President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky concerning their characterizations of their sexual relations .I also had the opportunity to watch Ms. Lewinsky 's videotaped deposition in which she reaffirmed her previous grand jury testimony concerning the extent of their sexual relations .B. Testimony concerning his account of the relationship to Betty Currie : .On January 18 , 1998 , President Clinton met with Mrs. Currie at the White House and told her ' there are several things you may want to know ' about the President 's relationship with Monica Lewinsky .During his grand jury testimony , President Clinton stated that ' I was not trying to get Betty Currie to say something that was untruthful . 'However , as discussed further in the obstruction of justice charges , President Clinton said to Mrs. Currie ' Monica came on to me , and I never touched her , right ? 'Based upon both Ms. Lewinsky and President Clinton 's testimony concerning their intimate contact , and upon Ms. Lewinsky 's Senate deposition , I must conclude that Ms. Lewinsky 's account of their intimate activity is accurate .As will be discussed further below , I conclude that President Clinton made a series of statements to Betty Currie in an attempt to improperly persuade her to provide false testimony .The President 's statements before the grand jury concerning his interest in talking to Mrs. Currie would thus constitute perjury .C. Testimony concerning his account of the relationship to Sidney Blumenthal and John Podesta : .In his grand jury testimony , President Clinton asserted in his conversations with Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Podesta , that ' I said things that were true .They may have been misleading . 'President Clinton further states that ' what I was trying to do was give them something they could -- that would be true , even if misleading in the context of this deposition . 'Mr. Clinton told Sidney Blumenthal that ' Monica Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual demand on me ' and that the President had rebuffed her .When Mr. Blumenthal asked the President whether Mr. Clinton had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky , the President replied ' I was within eyesight or earshot of someone . 'Even President Clinton acknowledges that he was alone with Monica Lewinsky , and , therefore not within eyesight or earshot of anybody , on numerous occasions .Mr. Clinton also acknowledges that he and Ms. Lewinsky engaged in ' inappropriate intimate contact ' which , if Ms. Lewinsky 's testimony is true , amounted to sexual relations as President Clinton understood the term to be defined in the Paula Jones case .As a result , the President lied , not simply misled Mr. Blumenthal , when Mr. Clinton stated that he had ' rebuffed her .
