{"text": "Never confuse the actions of a black individual ( or a group of black individuals ) that mistreats someone white as proof that black racism exists .Their \" power \" is limited ONLY to what they can do as individuals .There are NO black institutions or systems that support , defend , or finance the right of blacks to mistreat whites .There are NO black institutions that are more powerful than white institutions .Therefore , blacks do not have the COLLECTIVE POWER to diminish the quality of life for the white collective .Q : What is collective power ?A : Collective power is the institutions and systems that benefit one group at the expense of another group , and allow one group to dominate another group in all areas of human activity .That is white collective power .It is rare for a white police officer to be punished for using excessive force against a black man , woman , or child .It is just as rare for a black police officer to use excessive force against a white person .In fact , the authors were unable to find a single instance of a black police officer shooting or killing an unarmed white person in the history of modern law enforcement .This is not surprising but it is absolute proof that the black individual operating within a system of white supremacy can not mistreat whites even if he or she is wearing a uniform , a badge , and carrying a gun .Another example of white collective power is the mortgage and real estate industry , which systematically discriminates against black ( and non - white ) renters , homebuyers , and homeowners by : .( gentrification ) .Banks , real estate brokers , appraisers , and mortgage lenders represent INSTITUTIONAL RACISM ( power ) that is reinforced by the courts , banking , and government ( systems ) .This does not mean blacks are less likely to abuse power than whites if given the opportunity .It means blacks can not abuse power that does not exist .The proof : there is no place in America where blacks are collectively practicing racism against whites collectively .Q : Do n't black politicians and corporate executives represent black power ?A : Not necessarily .Having a powerful position does not make a person powerful .For example , shortly after a female employee sued the XYZ firm for sex discrimination , Ms. X and Mrs. Y are appointed to the corporate board .They will be used as proof in the upcoming trial that the XYZ firm does not discriminate against women .Like most token board members , Ms. X and Mrs. Y are benchwarmers ; not policy makers .Their \" powerful \" positions are an ILLUSION designed to deceive the public and the courts .The black man or woman in a ( public ) position of power often serves the same purpose : to give the appearance that certain companies do not discriminate .These blacks maybe qualified for their position ; however , even the \" powerful \" black person - regardless of title -- is still controlled by more powerful whites who limit whatever authority or power this black individual possesses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.905983"}

{"text": "There are many ways to expose the mercurial nature of racial classification .Such episodes serve to unmask the instability of racial systems , yet simply marshaling evidence to prove taxonomies fickle tells only a partial story .In an effort to tell a fuller story about the workings of \" race\"-by which I mean principally the endeavors of racial categorization and stratification - I focus here on historical actors who crossed geographical boundaries and lived their lives within different racial systems .A vision that accounts for the experiences of sojourners and migrants illuminates the ways in which racial classification shifts across borders and thus deepens arguments about racial construction and malleability .At the same time , however , the principal argument of this essay moves in a different direction .We tend to think of the fluid and the mutable as less powerful than the rigid and the immutable , thereby equating the exposure of unstable racial categories with an assault on the very construct of race itself .In a pioneering essay in which Barbara J. Fields took a historical analysis of the concept of race as her starting point , she contended that ideologies of race are continually created and verified in daily life .Hilary McD. Beckles affirms that \" the analysis of ' real experience ' and the theorising of ' constructed representation ' constitute part of the same intellectual project .\" Drawing together these theoretical strands , I argue that the scrutiny of day - to - day lives demonstrates not only the mutability of race but also , and with equal force , the abiding power of race in local settings .Neither malleability nor instability , then , necessarily diminishes the potency of race to circumscribe people 's daily lives ... .Thomas E.

{"text": "We are always in error whenever we attempt to repair or fix the inequities in education by simplifying the problems to one particular subgroup of our society .Education needs much more than simply more black male teachers .Having said that , I must also say that having a black male teacher has not always been in the best interest of my children .In fact , last year , my black male son who is in high school had a terrible experience with a black male teacher at a school that is nationally ranked in Louisville , KY .The teacher did not care if he learned , did not try to reach him , and made every effort to make a villain out of my son .In addition to that , the assistant principal and secretaries at the school worked to cover up for the actions of the teacher .While it was a less than desirable situation , it served as a learning experience for my son .I do feel that more African American male teachers would benefit male students however , any teacher can have an impact .The key , regardless of race , sex , color or creed is that teachers have to be willing to build relationships with their students .I am a white female who taught 8th grade for 8 years before leaving the classroom to head up a Positive Behavior Intervnetion Support ( PBIS ) intitiative in my district .Over and over again , I witness teachers who only see their role as getting kids ready to take the \" big \" test .In my opinion , this pressure has created tunnel vision and they do n't correlate that greater academic success will occur if students feel supported and safe .Today 's teachers have to realize that their roles as educators in today 's society has changed .We have to be a nurturer first and a teacher second .The need for more teachers of every ethnicity , gender and background are required for the full and diversified education of our children is great and should be addressed by any means possible .The African American male teachers need to be focused in the academic classroom , not in athletics or music .Solid role models , look to Colan Powell as an example , are needed and may come from the general community .Teachers of any gender and ethnicity should incorporate such role models into daily lessons , if the African American men can not be found .On a larger scale , diversity is a necessary part of the American community and the world community .Focus on individual accomplishments and needs is the way for all peoples to live together profitably .Please check out the \" Call Me Mister \" program at Claflin University .The program , in conjunction with CLemson Universityk , is designed to prepare black males to teach in public schools .So oiften black males come from single parent homes where they are raised by a mother or a grandmother , an aunt or sister .They go to school and the only black male presence may be the custodian and on occasion , a principal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.051575"}
{"text": "Alrighty then .Since my disagreements with O'Reilly a few years ago , I 've refused to appear on the Fox News network .I did two appearances on Fox Business , but only because I have modest respect for John Stossel and wanted to discuss the exploitation of college athletes .Beyond that , I 've turned down every appearance request I 've received since that time .I also cringe whenever I see Black commentators being forced to cater to one of the most racist media outlets in American history , only because they have money and an audience .I personally believe that we give credibility to the beast by feeding it with our attention .The truth is that we risk looking weak and desperate when we allow bigoted Whites to put us in situations that they themselves would never accept .Allowing racists to put us on the defensive is one symptom of our continued second - class citizenship .With that said , Bill O'Reilly exists in America for a reason , the same way certain bacteria can only survive in a moldy refrigerator .He thrives in American media because O'Reilly is a living manifestation of every angry , uneducated racist in our country .He connects to the misguided White man the way Beyonce relates to 31-year old Black women .There are a lot of angry , ignorant , arrogant Americans in this country , and those are the people who tune into Fox News .O'Reilly is not only an enemy of progress who seeks to destroy the country he claims to love , he also fails to understand that it is White men like himself who create the things that he and other White men seem to fear .O'Reilly cheered the death of Trayvon Martin because for him , most urban Black males are dastardly , frightening beasts , unworthy of the decency that one would give a fellow human being .Few intelligent people would disagree with the statistics that O'Reilly spews about the struggles of the Black community : Violence is out of control , too many of our families are broken down , we are filling up the penitentiaries , and our economic hurdles are monumental .But where O'Reilly gets off the bus is when the words \" personal responsibility \" come into the mix .You see , White men like O'Reilly are the ones who push to supply guns onto the Black market that young Black teenagers use to kill each other .If they were giving these guns to White kids with no jobs or education , they 'd be killing each other too .It 's hard to hold families together when you 're giving fathers and mothers 100 year prison sentences for crimes that White college students commit every single day of the week .White men like O'Reilly are the ones who profited from the 400-year legacy of slavery and Jim Crow , which created the vast economic disparities built from Whites systematically stealing nearly every penny of wealth from Black families over the course of several hundred years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.063797"}

'Reward or punish the individual on his merits as an individual .Evil will surely come in the end to both races if we substitute for this just rule the habit of treating all the members of the race , good and bad , alike .The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bands of civilization ; that the spirit of lynching inevitably throws into prominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell therein .No man can take part in the torture of a human being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered .Every lynching means just so much moral deterioration in all the children who have any knowledge of it , and therefore just so much additional trouble for the next generation of Americans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.95547"}

Hasan Johnson , Ph.D. .There 's been much ado lately about the missing 276 young women in Nigeria , and rightly so .The issues and challenges of girls and women are difficult in many contexts , but most especially in regions where imperialism and religious fundamentalism cross swords .In Nigeria , the rise of Boko Haram since 2009 ( whose name means \" Western education is forbidden \" in the local Hausa language ) as a terrorizing Islamic - Nationalist force has been devastating to say the least .Their self - initiated war against Western education has gone to great extremes and has resulted in their attacking Christians , women , and most especially girls .But I should add that they 've also attacked other Muslims and boys .Why separate out these two categories ?Because our media laden culture has desensitized us to the nuanced and fractured nature of human social groups .Despite former President Bush 's incredulous use of the term ' terrorists , ' most Muslims are not terrorists and condemn violence , and are therefore as much victimized as anyone else ...However , we tend to put all Muslims in the same boat .In similar fashion , we often overlook boys and men when it comes to gendered atrocities , as their deaths become assumed and invisible , and they are strictly labelled as aggressors , a lazy analysis to say the least .Whether it 's a civil unrest or an outright war , male death is expected .In relation to the recent issues in Nigeria , it 's becoming fashionable to condemn Boko Haram and cry out \" bring back our girls ! \" much the way people jumped on the bandwagon to attack Donald Sterling .But again , as Bomani Jones brilliantly points out about Sterling , this ai n't new .Not with Sterling , nor with Boko Haram .In fact , Boko Haram is said to have killed as many as 3,000 people since 2009 , but the international outrage has been strangely missing .It 's been recently reported that , \" In an hour - long video obtained by Agence France - Presse , a man identifying himself as Boko Haram 's leader , Abubakar Shekau , claimed responsibility for the abductions and threatened to make the girls slaves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.73439"}

{"text": "My original question to Ally in the other thread was how many of the total figure for male assaults were asynchronous and unprovoked and how many were n't .My original point being that unless we can separate those out , we are potentially merging victim and perpetrator and \" line of duty \" figures and drawing misleading conclusions about relative risk .I do n't think that is disingenuous , I think that is seeking clarity in the data so that a true comparison can be made .Although I accept Ally 's point that it is not always easy to tease out those differences as violence is rarely asynchronous for either men or women ( allegedly ) .Though I think even if that is the case then there are other points to be made about men and women 's relative ability to inflict injury and their relative exposure to risk .\" So it 's not victim blaming if the victim was breaking the law by , say , smoking weed or drinking underage ?Since when has the definition of victim blaming excluded situations where the victim was breaking the law ? \" Are you talking about sexual violence here ?Blame is only appropriate if the victim has contributed to the crime .In the case of sexual violence , how is this possible ?What are the circumstances whereby a person can contribute to somebody having sex with them when they do n't want them to ?It seems to me to be a paradox to invite coercion .Whereas it is not a logical fallacy that you can provoke or invite violence . 1 ) If a person has sex with another person non - consensually , then the crime committed is the unconsensual sex .The victim has not contributed to the crime and therefore blame is inappropriate . 2 ) If two gangs get into a violent confrontation and one assaults the other ( or more successfully assaults the other ) then the crime committed is assault .It still does n't negate the crime , there is still a victim , but the victim contributed to the crime and some blame is appropriate , in that particular case .That 's not to say that he could n't be a blameless victim in a different scenario .What I was trying to convey was the difference between likelihood , risk and susceptibility .Yes men may be twice as likely to be murdered as women , but that does n't mean , ( as I feel was implied ) that they are twice as susceptible to murder or twice at risk of it .For instance , if that figure includes murders sustained in the line of duty , and more men than women are in front line positions , then the higher figure is attached to the activity not the individual or their gender as such .Swimmers are 100 % likely to get wet , runners maybe 20 % , it does n't mean swimmers are more susceptible to water .Again this is an attempt to get some clarity around the data .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.9372"}

{"text": "In 2008 , the Commission held a briefing regarding the impact of illegal immigration on the wages and employment opportunities of African - Americans . 1 The testimony at the briefing indicated that illegal immigration disproportionately impacts the wages and employment opportunities of African - American men .The briefing witnesses , well - regarded scholars from leading universities and independent groups , were ideologically diverse .All the witnesses acknowledged that illegal immigration has a negative impact on black employment , both in terms of employment opportunities and wages .The witnesses differed on the extent of that impact , but every witness agreed that illegal immigration has a discernible negative effect on black employment .For example , Professor Gordon Hanson 's research showed that \" Immigration . . .accounts for about 40 percent of the 18 percentage point decline [ from 1960 - 2000 ] in black employment rates . \" 4 Professor Gerald Jaynes 's research found that illegal immigrants had displaced U.S. citizens in industries that had traditionally employed large numbers of African - Americans , such as meatpacking .Illegal immigration has a disparate impact on African - American men because these men are disproportionately represented in the low - skilled labor force .The Census Bureau released a new report on educational attainment after the Commission issued its report .This report , released in February 2012 , found that 50.9 percent of native - born blacks had not continued their education beyond high school .6 The same report found that 75.5 percent of foreign - born Hispanics had not been educated beyond high school , although it does not disaggregate foreign - born Hispanics who are legal immigrants from those who are illegal immigrants . 7However , Professor Briggs estimated that illegal immigrants or former illegal immigrants who received amnesty constitute a third to over a half of the total foreign - born population . 8 Foreign - born Hispanics who are in the United States illegally are disproportionately male .9 African - Americans who have not pursued education beyond high school are also disproportionately male .10 These poor educational attainment levels usually relegate both African - American men and illegal immigrant men to the same low - skilled labor market , where they must compete against each other for work .The obvious question is whether there are sufficient jobs in the low - skilled labor market for both African - Americans and illegal immigrants .The answer is no .As Professor Briggs noted in his testimony to the Commission , \" In February 2008 . . .the national unemployment rate was 4.8 percent , but the unemployment rate for adults ( over 25 years old ) without a high school diploma was 7.3 percent . \"12 During 2007 , \" Black American adult workers without a high school diploma had an unemployment rate of 12.0 percent , and those with only a high school diploma had an unemployment rate of 7.3 percent . \"13 These statistics suggest both that there is an overall surplus of workers in the low - skilled labor market , and that African - Americans are particularly disfavored by employers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.404816"}

{"text": "The same type of education / age comparison used to measure the wage impact shows that a 10 percent increase in the size of a skill group reduced the fraction of native - born blacks in that group holding a job by 5.1 percentage points .Furthermore , these statistics reflect an economy that was not experiencing the persistent stagnation we are experiencing today .The country 's economic woes have disproportionately harmed African - Americans , especially those with little education .In 2011 , 24.6 percent of African - Americans without a high school diploma were unemployed , as were 15.5 percent of African - Americans with only a high school diploma .16 Two and half years into the economic recovery , African - Americans face particular difficulty obtaining employment .According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the seasonally adjusted January 2013 unemployment rate for all black Americans - not just those with few skills - was 13.8 percent , nearly twice the white unemployment rate of 7.0 percent .17 The economy has a glut of low - skilled workers , not a shortage .Not only do illegal immigrants compete for jobs with African - Americans , but that competition drives down wages for the jobs that are available .Harvard professor George Borjas writes : . 'Illegal immigration reduces the wages of native workers by an estimated $ 99 to $ 118 billion a year . . . .A theory - based framework predicts that the immigrants who entered the country from 1990 to 2010 reduced the average annual earnings of American workers by $ 1,396 in the short run .Because immigration ( legal and illegal ) increased the supply of workers unevenly , the impact varies across skill groups , with high school dropouts being the most negatively affected group .Immigration , both legal and illegal , resulted in a disproportionately large increase in the number of high school dropouts in the labor pool .This caused a drop in wages among the poorest and least - educated members of the workforce .19 As discussed above , these people are disproportionately likely to be African - American men .Furthermore , there is evidence that wages for these men have not just failed to increase as much as they would have in the absence of illegal immigration .Their real wages , the number of dollars they take home at the end of the week , have actually diminished .20 A $ 960 annual decrease may not seem like much to a lawyer or a doctor .The consequences of illegal immigration for black men and the black community in general are not limited to wages .In another study , Borjas found that lower wages and fewer jobs also correlate with an increase in the black incarceration rate .Among white men , the same 10 % increase in supply reduces the wage by 3.2 % , but has much weaker employment and incarceration effects : a 2.1 percentage - point reduction in the employment rate and a 0.2 percentage - point increase in the incarceration rate .It seems , therefore , that black employment and incarceration rates are more sensitive to immigration rates than those of whites .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.33372"}

{"text": "Transcending Blackness , Reinforcing White Racism : The Trouble With Exceptions .If whites view Obama as having transcended his blackness , and if this is why we like him so much , we are saying , in effect , that the millions of blacks who have n't transcended theirs will remain a problem .To praise the transcending of blackness , after all , is to imply that blackness is something negative , something from which one who might otherwise qualify for membership ought to seek escape , and quickly .Note , never has a white politician been confronted with questions about his or her ability to transcend race , or specifically , their whiteness .And this is true , even as many white politicians continue to pull almost all of their support from whites , and have almost no luck at convincing people of color to vote for them .In the Democratic primaries this year , Obama has regularly received about half the white vote , while Hillary Clinton has managed to pull down only about one - quarter of the black vote , yet the question has always been whether he could transcend race .The only rational conclusion to which this points is , again , that it is not race per se that needs to be overcome , but blackness .Whiteness is not seen as negative , as something to be conquered or transcended .In what must prove among the greatest ironies of all time , for Barack Obama to become President , which he well may accomplish , he will have to succeed in convincing a lot of racist white people to vote for him .Without the support of racists he simply ca n't win .While this may seem counterintuitive -- that is , after all , what makes it ironic -- it is really inarguable .Without the votes of at least some of those whites ( and keep in mind , that 's how many whites are willing to admit to racist beliefs , which is likely far fewer than actually hold them ) , Obama 's candidacy would be sunk .So long as whites can vote for a black man only to the extent that he does n't remind them of other black people , it is fair to say that white people remain mired in a racism quite profound .But make no mistake , it is an ecumenism that depends upon our being made to feel good , and on our ability to glom onto folks of color who wo n't challenge our denial let alone our privileges , even if they might like to .In short , the success of Barack Obama has proven , perhaps more so than any other single thing could , just how powerful race remains in America .His success , far from disproving white power and privilege , confirms it with a vengeance .2 comments : .I just ordered Tim 's book today .I fear that Obamamania is having an adverse effect on my political thinking , so I 'm reading as many conscious perspectives on Obama as I can .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.42633"}

Jamison felt that the indictment of four white men indicated a \" better chance at Justice than any involving the races in the South , \" but , he added , \" still no white men have ever been executed .\" Elijah Muhammad , leader of the Nation of Islam , expressed this viewpoint forcefully .Using almost the exact same language as white supremacists , he accused the \" four devil rapists \" of destroying the \" virginity of our daughters . \" \" Appeals for justice , \" he fumed , \" will avail us nothing .We know there is no justice under the American flag .\" 39 Nearly all the editorials in major black newspapers echoed his sentiments .Ella Baker , director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , felt that the evidence in the Tallahassee case was so strong that \" not even an all white Florida jury could fail to convict .\" Reminding whites of their tendency to mete out unequal justice toward black men , she warned , \" with memories of Negroes who have been lynched and executed on far less evidence , Negro leaders from all over the South will certainly examine every development in this case . ...What will Florida 's answer be ? \"The New York Amsterdam News called for equal justice , noting that the \" law which calls for the death sentence does not say that Negro rapists should be punished by death and white rapists should be allowed to live . \" The Pittsburgh Courier bet on acquittal , despite the fact that the case \" is as open and shut as a case can be . \"Martin Luther King Jr. , at the annual SCLC meeting in Tallahassee a few days after the indictment , praised the student protesters for giving \" hope to all of us who struggle for human dignity and equal justice .\"But he tempered his optimism with political savvy , calling on the federal government to force the country to practice what it preached in its Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union .\"Violence in the South can not be deplored or ignored , \" King declared , directing his criticism at President Dwight D. Eisenhower ; \" without effective action , the situation will worsen .\" 41 King exploited a political context in which America 's racial problems were increasingly an international issue .The British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) broadcast segments of the Florida A&M University student speeches condemning the rape and racial injustice , while newspapers throughout Europe closely watched the case unfold .This international angle was a strategy shared by mainstream integrationists , leftist radicals , and black nationalists alike .Audley \" Queen Mother \" Moore , leader of the Universal Association of Ethiopian Women , Inc. , petitioned the United Nations Human Rights Commission in person to end the \" planned lynch terror and willful destruction of our people . \" She tied issues of race , gender , sex , and citizenship together by demanding Justice Department assistance for Betty Jean Owens 's rape case , an FBI investigation of the Mack Charles Parker lynching , and basic voting rights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.68196"}

{"text": "Being selective about Malcolm 's life and only focusing on his \" post - Hajj \" years is to overlook Malcolm 's complexities and how his life journey carries such a meaningful message about self - criticism , among other things .He was committed to learning and , unlike the political \" leaders \" in the world today , was not afraid to admit his mistakes .There are still things we need to be critical of , however .Similar to how bell hooks critiqued Frantz Fanon , Paulo Freire , and Aime Cesaire on their male - centered language , the same needs to be said about Malcolm X. Writing only about male experiences with oppression perpetuates sexism , as it ignores and erases the experiences of women .As Michael Eric Dyson writes , \" Such a strategy not only borrows ideological capital from the white patriarchy that has historically demeaned black America , but blunts awareness of how the practice of patriarchy of black men has created another class of victims within black communities .\" I remember when I took an entire class on Malcolm X , the professor , an African - American woman , critiqued Malcolm 's sexist logic throughout the semester and reminded us that much of Malcolm 's legacy has been shaped and defined by men .Malcolm was a strong advocate of women 's education , but many of his attitudes towards women were also restrictive and rooted in distrust .My professor also spoke a lot about the women who played a significant role in Malcolm 's life , including his wife Betty Shabazz and his mother and sisters who taught him \" the importance of race pride and self identity .\" I do find Malcolm 's sexist logic to be in line with traditional patriarchal attitudes that we can find in all communities .In his autobiography , Malcolm explains that Islam teaches true Love because the beauty of the person is found within , not on the outside .I believe this is true , but the stereotypical gender roles were also present in Malcolm 's interpretation .As a young Muslim man , I saw Malcolm 's leadership , politics , and courage as an example that was exclusive to men .I viewed Prophet Muhammad , peace be upon him , in a similar way .That is , men alone needed to be leaders and role models , whereas women were \" followers \" and \" looked up to us . \"Critiques about masculinity and sexism in Malcolm 's life are important ; they have been and are addressed by black feminists and activists .In other narratives , a lot of non - black Muslims try to isolate Malcolm as a Muslim and only a Muslim while ignoring African - American struggle .Through this process , Malcolm 's racial identity gets erased and he becomes an appropriated icon - this appropriation , under the assumption that all marginalized communities \" share \" the \" same \" oppression , only contributes to anti - black racism .Although I am not African - American , Malcolm 's speeches about not being ashamed of your skin color or where you come from resonated with me very strongly at a young age .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.81913"}

{"text": "During the Jim Crow era , women 's bodies served as signposts of the social order , and white men used rape and rumors of rape not only to justify violence against black men but to remind black women that their bodies were not their own .African American women frequently retaliated by testifying about their brutal experiences .I argue that , from Harriet Jacobs to Ida B. Wells to the women of the present , the refusal of black women to remain silent about sexualized violence was part of a long - standing tradition .Black women described and denounced their sexual misuse , deploying their voices as weapons in the wars against white supremacy .Indeed , their public protests often galvanized local , national , and even international outrage and sparked campaigns for racial justice and human dignity .When Betty Jean Owens spoke out against her assailants , and when the local black community mobilized in defense of her womanhood in 1959 , they joined in this tradition of testimony and protest .The arrest , trial , and conviction of Owens 's white rapists by an all - white jury marked a dramatic change in the relations between this tradition of testimony and a tradition of silence that Darlene Clark Hine has termed the \" culture of dissem - blance . \" 4 The verdict not only broke with southern tradition but fractured the philosophical and political foundations of white supremacy by challenging the relationship between sexual domination and racial inequality .For perhaps the first time since Reconstruction , southern black communities could imagine state power being deployed in defense of their respectability as men and women .As a result , the 1959 Tallahassee rape case was a watershed event that remains as revealing now as it was important then .The sexual exploitation of black women had its roots in slavery .Slave owners , overseers , and drivers took advantage of their positions of power and authority to rape slave women , sometimes in the presence of their husbands or families .White slave owners ' stolen access to black women 's bodies strengthened their political , social , and economic power , partly because colonial laws made the offspring of slave women the property of their masters .5 After the fall of slavery , when African Americans asserted their freedom during the interracial experiment in democracy that briefly characterized Reconstruction , former slaveholders and their sympathizers used violence and terror to reassert control over the social , political , and economic agency of freedpeople .At the heart of this violence , according to Gerda Lerner , rape became a \" weapon of terror \" to dominate the bodies and minds of African American men and women .\" Freedom , \" as Tera Hunter notes , \" was meaningless without ownership and control over one 's own body . \"During Reconstruction and Jim Crow , sexualized violence served as a \" ritualistic reenactment of the daily pattern of social dominance , \" and interracial rape became the battleground upon which black men and women fought for ownership of their own bodies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.96028"}

Blow wrote an op - ed for the New York Times .As the 911 tapes were released and began to raise troubling questions about the shooter 's pursuit of Trayvon and the Sanford Police investigation .These tapes prompted Judd Legume of Think Progress on March 18 to put together a set of simple facts titled \" What Everyone Should Know About Trayvon Martin ( 1995 - 2012 ) \" ; that story quickly went viral , with 147,000 likes on Facebook .The petition topped 200,000 signatures , and it seemed that everyone on social media was talking about the Trayvon Martin case .There 's more to this story of Trayvon , racism and social media , however .There is also an amped up , racist smear campaign that is trying to promote the idea that Trayvon was a \" drug dealer \" who is far more dangerous than the mainstream and left - leaning blogosphere has depicted .While it might be easy to dismiss the people behind sites like WAGIST as right - wing nut jobs ( RWNJ ) , that 's too easy .Dismissing them as fringe also does n't accurately describe what 's happening around Trayvon , racism and social media .The thoroughly mainstream , if right - leaning , Business Insider has made a linkbait - cottage - industry out of news about the Trayvon Martin case , including a photo it reported was of Trayvon in a \" thug \" pose and used it to question the supposed bias in media reporting .Unfortunately , the photo was not of the Trayvon Martin who was killed but of someone else .The source for the Business Insider photo : white power message board Stormfront .And Business Insider was n't the only one .Michelle Malkin , right - wing pundit , also reproduced the photo on her site .The fact that Business Insider and Michelle Malkin are reproducing images from Stormfront illustrates the point I made earlier about the overlap between extremist and more mainstream expressions of white supremacy .The racist smear campaign against Trayvon Martin continues .Today , it 's reported that a white supremacist hacker that goes by the name \" Klanklannon \" has broken into the private Facebook account of Trayvon Martin and published the contents on the message board 4chan - called \" /pol/. \" The messages were posted on four slides , designed to back up the racist argument Trayvon was \" dangerous \" ( and therefore deserved to be killed ) .A slide titled \" Trayvon Martin Used Marijuana Habitually , \" features an exchange between Trayvon and a friend about getting high .Another slide , \" Trayvon Martin was a Drug Dealer , \" features Facebook messages and photos that supposedly prove Martin dealt drugs , including a picture of Martin posing \" aggressively with a large amount of cash in his hand .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.72525"}

Ray , Associate Professor of African and Afro- American Studies Brandeis University , Waltham , Massachusetts .In the summer and fall of 1919 , the African - owned Gold Coast press was awash with news stories and impassioned commentary about the postwar race riots that had recently devastated Liverpool , Cardiff , and other major port cities in Britain .Angered by the sexual politics underlying the riots , Gold Coast commentators were quick to point out that the ports ' white rioters were not the only ones aggrieved by interracial sexual relations .In a few short lines , Atu vivified the \" tensions of empire \" created by the movement of African men between metropole and colony , and their different systems of raced and gendered sexual access .Not long after , the Leader published a series of commentaries under the provocative title \" Immoral Sanitation .\" The unnamed author of the series ' first installment declared that unseemly sexual liaisons between African women and European men had transformed the \" social life \" of Sekondi , a busy coastal town in the Gold Coast 's Western Province , into \" a condition of depravity . \" Elsewhere in the colony , \" a woman who boldly acknowledges herself the kept mistress of a European is thrown out of society and virtually looked down upon by men and women of respectability , \" claimed the writer .In Sekondi , however , he accused \" energetic advocates of this dishonourable mode of life \" of enticing young women into sexual relationships with European men , whose \" carnal lust \" was causing the moral deterioration of the town 's womenfolk .The Leader 's lurid tales of illicit relationships between profligate white men and debauched African women during the early twentieth century contrast sharply with historical accounts of respectable marriages between entrepreneurial African women and European men during an earlier time period in coastal West Africa .These unions produced West Africa 's prominent Afro - European trading families and are often credited with successfully integrating European men into local West African societies and empowering African women during the long period of contact preceding the nineteenth - century advent of formal colonial rule .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.73468"}

{"text": "How the panic over rape was orchestrated TAGS : VIOLENCE , HOME OFFICE , CRIME For years the Home Office and the former Lord Chancellor 's Department have misled the media about rape statistics - and allowed the media to misinform the public .Anxiety has grown as a result of the apparent increase in rape offences and the inability to successfully prosecute offenders .Women have been needlessly alarmed for their safety , when the actual threat is much smaller than has been pretended .Congratulations , therefore , to the Radio 4 programme More or Less and its reporter Ruth Alexander , who have put into the public domain what some advisers engaged by Whitehall committees have known for some time .This official misinformation , one suspects , was a deliberate policy choice ( beginning somewhere around 1988 ) to ensure that no matter what the cost , rape and sex crimes would climb remorselessly up the political agenda .Since 1999 the Home Office has known that its methods for calculating rape convictions are wrong .The real conviction rate is not the publicly broadcast 10 per cent but closer to 50 per cent ( it varies slightly from year to year ) .The attrition rate refers to the number of convictions secured compared with the number of that particular crime reported to the police ( it must be noted that a crime that is ' reported ' does not automatically imply that the crime actually took place ) .The conviction rate refers to the number of convictions secured against the number of persons brought to trial for that given offence .Rape is the only crime judged by the attrition rate .All others - murder , assault , robbery , and so on - are assessed by their conviction rates .Why ?The question is best addressed to Betty Moxon who , in 2000 , was head of the Sex Offenders Review Team ( SORT ) for whom I wrote the minority report .In the most recent edition of More or Less , broadcast last Friday and still available as a podcast , Ruth Alexander questioned why rape has been made an exception .Referring to a new report soon to be published by London Metropolitan University she said it claimed that Britain had the worst record in Europe for rape convictions .Over recent years , she said , the report showed that the conviction rate had fallen from 10 per cent to 6.5 per cent .However DarkSideCat 's explications are not complete , as they are missing to mention legal fees .Legal fees play a highly important part of the US - legal system .It is the most expensive legal system in this world .Women claiming to be raped ( whatever ' rape ' might mean in USA ) will get assistance free of charge , while accused men find their accounts being locked , might find themselves in jail and have seriously problems to defend themselves .If you look through cases of the Innocent Project , you will find men convicted of rape , for a crime they did not commit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.80501"}
