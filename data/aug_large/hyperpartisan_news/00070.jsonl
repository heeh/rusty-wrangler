Sproul , had been a reactionary bureaucrat , not a liberal bureaucrat .( Kerr in those days played a role much appreciated by the faculty , not as a militant non - signer but as a mediator , and this strongly influenced his accession as chancellor in 1952 . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.52959"}

{"text": "The modifier \" National \" was applied to \" Socialist \" in order to distinguish Hitler 's brand of Socialism from Communism , which was \" international Socialism \" , as represented by the Comintern and directed by Stalin .The Nazis were very much Socialists , but wanted nothing to do with the vile cosmopolitan Bolshevik version of Socialism , which Hitler considered an alien Jewish ideology , unfit for his vision of the Aryan future .Nazism was destroyed by the Allies in 1945 , and Communism crumbled of its own weight in 1991 .But International Socialism did not die .By the 1970s it had spread throughout the institutions of the Free World like a metastasized cancer in the body politic of Western Civilization .Defiant Lion and EraserFS discussed the persistence of international Socialism in the comments section of one of the reports about last week 's debacle in Cologne , and then later on SIOE had this to say : .These Autonomers call themselves International Socialists , rather than National Socialists , as if nationalism is a bad thing .The operative word in National Socialism is not \" national \" , it is \" socialism \" .Socialism is always expansionist , and these Autonomers and their ilk are the new expansionist totalitarians , the real Nazis who support Islam ; they are Nazislamists .In their discussion , our commenters coined the neologism \" InterNazi \" for the modern incarnation of the International Socialist .I think the term will do nicely .In 21st - century Europe , InterNazis can be found most frequently in the various chapters of Antifa , also known as Anti - fascist Action ( with variants in several languages ) or AFA .The affinity of Antifa for the Nazi ideology and iconography can be observed in the logos below .The stylized \" A \" in the middle symbol is a common logo for the Anarchists , of which the Antifas form a particularly virulent branch .The right - hand symbol with its lightning - bolt \" A \" is from the 1930s .It was used by the Nazis to represent the Sturmabteilung , the Storm Troopers , also known as the Brown Shirts .These were Hitler 's bully - boys , the high - spirited lads who took to the streets to beat up Communists , Jews , free - thinkers , and anyone else considered to be an enemy of the German people .Is the resemblance of the SA symbol to the Antifa logo a coincidence ?I have no idea , but it 's a fitting emblem for the thugs who beat up the Jews and little old ladies who came to Cologne last weekend to protest Islamization .What bears the most striking resemblance to the methodology of the Storm Troopers is the symbiosis among the Antifa groups , the police , and local officials .The Autonomer are performing an identical function to that of the Sturmabteilung : they carry out illegal political violence on behalf of a totalitarian state which deems itself to be beyond the rule of law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "130.67957"}
