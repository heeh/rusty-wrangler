{"text": "We 're grateful .( Applause . )So tonight , as we gather to light the sixth candle of Hanukkah , we remember an enduring story of resilience and optimism .Over 2,000 years ago , a tyrant forbade the Israelites from practicing their religion and his forces desecrated the Holy Temple .So Judah Maccabee gathered a small band of believers to fight this oppression , and against all odds , they prevailed .And the Maccabees liberated Jerusalem and restored the faith of its people .And when they went to reclaim the Temple , the people of Jerusalem received another gift from God - the oil that should have lasted only one night burned for eight .That miraculous flame brought hope and it sustained the faithful .To this day , Jews around the world honor the Maccabees ' everlasting hope that light will overcome the darkness , that goodness will overcome evil , and that faith can accomplish miracles .The menorah that we 're using tonight and the man who will light it are both powerful symbols of that spirit .Six weeks ago , the Temple Israel Synagogue in Long Beach , New York , was badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy .But this 90-year - old menorah survived , and I am willing to bet it will survive another 90 years , and another 90 years after that .So tonight , it shines as a symbol of perseverance , and as a reminder of those who are still recovering from Sandy 's destruction - a reminder of resilience and hope and the fact that we will be there for them as they recover .So I want to thank Rabbi David Bauman for sharing your congregation 's blessed menorah with us .We pray that its light will carry victims of Sandy and all Americans to a brighter tomorrow .And we 're confident that it will .( Applause . )And we 're confident that it will because for centuries the menorah has served as a source of inspiration and courage for all those dreaming of a better future , and Rabbi Larry Bazer knows that as well as anybody .Now , we had hoped that Rabbi would join us to light the candles last year , but he was n't able to make it .We do n't get that very often .Usually when we invite people , they come .( Laughter . )But we gave him another chance because he had a pretty good excuse the first time .Last Hanukkah , Rabbi Bazer - and he happens to be the Joint Forces Chaplain for the Massachusetts National Guard - was four months into his deployment in Afghanistan , and he lit a custom - built electric menorah in the central square of Camp Phoenix in Kabul .As the only rabbi in Afghanistan at the time , he spent every night of Hanukkah with a different group of soldiers , reminding them of the Maccabees ' perseverance , and bringing them faith to guide their challenging work .Even in the face of great danger , the message of Hanukkah endures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.80009"}
