{"text": "Image caption Many Islamic groups see a ban on full - face veils as discrimination against Muslims .In January 2010 , then Schools Secretary Ed Balls said it was \" not British \" to tell people what to wear in the street after the UK Independence Party called for all face - covering Muslim veils to be banned .In September 2013 , Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne called for a \" national debate \" about Islamic veils in public places , such as schools .In 2014 UKIP came first in the European elections in Britain , winning 24 seats in Brussels .UKIP leader Nigel Farage has previously said that full veils are a symbol of an \" increasingly divided Britain \" , that they \" oppress \" women , and are a potential security threat .The Netherlands .Plans to impose a ban in the Netherlands under the country 's previous centre - right coalition were shelved in 2012 when the government collapsed and was replaced by its left - wing rivals .The earlier proposed ban reflected the influence of the anti - Islamist Geert Wilders , whose Freedom party was at that time the third largest in parliament and the minority coalition government 's chief ally .Image caption Populist politician Geert Wilders , of the anti - immigration Freedom Party , wants tougher policies on Islam .Attempts to introduce similar legislation in 2006 failed .Lawyers said it would probably be unconstitutional and critics said it would violate civil rights .Around 5 % of the Netherlands ' 16 million residents are Muslims , but only around 300 are thought to wear the niqab , which leaves the eyes uncovered , or the burka , which covers them with a cloth grid .The wearing of headscarves is far more common , however .Turkey .Image caption Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's wife , Emine , wears a headscarf .Scarves are banned in civic spaces and official buildings , but the issue is deeply divisive for the country 's predominantly Muslim population , as two - thirds of all Turkish women - including the wives and daughters of the prime minister and president - cover their heads .In 2008 , Turkey 's constitution was amended to ease a strict ban at universities , allowing headscarves that were tied loosely under the chin .Headscarves covering the neck and all - enveloping veils were still banned .In October 2013 , Turkey lifted rules banning women from wearing headscarves in the country 's state institutions - with the exception of the judiciary , military and police .The governing AK Party , with its roots in Islam , said the ban meant many girls were being denied an education .But the secular establishment said easing it would be a first step to allowing Islam into public life .Italy .Several towns in Italy have local bans on face - covering veils .The north - western town of Novara is one of several local authorities to have already brought in rules to deter public use of the Islamic veil .Governments have discussed extending the law to impose penalties on Muslim face coverings , but these have not yet been enforced nationally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.173096"}
