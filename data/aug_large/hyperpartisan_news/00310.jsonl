FB -0.21 % and Twitter Inc. are trying to turn political advertising into a big business , courting presidential candidates , political - action committees and interest groups to siphon off some of the billions of dollars spent on election ads .Over the past year , the companies have met with hundreds of political groups to tutor them on effective social - media ad strategies .They 've also staffed up to work with political campaigns to tailor ads to specific voters and snag ad dollars .\" We want to spend every waking moment talking to political advertisers about how they can use Twitter to win , \" said Peter Greenberger , Twitter 's head of political advertising sales and the executive who established Google Inc.

Federal Election Commission opened the floodgates of money flowing into an already money saturated American political system .Voters should be aware of who pays for political ads during election campaigns and understand how the court put democracy up for sale to anonymous high bidders .Citizens United is a 501(c)(4 ) nonprofit corporation known for promoting conservative positions .A 501(c)(4 ) organization can collect contributions from donors and may engage in political campaigning so long as its primary purpose is promoting \" social welfare \" causes .Unlike political action committees ( PACs ) , 501(c)(4 ) organizations are not required to disclose their contributors .In 2008 , Citizens United released a film titled , \" Hillary : The Movie . \"The film was critical of then - Sen .Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , who at the time was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination .Fearing regulatory action by the FEC , Citizens United filed an action in federal District Court against the FEC , arguing that certain campaign financing laws were unconstitutional if applied to the film .The District Court held in favor of the FEC .Eventually the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and was decided in favor of Citizens United by a 5 - 4 majority .That decision overturned earlier Supreme Court decisions and held unconstitutional certain campaign financing laws passed by Congress .The court 's majority went beyond the questions argued by Citizens United and issued a broad ruling that in essence declared that corporations and unions enjoy the same freedom of speech rights under the First Amendment as individuals .In other words , they ruled that corporations and unions are people and that money is speech .I agree with the dissenting opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens wherein he stated that legal entities are not \" we the people \" for whom our Constitution was established .\" A democracy can not function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold , \" he wrote .The Citizens United decision resulted in numerous applications for 501(c)(4 ) organizations being filed with the Internal Revenue Service by both conservative and liberal groups .Why ?Because these organizations are not required to disclose their contributors .Many wealthy donors prefer not to have their names associated with a political organization and the negative ads they frequently produce .Consequently , money donated to these organizations is known as \" dark money . \"Lower courts , citing the decision in Citizens United , also spawned super PACs .These decisions allowed unlimited contributions to PACs that make independent expenditures in support of candidates and campaigns , so long as they do not contribute directly to campaigns .As a result , super PACs poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the 2012 election to support candidates .Some of these super PACs have since morphed into 501(c)(4 ) organizations to protect donor anonymity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.61499"}

Boxer for choosing the people .It 's a nice idea ... but things have n't exactly worked out that way .Instead , Public Citizen reported last week , in the first election after Citizens United , groups funneling money to political activities have increasingly been hiding where their money comes from .Only 32 percent of the organizations broadcasting electioneering communications in the 2010 primary season revealed in their filings with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) the identities of donors funding their advertisements , according to Public Citizen 's analysis of FEC filings .In contrast , nearly 50 percent revealed their donors in the 2008 election cycle , and close to 100 percent did so in the 2004 and 2006 cycles .Electioneering communications are campaign ads run shortly before elections that focus on candidates but do n't expressly urge a vote for or against them .Only 10 percent of Republican groups disclosed their funders , in contrast to 50 percent of Democratic groups .This should n't come as a surprise .As Target learned the hard way this summer , shareholders , consumers , and voters are n't particularly keen on large corporations bankrolling political campaigns .Funneling money through secretive groups allows corporate political spenders to have the best of both worlds : they can fund the campaigns of candidates favorable to them , and never have to be held accountable .An attempt this summer to patch up the loophole that allows corporations to keep their election spending secret ran up against stiff opposition from corporate lobbyists and a unified filibuster from the GOP .President Obama summed up the result in his weekly radio address Saturday : .What is clear is that Congress has a responsibility to act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.49794"}
