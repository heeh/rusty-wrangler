{"text": "It was within this context of religious pluralism and conflict that Muslims had to deal with the problem of religious liberty .Over time , limits on religious liberty for non - Muslims were added .These included restrictions on the building of places of worship , public readings of Scripture and the ability of non - Muslims to engage publicly in certain activities that Muslims considered forbidden ( such as drinking alcohol ) if these non - Muslims were living in Muslim communities .It is far from clear how consistently or stringently these restrictions were applied in practice .Like apostasy law , they may have been used only at particular times of uncertainty , difficulty , or tensions with an external enemy .Although these restrictions have come to form an influential part of classical Islamic law , non - Muslims under Muslim rule generally have been granted the prerogative to manage their own affairs ( including religious affairs ) from the time of the Prophet Muhammad onward .This practice was adhered to in various Muslim empires ( from the Umayyad through to the Abbasid and the Ottoman ) .One example is the \" millet system \" established by the Ottoman Empire .One of the major challenges for the Ottomans was finding ways to govern the broad array of people , religions , cultures and languages contained within their empire .Under the millet system , the Ottomans gave people of various religious traditions the right to practice their own religion and preserved their places of worship , provided they recognized the Ottoman state and the superiority of Islam .With these arrangements in place , Ottoman society remained generally free of large - scale religious conflict for centuries .Even the Jews fleeing persecution in Spain found that they were welcome in Ottoman lands .This tolerance did not necessarily result in full equality or equal citizenship ( which are , in any case , relatively modern concepts even in the West ) , but non - Muslims nonetheless rose to prominence in many Muslim states .Returning to the Islamic sources of authority .Today there is some movement toward Muslim acceptance of religious liberty .Many Muslim - majority states have even signed and ratified the ICCPR , which contains the wording of Article 18 of the Universal Declaration , with some minor changes .The article reads : .Though they may continue to flout these ideals , the many Muslim - majority countries that have accepted this statement have , in some minimal legal sense , already committed themselves to the ideal of religious liberty .Sadly , the implementation of this standard continues to be painfully slow because of certain trends within Islam .At a time when a number of ultraconservative voices appear to be dominating the discourse in many parts of the Muslim world , Muslim scholars who advocate for religious liberty are fiercely opposed .They are often labelled as stooges of the West or accused of being apostates or heretics .Many such scholars in Muslim nations are imprisoned for their views or have their publications banned .My book Freedom of Religion and Apostasy in Islam was banned in the Maldives in 2008 after a targeted campaign against my co - author ( and brother ) Hassan Saeed by certain politicians and an ultraconservative group .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.82951"}

Wilson .The last person hanged for blasphemy in Great Britain was Thomas Aikenhead , aged 20 , in Scotland in 1697 .He was prosecuted for denying the veracity of the Old Testament and the legitimacy of Christ 's miracles .[ 1 ] The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were abolished in England and Wales in 2008 with the passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act .[ 2 ] Other countries to abolish or repeal blasphemy laws include France in 1881 , Sweden in 1970 , Norway with Acts in 2009 and 2015 , the Netherlands in 2014 , and Iceland in 2015 .Prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system , including blasphemy laws , are incompatible with the Covenant , except in the specific circumstances envisaged in article 20 , paragraph 2 , of the Covenant .Such prohibitions must also comply with the strict requirements of article 19 , paragraph 3 , as well as such articles as 2 , 5 , 17 , 18 and 26 .Thus , for instance , it would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favor of or against one or certain religions or belief systems , or their adherents over another , or religious believers over non - believers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.391525"}

{"text": "8 The writer goes on to add that Islamophobia provides \" the perfect rationale for modern Muslims to become reactive , addicted to a culture of complaint and blame that serves only to increase the powerlessness , impotence and frustration of being a Muslim . \"Open and Closed Views .Race equality organizations and activists over many years have failed to include Islamophobia in their programs and campaigns .For instance , why did the Race Relations Amendment Act fail to refer to anti - Muslim prejudice ?In order to begin to answer this question , it is useful to draw a key distinction between closed views of Islam , on the one hand , and open views , on the other .Phobic dread of Islam is the recurring characteristic of closed views .Legitimate disagreement and criticism , as well as appreciation and respect , are aspects of open views .They are therefore insensitive to significant differences and variations within the world of Islam and , in particular , they are unable to appreciate the existence of tensions and disagreements amongst Muslims .For example , they ignore debates about human rights and freedom in Muslim countries and contexts , about appropriate relationships between Islam and other world faiths , and between Islam and secularism .In short , debates and differences which are taken for granted amongst non - Muslims are neither seen nor heard when they take place within Islam .Sweeping generalizations are then made about all Muslims , in ways which would not happen in the case of , for example , all Roman Catholics , or all Germans , or all Londoners .Also , it is all too easy to argue from the particular to the general in the case of Muslims - any episode in which an individual Muslim is judged to have behaved badly is used as an illustrative example to condemn all Muslims without exception .Diversity within Islam , like diversity within other religions , is multi - faceted and multi - dimensional .Some of the differences that tend to be ignored or over - simplified in much Islamophobic discourse pertain to those between Muslims of various countries , such as between the Middle East and South Asia , or Iranians and Arabs .Other examples include the difference between Muslims who are profoundly critical of the human rights records of certain Muslim countries and those who maintain that such criticism is merely a symptom of Islamophobia .Another important difference is that between the diverse interpretations of terminologies , doctrines and injunctions in the Qur'an and Islamic traditions , and between major strands and paths in the twentieth century , such as Sufism and Islamism , or movements known as modernism and revivalism .A recurring phrase in the Western media nowadays is \" fundamentalism , \" This is not a helpful term .A brief history of the term recalls that it was coined as self - definition by a strand within Christianity and only much later , almost as a metaphor , to criticize aspects of Islam .Islam is the \" other , \" with few or no similarities between itself and other civilizations and cultures , and with few or no shared concepts and moral values .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.64297"}
