{"text": "For example , many people rely on these services to convert currency when traveling overseas .Individuals who go abroad often need cash to be exchanged into foreign bills .This is often safer than drawing funds from one 's bank account in certain outside countries and locations .In general , the value of a money order is predetermined by the sender before being wired to its recipient .In addition , most vendors that process these orders extract a small fee from the sender .Once the order has been processed , most services provide their customers with stubs and receipts to keep for their personal records .Money order vendors can be found in a wide variety of locations .For instance , in the United States , post offices regularly process money transfers .In addition , retailers such as grocery stores and convenience stores commonly convert currency and process orders for their customers .Like many money order services , many of these online vendors provide their customers with exchange rate information and many other important details .Before undergoing a money transfer online , it is best to research an online service 's credentials and make sure they are able to perform their duties competently .Since money and wire exchanges often involve large sums of cash , many laws and safeguards are put in place to ensure these operations are protected .In the United States , for instance , federal laws prohibit money orders from exceeding a thousand dollars .In addition , they are held to tight regulatory requirements in order to prevent counterfeiting and increase the safety and security of both senders and recipients .Overall , cash transfer services provide essential assistance to people around the globe .Sending money electronically through a money transfer service is a safe and secure way to send money quickly .There are many different types of money transfer services , both domestic and foreign that operate either in traditional storefronts , online or both .If you have never used a money transfer service before , below are some quick terms that outline the process .Money Order - One of the most common types of transfer services that works like a check .The buyer obtains the money order from a transfer service by paying in cash or credit card .The buyer then uses it to pay a bill .Because the cash from the money order is guaranteed , many businesses that do not accept personal checks will accept money orders .Currency Converter - Different countries have different types of currency , or money denominations .To transfer or send money overseas the currency will have to be converted from the sender 's currency to the receiver 's currency .This is done based on the exchange rate .Exchange Rate - The value of one type of currency compared against the value of another type of currency .For example , it would be the value of one American dollar against one Euro .Used when transferring money to foreign countries .Wire Service - Many transfer services use the term wire to refer to sending money to a recipient .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.42713"}

{"text": "And after years of sitting on its hands while competitors CVS ( NYSE : CVS ) and Walgreen ( NASDAQ : WBA ) have branched more deeply into the health - care supply chain , Rite Aid is finally able to start committing to growth again .Rite Aid inked a deal earlier this month to buy RediClinic , a Texas chain of retail health - care clinics .Since that deal kick - starts Rite Aid 's retail clinic business , let 's take a closer look at what the acquisition may mean for investors .Chasing the leaders CVS and Walgreen pioneered the pharmacy retail clinic concept , launching hundreds of clinics within their stores over the past few years .While both have made big inroads into this emerging care solution , CVS is the dominant player .CVS operates more than 800 MinuteClinic retail sites nationwide , including 74 new clinics opened in the fourth quarter alone .As a result , CVS ' MinuteClinic sales grew more than 10 % in the last three months of 2013 despite tough comparisons from the prior year tied to a particularly busy flu season .Those MinuteClinics are winning business away from primary care doctors and emergency rooms by targeting easy - to - address services such as flu shots , immunizations , blood pressure testing , and , more recently , care for chronic disease .The combination of convenience -- clinics mirror the hours of the stores -- and pricing is being embraced by payers eager to avoid expenses tied to high - cost health care .As a result , about 85 % of CVS MinuteClinic total sales last year were paid by employers and health insurance , rather than paid directly by patients .Rite Aid 's RediClinic strategy CVS and Walgreen may have a head start , but that does n't mean Rite Aid ca n't steal away market share .Especially if the company can leverage the RediClinic brand across multiple retailers .Currently , all 30 RediClinics are found in H.E.B. grocery stores in Texas .In fact , Rite Aid does n't now operate stores in the state .That suggests that Rite Aid has two opportunities to grow RediClinic .It can launch clinics in its own stores -- it plans to open 70 new RediClinics in the next year and a half -- or it can roll them out at regional grocers using the store - in - store concept .Since Rite Aid does n't operate stores in key retirement markets such as Texas and Florida , the ability to scale RediClinic as a stand - alone brand in those markets could be critical to the company 's long - term growth plans .According to Rite Aid 's fiscal fourth - quarter conference call , the company is open to pursuing both options .\"The real opportunity with RediClinic is to , I think , one , bring it to Rite Aid stores , and two , to continue to support their business like they 've done with their very good partner down in Texas , \" said CEO John Standley .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.33097"}
{"text": "The only bad thing about money orders and cashier 's checks is that you have to wait for them to arrive .Even if the buyer puts payment in the mail the very next day , you 'll still wait anywhere from three to five days after the auction to receive payment .Still , there 's not a lot to dislike about this method of payment - it 's hard to get burned with either a money order or cashier 's check .NOTE .Beware a common scam where a buyer sends you a money order or cashier 's check for an amount larger than the purchase price and then asks you to send funds for the difference .Do n't fall for this .Accept payment for the amount of the purchase only !There 's also the ( extremely slight ) possibility that you can receive a bad cashier 's check .To be precise , a cashier 's check or money order is n't exactly the same as cash ; your bank still needs to be reimbursed by the issuing institution , and if this does n't happen , the cashier 's check / money order will bounce - although this is highly unlikely .Be particularly careful of money orders or cashier 's checks drawn on foreign banks or issued by unfamiliar institutions .When in doubt , hold the merchandise and ask your bank to verify that the payment is good .Credit Cards .Until just a few years ago , if you wanted to accept credit card payment for your auction items , you had to be a big - time retailer , complete with merchant account and bank - supplied charge card terminal .This limited the number of sellers who could accept credit card payment , which probably cut down on potential bidders because many buyers like the convenience and relative safety of paying by credit card .Today , however , there are options available that enable you to accept credit card payments for your auction items .First , several financial institutions provide merchant credit card accounts for smaller retailers , as we 'll discuss later in this chapter .Second , you have PayPal - an online payment service that lets any auction seller easily accept credit card payments , with little or no setup hassle .PayPal works by accepting credit card payments from your customers and then sending you a check or depositing funds directly in your bank account for that amount - minus PayPal 's fee , of course .Any time you accept a credit card , with either a merchant account or PayPal , you are charged a fee - typically several percentage points of however much the buyer pays .When you consider that you have to pay eBay 's listing fee and final value fee , paying another few points for the convenience of accepting credit cards can really sock it to a small seller - or anyone selling a low - priced item .You should definitely research the payment service 's fees before you sign up .We 'll look at credit cards in more detail in the \" Accepting Credit Card Payments via PayPal \" section , later in this chapter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.43518"}

{"text": "An escrow service is a company that acts as a neutral third party between you and the buyer , holding the buyer 's money until the buyer receives the purchased merchandise .You get paid only when the buyer is satisfied , which is good protection for the buyer - but delays you receiving your money .Here 's how a typical escrow transaction works .Either during or just after the end of an auction , you and the buyer contact each other and agree to use an escrow service .The buyer sends payment ( by check , money order , cashier 's check , or credit card ) to the escrow service ; then - after the payment is approved - the escrow service notifies you and instructs you to ship the item .After the buyer receives the item , verifies its acceptability , and notifies the escrow service that all is hunky - dory , the escrow service pays you .The escrow service 's fees can be split between the two parties , but are more typically paid by the buyer .Fees differ widely from service to service .For what it 's worth , eBay recommends that customers use an escrow service when the transaction is over $ 500 and the seller does n't accept credit card or PayPal payments .So , if you accept credit card payments ( via PayPal or otherwise ) , you should n't have to bother with escrow .If you choose to use another escrow company , make sure that it 's bonded and legitimate ; there are some phony escrow companies operating on the Internet that you need to watch out for .A personal money order is a prepaid financial document that is signed and given to a recipient by an individual .Money orders are issued for a specified amount of money , and a personal one might be purchased at a post office or grocery store customer service counter .They are somewhat like a single - use bank checking account because the person who purchases the money order has control over the money and may place a stop payment on it if it is lost or stolen .Money orders usually cost a small fee on top of the value of the document .Essentially , a personal money order is like a certified check , but it has a limit on how much it can be worth .This differs from a personal check because the money is already pre - paid and held for payment , so it is a more reliable means of accepting non - cash payments .Value caps are set by the financial organization that issues the money order .If a person needs more than a money order will cover , he can purchase more than one .Ad .A bank money order is a different instrument , and it is purchased by a person but issued and often delivered to the recipient by a banking organization .They are more frequently used for international transactions because they can be purchased in the recipient 's currency for easy transfer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.12366"}

If you keep your money at home or hidden , you have no such protection and private insurance will only cover a limited amount of cash .This fact alone means you are taking on a huge risk of financial devastation through theft , fire , or forgetting where you hid it !Can you imagine the risk you carry if walking around with thousands of dollars to make a big purchase or getting a money order ! ?Next , you greatly raise your risk for fraud .Once you pay for services in cash , they have your money and if a problem with the service or product is discovered , you have to solve the problem yourself .With a bank / credit service , you can stop payment and report fraudulent service providers .Next , you do n't develop a credit history which can have a serious impact on your life .With regard to credit , having little to no credit history is viewed almost the same as having bad history in the eyes on banks .They want to see proof over time that you 're able to pay back what is borrowed in a timely manner .The time may come when you will have a need for having good credit such as starting a business , buying a car / house , traveling , etc .It is far better to have good credit and not make use of it rather than need it and not have it .Your credit record can also be reviewed by prospective employers , utilities and apartment rental companies among others as part of their approval process .People with little / no credit history will be at a disadvantage against those with good ratings and ironically , will be grouped in with those with bad credit history .Lastly , those on a cash only system lose out on getting any banking interest or investment income .Money on hand will lose value over time due to inflation .$ 100 tens years ago could buy a lot more than it can today .With no protection against inflation erosion , one 's net worth and buying power will continue to degrade over time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.008385"}
