Bill Clinton debating with President George H.W. Bush in 1992 .The senior George Bush hoped to raise questions about Clinton 's youthful opposition to the Vietnam War , a student trip he took to Moscow while a Rhodes scholar at Oxford , and rumors that he had tried to renounce his U.S. citizenship .So , the day before the debate , Bush 's staff handed the President what he called \" zingy \" comments .\" It 's hard to visit foreign countries with a torn - up passport , \" read one of the scripted lines .Another zinger read : \" Contrary to what the Governor 's been saying , most young men his age did not try to duck the draft . ...A few did go to Canada .A couple went to England .Only one I know went to Russia .\" Bush also hoped to use the trip to Moscow as a double whammy , highlighting both Clinton 's supposed lack of patriotism and his shortage of foreign policy experience .\" The Governor does have some foreign experience , \" read one zinger .\" We know he 's been to Moscow .\" Some of the \" zingers \" were both defensive and offensive .One was designed to counter a possible Clinton criticism about Bush 's official Texas residence at a Houston hotel .If Clinton raised that point , Bush was primed to hit back with another Russian reference : \" Where is your legal residence , Little Rock or Leningrad . \"Another \" zinger \" highlighted a rumor that Clinton had considered seeking Swedish citizenship .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.853516"}

{"text": "Which probably means we 'll be seeing more spooks getting paid by contractors on the side .Yesterday , WaPo described a reporting requirement that had been in the Senate Intelligence Authorization , but got watered down in the Omnibus : a report on promotions revealing whether those being promoted were \" unfit or unqualified .\" Under a provision drafted by the Senate Intelligence Committee this year , intelligence agencies would have been required to regularly provide names of those being promoted to top positions and disclose any \" significant and credible information to suggest that the individual is unfit or unqualified .\" WaPo makes clear this kind of failing upwards continues at CIA .More recently , a top CIA manager who had been removed from his job for abusive treatment of subordinates was reinstated this year as deputy chief for counterintelligence at the Counterterrorism Center .In short , the measure was meant to ensure that CIA ( and other agencies ) were n't led by a bunch of abusive incompetents .But James Clapper could n't allow that apparently , because abusive incompetents would apparently decline promotion if they would be revealed to oversight committees as abusive incompetents .U.S. officials offered multiple explanations for Clapper 's objections .Several said that his main concern was the bureaucratic workload that would be generated by legislation requiring so much detail about potentially hundreds of senior employees across the U.S. intelligence community .But others said that U.S. spy chiefs chafed at the idea of subjecting their top officials to such congressional scrutiny and went so far as to warn that candidates for certain jobs would probably withdraw .Lawmakers were told that \" some intelligence personnel would be reluctant to seek promotions out of concern that information about them would be presented to the Hill , \" said a U.S. official involved in the discussions .So he balked and Congress watered down the requirement .Here 's what remains of the measure : .( a ) DIRECTIVE REQUIRED.-The Director of National Intelligence shall issue a directive containing a written policy for the timely notification to the congressional intelligence committees of the identities of individuals occupying senior level positions within the intelligence community .So rather than preventing the CIA and other agencies from promoting abusive incompetents , the measure will likely lead to them being hidden further behind CIA 's secrecy .Which is interesting , especially given another Intel Authorization measure that survived in the Omnibus , that I earlier described as an effort to make sure spooks and those in sensitive positions are n't joining EFF or similar organizations .The committee description of this section explains it will require DNI to do more checks on spooks ( actually spooks and \" sensitive \" positions , which is n't full clearance ) .Among the things ODNI will use to investigate its spooks are social media , commercial data sources , and credit reports .Among the things it is supposed to track is \" change in ideology .\" I 'm guessing they 'll do special checks for EFF stickers and hoodies , which Snowden is known to have worn without much notice from NSA .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.26709"}
