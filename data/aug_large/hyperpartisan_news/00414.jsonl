Edward M. Kennedy was released from the hospital on Wednesday morning after suffering a seizure during an inaugural luncheon .Kennedy 's office confirmed that the senator left Washington Hospital Center , where he had been resting overnight for observation .A Kennedy representative , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement was not official , said the Massachusetts senator was in good spirits and that doctors wanted him to get some rest .Doctors on Tuesday had blamed fatigue for the seizure .Kennedy , who has been under treatment for a brain tumor since last spring , suffered the seizure during an inaugural luncheon after attending the swearing - in of President Barack Obama .He talked with family and friends and felt well while he was at the hospital , according to a statement released by his office on Tuesday .The 76-year - old Democrat was diagnosed last May with a particularly aggressive type of brain tumor and has been treated with surgery , radiation and chemotherapy .Kennedy 's seizure at the inaugural lunch was witnessed by fellow senators .Longtime friend Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn . , quoted Kennedy as saying , \" I 'll be OK , I 'll see you later \" as he was put into an ambulance on Tuesday .Kennedy had appeared in good health and spirits a few hours earlier when he stepped out of the Capitol and onto the inauguration platform where Obama took the oath of office .At the luncheon , Obama told lawmakers his prayers were with the senator and his family .Kennedy has pledged to forge a breakthrough on health care reform working with Obama and Democrats who control Congress .Kennedy has been a leading champion of health care reform for decades .A doctor not connected with the senator 's care , Dr. Matthew Ewend , neurosurgery chief at the University of North Carolina , said it 's not unusual for patients recovering from brain tumors to suffer seizures .Kennedy Diagnosed With Malignant Brain Tumor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.84796"}
