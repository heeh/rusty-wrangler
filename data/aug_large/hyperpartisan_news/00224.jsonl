Trey Gowdy ( R - SC ) .CDC : Ladies , Do n't Drink Unless You 're On Birth Control .Friday , February 5 .By Christine Rousselle .In a rare show of bipartisanship , women of all political persuasions are furious after the Center for Disease Control released an infographic and report that suggested that women of childbearing age avoid all alcohol unless they are using some form of contraception .While the goal of preventing fetal alcohol syndrome is laudable , many are criticizing the \" scare tactics , \" \" Puritanical attitude , \" and condescending nature of the CDC 's suggestion .Now , I know I 'm not a biologist , but I feel like there 's a missing step between \" drinking alcohol \" and \" getting pregnant .\" I had a glass of wine with dinner last night , and I 'm pretty sure I did n't spontaneously get pregnant or an STD as a result .While alcohol certainly can lower a person 's inhibitions , it definitely does n't make a person pregnant by itself .Christie Doubles Down on ' Boy in the Bubble ' Comment , Hammers Rubio on Youth , Inexperience .Friday , February 5 .By Cortney O'Brien .A few days ago in New Hampshire , Gov. Chris Christie called his presidential rival Marco Rubio the \" boy in the bubble . \"He was referring to Rubio 's supposed lack of face time with voters , instead relying on manufactured town halls and scripted answers .Yet , pundits ca n't help thinking the New Jersey governor was also targeting Rubio 's youth .Judge for yourself : .\" We know who the boy in the bubble is up here who never answers your questions , who 's constantly scripted and controlled because he ca n't answer your questions , \" Christie said .\"So when Senator Rubio gets here , when the boy in the bubble gets here , I hope you ask him some questions .The New Jersey governor had no intention of backtracking on the controversial comment in an interview with Fox News ' Greta Van Susteren : . \" The reason it applies to him is because he is not ready to be president of the United States .He is not ready because of the way he - not only his lack of accomplishment in his Senate career but also because he lives a very protected life as a candidate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.441765"}

{"text": "Des Moines Register :The Democratic Iowa Caucus ' Was A Debacle ' .Friday , February 5 .By Matt Vespa .You heard about the suspicions within the Democratic caucuses in Iowa Monday night .Delegates being assigned to Clinton over Sanders via coin tosses and 90 precincts having irregular voting counts .In the words of Donald Trump , it was a \" total disaster , \" and the Des Moines Register seems to have agreed : .What happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle , period .Democracy , particularly at the local party level , can be slow , messy and obscure .But the refusal to undergo scrutiny or allow for an appeal reeks of autocracy .[ ... ] .First of all , the results were too close not to do a complete audit of results .Two - tenths of 1 percent separated Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton .A caucus should not be confused with an election , but it 's worth noting that much larger margins trigger automatic recounts in other states .Second , too many questions have been raised .Too many accounts have arisen of inconsistent counts , untrained and overwhelmed volunteers , confused voters , cramped precinct locations , a lack of voter registration forms and other problems .Too many of us , including members of the Register editorial board who were observing caucuses , saw opportunities for error amid Monday night 's chaos .The Sanders campaign is rechecking results on its own , going precinct by precinct , and is already finding inconsistencies , said Rania Batrice , a Sanders spokeswoman .The campaign seeks the math sheets or other paperwork that precinct chairs filled out and were supposed to return to the state party .They want to compare those documents to the results entered into a Microsoft app and sent to the party .\" Let 's compare notes .Let 's see if they match , \" Batrice said Wednesday .Dr. Andy McGuire , chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party , dug in her heels and said no .She said the three campaigns had representatives in a room in the hours after the caucuses and went over the discrepancies .McGuire knows what 's at stake .Her actions only confirm the suspicions , wild as they might be , of Sanders supporters .Their candidate , after all , is opposed by the party establishment - and was n't even a Democrat a few months ago .So her path forward is clear : Work with all the campaigns to audit results .Break silly party tradition and release the raw vote totals .Provide a list of each precinct coin flip and its outcome , as well as other information sought by the Register .Be transparent .During the Democratic debate in New Hampshire last night , Sanders pretty much said that this is n't the biggest of issues that face the 2016 race right now ( via the Hill ): .\" This is not like a winner - take - all thing .I think where we now stand , correct me if I 'm wrong , you have 22 delegates , I have 20 delegates , we need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination , \" he said , regarding rival Hillary Clinton .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.05768"}

{"text": "Death in Mississippi .There has been much ado made of the case of Cory Maye , an inmate on death row in Mississippi .Rightfully so , in my opinion .This case smacks of everything that opponents of the death penalty claim is wrong with the system .I support the death penalty as a retributive form of punishment that society demands .I also think that the death penalty should be fairly applied in those cases where the facts support it .I do n't feel that the facts ( as reported ) support the death penalty in this case .The facts are basically this : Cory Maye is ( was ) a law - abiding citizen of Prentiss , MS .The police department was executing a search warrant for drugs at the house where Maye was living .The police were unaware that the house was a duplex and when they executed the warrant , they broke into the wrong side of the house .Maye heard people breaking into his home , late at night .He was there with his 18-month old daughter .Maye used a firearm against the intruders who then identified themselves as police officers .Maye was convicted of killing a police officer and is currently on death row in Mississippi .The defense team claims that Maye was improperly convicted , both on the facts of the case and the make - up of the jury .It helps to understand that Maye is black and the jury was white .It helps us to understand the verdict when we learn that the officer killed was the son of the local Chief of Police .If the facts in this case are as presented , then it is a tragedy of the worst sort .Any time an officer is killed , it is a tragedy .Any time a man is wrongly convicted , it is a tragedy .Any time racism rears its ugly head , it is a tragedy .There may be more tragedies here that I have n't identified .Police officers know that serving no - knock warrants is a dangerous exercise .Specialized training , briefing , and rehearsal is necessary before executing such a warrant .Timing is everything .Speed and surprise are necessary to overwhelm the senses of the occupants so that by the time the occupants think \" What the Hell is going on ? \" , the operation is over .This operation went dreadfully wrong , and in a residence where it was n't supposed to occur .The fact that a police officer is dead is a testament to the danger that such operations entail .Yet , Cory Maye was defending his family against violent intruders in the early morning hours .I ca n't fault him for that .The one saving grace of this case is that it is subject to review at the appelate level .I 'm sure that a good defense team will mitigate the sentence , and may be able to get it overturned on any number of grounds , not the least of which is that it seems like a miscarriage of justice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.77333"}
