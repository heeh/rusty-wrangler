Phillip , File ) - David J. Phillip .SAN JOSE , Calif. - The Denver Broncos and their top defense have n't seen anything quite like Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers , the No . 1 scoring offense in the league .The Panthers ( 17 - 1 ) are on a roll , jumping on playoff opponents early .The primary question on Sunday might not be whether they 'll win the franchise 's first Vince Lombardi Trophy , but if they 'll hand the Broncos another Super Bowl blowout .\" I think it 's his moment , \" Panthers coach Ron Rivera said of Newton , \" as well as it 's our moment , \" .The Panthers have feasted on pocket passers all season , the latest example being Carson Palmer , who committed six turnovers in Carolina 's 49 - 15 win over Arizona in the NFC championship .Carolina 's defense , which led the league in takeaways , quickly shifts from good to great when the offense gives them a lead .They have nine takeaways and eight sacks in the postseason .Luke Kuechly , one of three All - Pro players on defense , has two interception returns for touchdowns in the playoffs . \"Mike Tolbert and Stew ( Jonathan Stewart ) make their play - action game go , \" said Broncos defensive back T.J. Ward . \" So if we stop the run , we stop the beginning of what they do , that helps the rest of their offense .\" That 's a good plan , but executing it has proven to be a little more difficult .The Panthers have run for at least 100 yards in 31 straight games , including the playoffs .To put that in perspective , no other team has a streak longer than six games .Newton is a big part of that , rushing for 636 yards and 10 touchdowns , tying Steve Young 's record for career TDs by a quarterback .The game 's most versatile player , Newton shattered the myth that he 's just a running quarterback long ago .But he 's taken his passing to a whole different level this season , improving his accuracy and throwing for a career - high 35 touchdowns .He 's been lights out in the red zone , throwing 24 touchdowns with no interceptions . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.344696"}

{"text": "Yet this is to misread not merely libertarianism , but even Randianism itself .For Romney 's \" 47 percent \" remarks ( which observers should note , tied the capacity for virtuous citizenship purely to paying taxes ) were not libertarian .Rather , they were feudal .Romney posited a theory of two static classes , inexorably opposed to each other : the virtuous , taxpaying business owners / otherwise wealthy people , and the ungrateful serfs who pay nothing into the system and leech off their largesse .Similarly , someone who was once part of the upper echelons of the 53 percent could utterly destroy their own fortune due to hubris and criminal behavior , thus ending up in the 47 percent .This is how mobility works , and it 's one of the most important defenses of capitalism there is , having been made by the likes of Thomas Sowell and Milton Friedman .Ayn Rand herself acknowledged this when , in Atlas Shrugged , she cast figures such as the diner employee and former professor Hugh Akston ( who is not a wealthy man ) as explicitly more virtuous than the wealthy but corrupt subsidized steel magnate Orren Boyle .That being said , upward mobility is in woefully short supply in America today , and libertarian populists ( especially Carney himself ) are often brilliant in their exposition of the reasons why .In fact , much of their policy program would probably do a great deal to ameliorate the lack of upward mobility , and to eliminate the Orren Boyles of the world .Unfortunately , the libertarian virtues of their policy program are almost entirely voided by the utterly counterproductive decision to we d that program to populist policies , ideas and rhetoric .Before getting into why , let us return to Rand for a moment , because she works as a particularly extreme example of what many libertarians believe ( she certainly was a gateway drug for me ) .If her message ( and , indeed , libertarianism 's ) really were the feudal nightmare that Romney 's critics make it out to be , there would be no way to explain the enormous mass appeal of books like Atlas Shrugged .There are simply not enough millionaires and billionaires to inflate sales that much , nor to explain its pop cultural impact , nor to explain the fact that it appeals just as much to entirely resourceless high school and college students as it does to the independently wealthy .So why the appeal ?Simple : Because Rand 's work , for all its many flaws , is not a feudal fantasy , but an aspirational one .Indeed , libertarianism is perhaps the perfect aspirational philosophy .Populism , by contrast , is almost entirely punitive .It seeks to drag down those who have achieved more than they ought to , to get revenge on the successful and to glorify the unsuccessful .Rush Limbaugh fingered this as precisely the reason why populism is a poor fit on the right in 2008 when he used it as a reason to criticize Mike Huckabee .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.36338"}
