{"text": "\" But it is almost impossible to get a number on which everyone can agree .Organizers of events have every incentive to inflate the numbers , and there 's often not anyone else to provide an independent estimate .Raleigh police stopped doing crowd estimates more than a decade ago , said spokesman Jim Sughrue .Doig counted crowds at Glenn Beck 's \" Restoring the Honor \" rally in 2010 and President Obama 's 2008 inauguration , both in Washington .He said organizers and supporters at both events inflated the crowd estimates .It is \" absolutely human for event organizers to over - inflate attendance and for critics to underestimate the numbers , \" he said .The Moral March started shortly after 10:30 a.m. at the intersection of South Wilmington and South streets and continued along a six - block route that included one block on Davie Street before ending at the top of Fayetteville Street .By 11:50 a.m. , three blocks of Fayetteville Street were filled with a continuous procession of marchers , while at the starting point many more stood waiting to begin .Peter Anlyan produced a crowd estimate for the march 's organizers .Anlyan , a Durham - based corporate consultant who formerly worked as a television producer for Capitol Broadcasting Company and as a general manager with the Durham Bulls , has been responsible for the behind - the - scenes logistics for the Historic Thousands on Jones marches since they began in 2007 .Anlyan called his number of 70,000 to 80,000 \" a guess - estimate . \"\" It 's not official in anyway , \" he said .Anlyan noted that there were three to four times as many tour buses as there had been at previous rallies .He also worked closely with Raleigh police during the march 's planning stages and , anticipating a large turnout , asked them if Fayetteville Street could handle 60,000 people . \" The police said there are 80,000 to 90,000 people at First Night on Fayetteville Street with fair rides , game booths and vendor booths , so there should n't be a problem , \" he said .\" We had all people , with no booths or games . \"Anlyan said three blocks of Fayetteville Street , downtown 's main street , were filled with marchers .He calculated that the street was filled at nearly four - fifths its capacity , meaning 50,000 to 60,000 people were on the street .At the same time , Anlyan noted that there were rally participants on the State Capitol grounds , on Morgan Street and in parking decks .He said the parking lot that spilled off Fayetteville Street onto Lenoir Street , as well as the lawn of the Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts and Shaw University campus , were filled with thousands of people , even after the march began .Flabbergasted ' .Anlyan said that 45 minutes after the march began , people were still waiting to get started .\" I was flabbergasted at the number of people still waiting , \" he said . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.65802"}
