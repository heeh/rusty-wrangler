Bush and the Democratic loss of 2000 after eight years of Bill Clinton .Political scientist Larry Bartels of Vanderbilt University calls this phenomenon \" incumbent party fatigue . \" In his statistical model for presidential elections , he calculates that the incumbent party loses almost 1 percentage point of the popular vote for every additional year it holds the White House .What do presidents Benjamin Harrison , Rutherford B.

Kennedy vs. Richard M. Nixon .Starting in 1960 , Latinos recognized that their vote could be significant in presidential races , especially very close races .Early in the year , \" Viva Kennedy \" clubs were organized by Mexican - American activists in nine states to support the election of John F. Kennedy to the presidency in the 1960 Presidential election .The general election held on November 8 , 1960 was one of the closest in history .More than sixty - eight million votes were cast , with Kennedy receiving 34,221,344 votes ( 49.72 % ) and Nixon taking 34,106,671 votes ( 49.55 % ) , a plurality of only 114,673 votes ( less than 1/5 of one percent ) .Kennedy received 303 electoral votes to Nixon 's 219 .With such a small margin of victory , many political analysts believe that the Hispanic vote actually helped Kennedy to win .Although Latinos made up a very small portion of the electorate , they voted in large numbers for Kennedy , who received about 85 % of the national Hispanic vote .Even more significant is the fact that Kennedy received 91 % of the Hispanic vote in Texas , a state with a significant Mexican - American population .However , even with the Latino vote , Kennedy 's victory in Texas was by a razor - thin margin , having carried the state by only 46,000 votes .Kennedy also carried Illinois by only 9,000 votes , another state in which the Latino vote had been mobilized by the \" Viva Kennedy \" movement .1964 - Lyndon Baines Johnson vs. Barry Goldwater .The November 3 , 1964 Presidential Election provided with Lyndon Baines Johnson with 42,825,463 votes , or 61 % of the total popular vote , while Barry Goldwater received only 27,146,969 , or 38.4 % of the popular vote .In this case , the Latino vote was not considered crucial to Johnson 's victory .However , according to the former public policy analyst and author , Jos\u00e9 de la Isla , Lyndon Baines Johnson received 90 % of the Mexican - American vote and 86 % of the Puerto Rican vote in his 1964 election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.64711"}

Bush .Gore lost because Bush won a majority of the electoral votes , which are allocated to the winner of the popular vote in each state .Gore took the national vote because he received an excess of support in California , New York and other large , heavily Democratic states .NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd said this type of \" split result \" is unlikely this year , but he observed that the McCain camp may be banking on it anyway . \" The McCain folks realize their only path now is an Electoral College path , \" Todd said .\" It 's very hard for him to win the popular vote . \"And RealClearPolitics gives the Democratic candidate a 7.3 point lead in its recent average of national polls .According to Todd , McCain may not be able to overcome this gap because Obama is saturating the airwaves with ads .These television spots should help Obama run up decent vote numbers - even in states he is likely to lose .The Democratic candidate is also is likely to win big in populous states like California and Illinois , padding his vote total even further .At the same time , Todd said , McCain could still win the presidency by squeaking by in just enough states to get the 270 votes needed to snag an Electoral College victory .\" You throw all that together and it is conceivable that Obama wins the popular vote by three or four million and he loses the Electoral College , \" Todd said , adding : \" I do n't think it is a big chance . \" Not the first time If there is a split result this year , it would be just the fifth time in U.S. history that the candidate receiving a plurality of the popular vote did not become president .Previous instances include the elections of 1824 , 1876 , 1888 , and of course 2000 .The 2004 presidential election almost had a similar outcome .Bush defeated John Kerry by more than three million votes in that contest , and he won the Electoral College , 286 - 252 .But if just 100,000 Bush voters in Ohio had chosen Kerry instead , then the Democrat would have won the state and the election despite losing the popular vote .Silver actually projects that McCain , not Obama , has a better chance of winning the popular vote but losing the Electoral College .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.618706"}

Bernie Sanders won all the Democratic votes .Kasich came away with three while business mogul Donald Trump won two .On the Democratic side , Sanders received four .The results are a welcome sign for Kasich , whose campaign said he actively reached out to all nine voters who voted early Tuesday near the Canadian border in the first balloting of the New Hampshire primary .The small groups of voters in the communities of Dixville Notch , Hart 's Location , and Millsfield all participated today in the idealized New Hampshire tradition of voting en masse at midnight when polls open .The votes of those communities - particularly Dixville Notch - are given outsize importance as predictors of who will go on to larger victories in the presidential race .From This Week : Why are these voters able to cast their ballots so early ?Under New Hampshire law , communities that have fewer than 100 voters can open their polls at midnight and close them once registered voters have cast their ballots , The Boston Globe reports .All nine voters in Dixville Notch are employees of the Balsams Grand Resort Hotel , and they voted inside a building on the property .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.54166"}

Humphrey by fewer than 40,000 votes .Some GOP strategists figured that a shift as small as 5 percent in the Mexican - American votes would have carried the state 's 26 electoral votes for the Republican ticket .1972 - Richard M. Nixon Vs .George McGovern .In November 's Presidential contest , Nixon won by a landslide , garnering 46,740,323 votes ( 60.7 % ) against the Democratic candidate , George McGovern , who polled only 28,901,598 votes , or 37.5 % of the popular vote .Nixon won the electoral vote over Mc - Govern by 520 to 17 .Among the other candidates , John G. Schmitz of the American Party , received more than a million votes , or 1.4 % of the popular vote .In 1972 , President Richard Nixon took steps to get a larger share of the Hispanic vote .Even before the 1972 election , explains Jos\u00e9 de la Isla , President Nixon had already named some fifty Spanish - speaking civil servants , mostly Mexican Americans , to top government positions .( By contrast , the Johnson administration had named only six Spanish - speaking officeholders ) .In 1972 , the Latino voting age population numbered 5,616,000 , of which only 44.4 % were registered to vote .According to the Federal Election Commission , 2,103,000 Hispanics voted in the 1972 election .In the end , the Spanish Speaking Committee for the Re - election of President Nixon was able to help Nixon win 35 % of the Hispanic vote in the 1972 Presidential Election .This was a significant gain over Nixon 's 1968 performance with the Hispanic electorate .1976 - Gerald R.

Bush ( 2000 & 2004 ) , Jimmy Carter ( 1976 ) , and Richard Nixon ( 1968 ) all had smaller margins of victory than Obama did .This means that the bluster coming from the right about President Obama not having a mandate is nothing more than political hot air .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.86278"}
