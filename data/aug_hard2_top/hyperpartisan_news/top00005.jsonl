{"text":"Aside from TV , anyone glancing at a magazine stand in a newsagent 's can not help but be bombarded by images of the super skinny and those that have fallen off the diet wagon .These have an even more schizophrenic approach to weight by berating stars with sticking - out collarbones on one page before mocking someone else 's orange - peel thighs on the next .However , whilst it may feed into the insecurities of young women and even some men , I do n't think the media can be blamed for eating disorders altogether .Disorders like anorexia and bulimia can not be reduced to ' diets taken too far ' but are complex psychological problems that give the sufferer a very distorted perception of reality .Eating disorders as real medical problems are about more than a desire to be thin .The sufferer has a ' disordered ' relationship with food that can take years to correct and in some cases will never become healthy .The feeling towards food is often comparable to a phobia to the point where some people will feel great fear when faced with something a healthy eater would see as a tiny snack .The most important thing when dealing with a sufferer of an eating disorder is compassionate .Making them feel bad about the harm they are doing to themselves will only increase their feelings of shame and guilt and exacerbate their condition .Mollycoddling them will not help either .The person needs to know that you will be there to help them but it is ultimately up to them to change their behaviour with the help of trained professionals .Very difficult to find an exact cause ; early intervention is essential to help sufferers .There are many and varied arguments as to the cause of eating disorders , such as anorexia , bulimia and compulsive eating , and it seems unlikely that we 'll ever find a definitive answer .It seems to me that there are many factors involved in how people develop these terrible conditions .In recent years there has been so much media attention on celebrities ' weight ; it has become something of a national obsession !","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"49.61561"}
