A neuron communicates to other neurons by sending output pulses ( or \" spikes \" ) to other neurons .For simplicity , we only keep track of the rate $ r(i)$ of these spikes .Since a negative rate is n't meaningful , we know that $ r(i ) \\ge 0$. Only when the input exceeds some threshold $ I_0 $ does the neuron begin emitting output spikes .The output rate increases as $ i$ increases , as illustrated in this graph of $ r(i)$. ( The curve levels off for high values of $ i$ because there is a limit on how fast the neuron can emit output spikes .For example , the limit might be 200 spikes per second . )By differentiable , we mean that we can fit the graph of $ r(i)$ with a ( non - vertical ) tangent line .The graph of $ r$ has a kink there , so no matter what line we chose , it will fail to match the graph on either the left or the right side of $ I_0$. We can find a particular value of the slope $ m$ so that the line $ L(i)$ is a very good approximation for $ r(i)$ when $ i$ is close to $ a$. For this particular value of $ m$ , the line $ L(i)$ is called the the linear approximation to $ r(i)$ around $ a$. This line is , of course , the tangent line to $ r$.

The graph of the function has a tangent plane at the location of the green point , so the function is differentiable there .By rotating the graph , you can see how the tangent plane touches the surface at the that point .You can move the green point anywhere on the surface ; as long as it is not along the fold of the graph ( where the red point in constrained to be ) , you can see the tangent plane showing that the function is differentiable .There is no tangent plane to the graph at any point along the fold of the graph ( you can move the red point to any point along this fold ) .The function $ r(i , s)$ is not differentiable at any point along the fold .As further evidence of this non - differentiability , the tangent plane jumps to a different angle when you move the green point across the fold .If $ r(i , s)$ is differentiable at $ ( a_1,a_2)$ , that means $ r$ is nearly linear for $ ( i , s)$ near $ ( a_1,a_2)$. What are these special values of $ m$ and $ n$ ?","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"126.83515"}
