Goodin , Thomas Schillemans , ( 2012 ) .Abstract . Private-and public - sector employers face a recurring organizational - design dilemma : the relative emphasis to place on process - versus - outcome accountability in evaluating employee performance .This chapter reviews experimental - psychological research that emphasizes the benefits of process accountability and then notes blind spots in that literature , especially the insensitivity to the relational signals that accountability manipulations convey about how evaluators view the evaluated .The chapter also examines real - world ideologically - driven debates over accountability design in which partisans tend to favor no - excuses forms of outcome accountability for those deemed untrustworthy and uncertainty - buffering forms of process accountability for the trustworthy .Finally , an integrative framework is proposed that examines how managers can balance the inevitable tradeoffs between decision - making control enhanced under process accountability and innovation fostered under outcome accountability and sheds light on how agent empowerment can compensate for the deficiencies of both systems .Shefali Patil , Ferdinand Vieider , Philip Tetlock , \" Process and outcome accountability \" .In Oxford Handbook of Public Accountability , edited by Mark Bovens , Robert E.

Bartels argued , \" the political ignorance of the American voter is one of the best documented data in political science .\" On its own , this might not be a problem : People ignorant of the facts could simply choose not to vote .But instead , it appears that misinformed people often have some of the strongest political opinions .A striking recent example was a study done in the year 2000 , led by James Kuklinski of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .He led an influential experiment in which more than 1,000 Illinois residents were asked questions about welfare - the percentage of the federal budget spent on welfare , the number of people enrolled in the program , the percentage of enrollees who are black , and the average payout .More than half indicated that they were confident that their answers were correct - but in fact only 3 percent of the people got more than half of the questions right .Perhaps more disturbingly , the ones who were the most confident they were right were by and large the ones who knew the least about the topic .( Most of these participants expressed views that suggested a strong antiwelfare bias . )Studies by other researchers have observed similar phenomena when addressing education , health care reform , immigration , affirmative action , gun control , and other issues that tend to attract strong partisan opinion .Kuklinski calls this sort of response the \" I know I 'm right \" syndrome , and considers it a \" potentially formidable problem \" in a democratic system .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"82.377884"}

Wal - Mart .It explains how the normal rules of evidence law should apply to social framework expert testimony , and under the flexible and permissive standards of the Federal Rules of Evidence , framework testimony offered by a qualified expert should be admissible in many employment class actions .The argument that this kind of evidence should always be excluded is driven as much by a particular view of employment discrimination law as by the governing evidentiary rules .Ultimately , the arguments for blanket exclusion of social framework testimony in these cases can best be understood as part of a political debate and a litigation strategy .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"83.47987"}

A neuron communicates to other neurons by sending output pulses ( or \" spikes \" ) to other neurons .For simplicity , we only keep track of the rate $ r(i)$ of these spikes .Since a negative rate is n't meaningful , we know that $ r(i ) \\ge 0$. Only when the input exceeds some threshold $ I_0 $ does the neuron begin emitting output spikes .The output rate increases as $ i$ increases , as illustrated in this graph of $ r(i)$. ( The curve levels off for high values of $ i$ because there is a limit on how fast the neuron can emit output spikes .For example , the limit might be 200 spikes per second . )By differentiable , we mean that we can fit the graph of $ r(i)$ with a ( non - vertical ) tangent line .The graph of $ r$ has a kink there , so no matter what line we chose , it will fail to match the graph on either the left or the right side of $ I_0$. We can find a particular value of the slope $ m$ so that the line $ L(i)$ is a very good approximation for $ r(i)$ when $ i$ is close to $ a$. For this particular value of $ m$ , the line $ L(i)$ is called the the linear approximation to $ r(i)$ around $ a$. This line is , of course , the tangent line to $ r$.

{"text":"Forged Under Fire - Bob Mueller and Jim Comey 's Unusual Friendship .The sun had already been up for over an hour by the time James Comey and Bob Mueller approached the West Wing of the White House shortly after 7 AM on March 12 , 2004 .Neither had slept much in the previous week .The weather was windy and cool ; the thermometer hovered just over 40 degrees as they prepared to brief the president .The enormous Old Executive Office Building , once home to the nation 's entire State and War Departments , loomed over the back of the SUV .A stream of White House staff passed back and forth between the two buildings , their coveted ID badges slipped into shirt pockets or dangling from their necks .At that hour , many were on the way to or from the White House mess , the navy 's small cafeteria in the basement of the executive mansion .Comey , introspective by instinct , paused for a moment , considering what lay ahead ; Mueller , never much for reflection , did not .Sitting in their desks at the Justice Department and the Bureau were letters of resignation , which they expected to submit over the weekend ; a dozen other Justice and Bureau officials would join them .They would have submitted the letters already , except that the attorney general 's chief of staff had asked them to wait until the hospitalized John Ashcroft had recuperated enough to resign as well .This storm would be different : The entire leadership of the Justice Department and the FBI would go in one fell swoop over a controversy that no one would talk about and no one outside of a small group in government even knew that was brewing .That dramatic week had united the two men - both career public servants - deepening a friendship forged in the crucible of the highest levels of the national security apparatus after the 9/11 attacks .The two men are deeply alike , sharing a background and core principles .Both educated at Virginia universities with a strong public service tradition ( Mueller at the University of Virginia ; Comey at William & Mary ) .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"84.385864"}
