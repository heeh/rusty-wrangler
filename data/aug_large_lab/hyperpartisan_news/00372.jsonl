{"text":"Hurricanes and Global Warming .Since warm ocean waters and warm , moist air fuel storms , theory predicts that global warming should increase the number and intensity of tropical cyclones .As the oceans soak up extra heat from the atmosphere , ocean surface temperatures rise , increasing the extent of warm water that can support a hurricane .Not only should this mean that more hurricanes can form , but increased ocean surface temperatures could also increase a storm 's maximum potential intensity , the strongest a storm can get in ideal conditions .Models based on scientists ' current understanding of hurricanes suggest that if ocean temperatures increased by 2 - 2.5 degrees , the average intensity of hurricanes would increase by 6 to 10 percent .Since 1970 , the average ocean temperature has warmed about half a degree , which means that theoretically , storms could be one to three percent stronger .Such an increase translates to a few knots in wind speed , too small a change to accurately measure .Hurricane wind speeds have historically been measured in increments of five knots , so any increase in intensity that has already occurred as a result of global warming would , in theory , be too small to detect yet .However , in 2005 and 2006 , several studies suggested that global warming may be impacting hurricanes more than theory predicts .In an analysis of the historical record , there appeared to be an increase in the number of intense ( Category 4 and 5 ) storms in recent years .Another analysis charted sea surface temperatures and the number of tropical cyclones .It revealed that as sea surface temperatures went up , the number of cyclones went up .Was the increase in sea surface temperatures responsible for the increased number of storms or did some outside factor drive both ?Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 28 , 2005 .The Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA 's Terra satellite took this picture as the hurricane approached the Gulf Coast .Hurricane Katrina sparked public and scientific debate about the role of global warming in hurricane frequency and intensity .( NASA image courtesy the MODIS Rapid Response Team at Goddard Space Flight Center . )The studies triggered many questions .Both theory and the studies suggested that there should be a link between global warming and hurricanes , but the studies showed a much greater increase in storm frequency and intensity than theory predicted .What caused the discrepancy ?Is humanity 's current understanding of hurricanes flawed ?Can the theory be adjusted to explain why hurricanes would have a stronger reaction to warming than previously predicted ?One theory put forth to explain the recent increase in storm intensity and frequency in the Atlantic basin is the multi - decadal oscillation .Storms in the Atlantic may go through a natural cycle of 20 - 30 years of increased activity followed by a quieter period .The record seems to show such a cycle , with more intense hurricanes in the 1950s and 1960s followed by two decades of relative quiet , and then increased intensity from the mid-1990s to the present .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"46.853737"}

Therefore , the reasoning goes , global warming will lead to increased ocean temperatures and , presumably , more tropical cyclones .Yet recent work with climate models and historical data suggests that this scenario is overly simplistic .Other factors , such as atmospheric buoyancy , instabilities in the wind flow , and the differences in wind speed at various heights ( vertical wind shear ) , also play a role in the storms ' development .Beyond enabling this rather broad insight , though , climate models have proved of limited use in predicting changes in cyclone activity .Part of the problem is that the simulations are not yet detailed enough to model the very intense inner core of a cyclone .The historical data are only slightly more useful because they , too , are imperfect .It has been impossible to establish a reliable global record of variability of tropical cyclones through the 20th century because of changes in observing systems ( such as the introduction of satellites in the late 1960s ) and population changes in tropical areas .Nevertheless , there are good records of cyclone activity in the North Atlantic , where weather aircraft have reconnoitered since the 1940s .Christopher W.

{"text":"Friday , January 25 , 2008 .A new study by NOAA now indicates that the effects of global warming is actually resulting in fewer hurricanes in the Atlantic Basin .Warmer ocean waters are usually associated with an increase in the number of storms that develop into hurricanes and an increase in the intensity of those storms .Something that has not been discussed as much is that the same warmer waters also generates an increase in wind shear .So while the potential for a storm to increase in strength grows with warmer water temperatures , shearing winds also increase tearing those same storms apart .A warming global ocean - influencing the winds that shear off the tops of developing storms - could mean fewer Atlantic hurricanes striking the United States according to new findings by NOAA climate scientists .Furthermore , the relative warming role of the Pacific , Indian and Atlantic oceans is important for determining Atlantic hurricane activity .The article , to be published on January 23 in Geophysical Research Letters , uses observations to show that warming of global sea surface temperatures is associated with a secular , or sustained long - term increase , of vertical wind shear in the main development region for Atlantic hurricanes .The increased vertical wind shear coincides with a downward trend in U.S. landfalling hurricanes .This helps to explain why for the past two years predictions for an active tropical season have fallen short with wind shear taking the blame for the lack of storm activity .In general , we have seen consistently warm sea surface temperatures over the past several years .Yet 2006 and 2007 were rather mild while 2004 and 2005 were terrible .I think it is accurate to say that the water temperature has been consistently warm through all four summers .So why was the storm activity so different ?The increase in wind shear explains this effect and was clearly seen this past summer when storms would form and then break apart just when they should have intensified .In terms of hurricane strength , Wang notes , \" The vertical wind shear is not the only factor affecting Atlantic hurricane activity , although it is an important one .\" Other factors include atmospheric humidity , sea level pressure , and sea surface temperature .Other factors include the amount of dust in the air ( as we saw in 2006 ) influence of other low pressure systems and fronts especially as a storm approaches landfall , the multidecadal cycle and El Nino / La Nina patterns .Those who point to the warming of the oceans as evidence that global warming will result in more stronger hurricanes are over simplifying the situation .As we have seen these past two years , such a comparison is not realistic .This study shows that over a longer time period , a causal effect can be seen between wind shear and ocean temperatures .Observations from 1854 to 2006 show a warming of sea surface temperature occurring almost everywhere over the global ocean , with large warming in tropical regions of the Pacific , Atlantic , and Indian oceans .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"56.93302"}

{"text":"Some computer models also project decreases in variability .The variability depends on season and location and is also tied to surface characteristics , such as snow on the ground or moisture in the soil .In midlatitudes , changes in the daily variability of temperature have also been linked to changes in the frequency and intensity of storms and in the location of the paths commonly taken by storms .These storm tracks are , in effect , a succession of eastward - moving midlatitude .depressions whose passage dominates the weather .The relation between these storms and temperature is complex .In a warmer world , the difference of temperature between the tropics and the poles would most likely cover a smaller range , because greater warming is expected near the poles .This factor would tend to weaken storms .On the other hand , high in the atmosphere this difference would be reversed , having the opposite influence .Changes in storms could also happen if anthropogenic aerosols continue to cool the surface regionally , altering the horizontal temperature contrasts that control the location of the storm tracks .More Precipitation .The relation between storms and temperature patterns is one of the reasons it is so difficult to simulate climate changes .The major aspects of climate -- temperature , precipitation and storms -- are so interrelated that it is impossible to understand one independently of the others .In the global climate system , for example , the familiar cycle of evaporation and precipitation transfers not only water from one place to another but also heat .The heat used at the surface by evaporation of the water is released high in the atmosphere when the water condenses again into clouds and precipitation , warming the surrounding air .The atmosphere then loses this heat by radiating it out into space .With or without additional greenhouse gases , the earth takes in the same amount of solar energy and radiates the same amount back out into space .With a greater concentration of greenhouse gases , however , the surface is better insulated and can radiate less heat directly from the ground to space .The efficiency with which the planet radiates heat to space goes down , which means that the temperature must go up in order for the same amount of heat to be radiated .And as the temperature increases , more evaporation takes place , leading to more precipitation , averaged across the globe .Precipitation will not increase everywhere and throughout the year , however .( In contrast , all areas of the globe should have warmer temperatures by the end of the next century . )The distribution of precipitation is determined not only by local processes but also by the rates of evaporation and the atmospheric circulations that .transport moisture .For instance , most models predict reduced precipitation in southern Europe in summer as a result of increased greenhouse gases .A significant part of the rainfall in this region comes from local evaporation , with the water not precipitated locally being exported to other areas .Thus , in a warmer climate , increased evaporation in the spring would dry out the soil and lead to less water being available for evaporation and rainfall in the summer .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"69.35085"}

{"text":"Since the turn of the century , precipitation has indeed increased in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere , primarily during the cold season , as temperatures have increased .But for tropical and subtropical land areas , precipitation has actually decreased over the past few decades .This is especially apparent over the Sahel and eastward to Indonesia .In northernmost North America ( north of 55 degrees ) and Eurasia , where conditions are normally far below freezing for much of the year , the amount of snowfall has increased over the past several decades .Further increases in snowfall are likely in these areas .Farther south , in southern Canada and the northern U.S. , the ratio of snow to rain has decreased , but because of the increase in total precipitation there has been little overall change in the amount of snowfall .In the snow transition belts , where snow is intermittent throughout the cold season , the average snowfall will tend to diminish as the climate warms , before vanishing altogether in some places .Interestingly , areal snow cover during spring and summer abruptly diminished by nearly 10 percent after 1986 .This decrease in snow cover has contributed to the rise of spring temperatures in the middle and high latitudes .Besides the overall amounts of precipitation , scientists are particularly interested in the frequency of heavy downpours or rapid accumulations because of the major practical implications .Intense precipitation can result in flooding , soil erosion and even loss of life .What change do we expect in this frequency ?Whether precipitation occurs is largely determined by the relative humidity , which is the ratio of the concentration of water vapor to its maximum saturation value .When the relative humidity reaches 100 percent , water condenses into clouds , making precipitation possible .Computer models suggest that the distribution of relative humidity will not change much as the climate changes .The concentration of water vapor needed to reach saturation in the air rises rapidly with temperature , however , at about 6 percent per degree Celsius .So in a warmer climate , the frequency of precipitation ( which is related to how often the relative humidity reaches 100 percent ) will change less than the amount of precipitation ( related to how much water vapor there is in the air ) .In addition , not only will a warmer world be likely to have more precipitation , but the average precipitation event is likely to be heavier .Various analyses already support the notion of increased intensity .In the U.S. , for example , an average of about 10 percent of the total annual precipitation that falls does so during very heavy downpours in which at least 50 millimeters falls in a single day .This proportion was less than 8 percent at the beginning of this century .As incredible as it may seem with all this precipitation , the soil in North America , Southern Europe and in several other places is actually expected to become drier in the coming decades .Dry soil is of particular concern because of its far - reaching effects , for instance , on crop yields , groundwater resources , lake and river ecosystems and even on down to the foundations of buildings .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"83.872345"}

{"text":"Fortunately , researchers have been able to garner some insights about these extremes by analyzing decades of weather data .For statistical reasons , even slight increases in the average temperature can result in big jumps in the number of very warm days .[ see Small Shifts].One of the reasons temperature extremes are so difficult to model is that they are particularly sensitive to unusual circulation patterns and air masses , which can occasionally cause them to follow a trend in the direction opposite that of the mean temperature .For example , in the former Soviet Union , the annual extreme minimum temperature has increased by a degree and a half , whereas the annual extreme maximum showed no change .The National Climatic Data Center , which is part of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA , has developed a statistical model that simulates the daily maximum and minimum temperatures from three properties of a plot of temperature against time .These three properties are the mean , its daily variance and its day - to - day correlation ( the correlation is an indication of how temperatures persist -- for example , how often a hot day is followed by another hot day ) .Given new values of mean , variance and persistence , the model will project the duration and severity of extremes of temperature .Some of its predictions are surprising .For example , Chicago exhibits considerable variability of temperature from week to week .They might even persist for several days in a row .There should also be a significant reduction in the number of early- and late - season freezes .And , not surprisingly , during the summer , uncomfortably hot spells , including so - called killer heat waves , would become more frequent .Because of their effects on agriculture , increases in the minimum are quite significant .Observations over land areas during the latter half of this century indicate that the minimum temperature has increased at a rate more than 50 percent greater than that of the maximum .This increase has lengthened the frost - free season in many parts of the U.S. ; in the Northeast , for example , the frost - free season now begins an average of 11 days earlier than it did during the 1950s .A longer frost - free season can be beneficial for many crops grown in places where frost is not very common , but it also affects the growth and development of perennial plants and pests .The reasons minimum temperatures are going up so much more rapidly .than maximums remain somewhat elusive .One possible explanation revolves around cloud cover and evaporative cooling , which have increased in many areas .Clouds tend to keep the days cooler by reflecting sunlight and the nights warmer by inhibiting loss of heat from the surface .Greater amounts of moisture in the soil from .additional precipitation and cloudiness inhibit daytime temperature increases because part of the solar energy goes into evaporating this moisture .More conclusive answers , as well as a prediction about whether the asymmetry in daytime and nighttime warming will continue , await better computer models .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"91.429535"}

{"text":"By examining these measurements and records , climatologists are beginning to get a picture of how and where extremes of weather and climate have occurred .It is the relation between these extremes and the overall temperature increase that really interests scientists .This is where another critical research tool -- global ocean - atmosphere climate models -- comes in .These high - performance computer programs simulate the important processes of the atmosphere and oceans , giving researchers insights into the links between human activities and major weather and climate events .The combustion of fossil fuels , for example , increases the concentration in the atmosphere of certain greenhouse gases , the fundamental agents of the global warming that may be attributable to humans .These gases , which include carbon dioxide , methane , ozone , halocarbons and nitrous oxide , let in sunlight but tend to insulate the planet against the loss of heat , not unlike the glass of a greenhouse .Thus , a higher concentration means a warmer climate .Of all the human - caused ( anthropogenic ) greenhouse gases , carbon dioxide has by far the greatest impact on the global heat budget ( calculated as the amount of heat absorbed by the planet less the amount radiated back into space ) .Contributing to carbon dioxide 's greenhouse potency is its persistence : as much as 40 percent of it tends to remain in the atmosphere for centuries .Accumulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide is promoted not only by combustion but also by tropical deforestation .The second most influential human - caused effect on the earth 's radiation budget is probably that of aerosols , which are minute solid particles , sometimes covered by a liquid film , finely dispersed in the atmosphere .They , too , are produced by combustion , but they also come from natural sources , primarily volcanoes .By blocking or reflecting light , aerosols tend to mitigate global warming on regional and global scales .In contrast to carbon dioxide , aerosols have short atmospheric residence times ( less than a week ) and consequently are concentrated near their sources .At present , scientists are less certain about the radiative effects of aerosols than those of greenhouse gases .By taking increases in greenhouse gases into account , global ocean - atmosphere climate models can provide some general indications of what we might anticipate regarding changes in weather events and extremes .Unfortunately , however , the capabilities of even the fastest computers and our limited understanding of the linkages among various atmospheric , climatic , terrestrial and oceanic phenomena limit our ability to model important details on the scales at which they occur .For example , clouds are of great significance in the atmospheric heat budget , but the physical processes that form clouds and determine their characteristics operate on scales too small to be accounted for directly in global - scale simulations .How Hot , and How Often ?The deficiencies in computer models become rather apparent in efforts to reproduce or predict the frequency of climate and weather extremes of all kinds .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"99.16711"}

'It 's caused by the upcoming climate conference .This Summit will be a different kind of Climate Summit .It is aimed at catalyzing action by governments , business , finance , industry , and civil society in areas for new commitments and substantial , scalable and replicable contributions to the Summit that will help the world shift toward a low - carbon economy .They are walking a tight rope .They want to make the wild claims officially but know full well that it 's not backed by science .They make only short term claims ( weather ) , speculate about the future ( climate models ) , or longer term claims of trends ( natural ) and link it to man with weasel words .They only tell half of the truth when they tell it at all .I thought that many studies predicted that the number of hurricanes may decrease but there will be a small increase in stronger ones .They did not mention the part about fewer hurricanes in the section quoted above .Over the last 50 years [ 1964 - 2014 ] , much of the U.S. has seen increases in prolonged periods of excessively high temperatures , heavy downpours , and in some regions , severe floods and droughts .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"112.5734"}
