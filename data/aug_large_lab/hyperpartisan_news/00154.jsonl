{"text":"Additionally , electronic forums often lack supervision .In addition , when teenagers know more about computers and cellular phones than their parents or guardians , they are therefore able to operate the technologies without concern that a parent will discover their experience with bullying ( whether as a victim or offender ) .Another factor is the inseparability of a cellular phone from its owner , making that person a perpetual target for victimization .Users often need to keep their phone turned on for legitimate purposes , which provides the opportunity for those with malicious intentions to engage in persistent unwelcome behavior such as harassing telephone calls or threatening and insulting statements via the cellular phone 's text messaging capabilities .Cyberbullying thus penetrates the walls of a home , traditionally a place where victims could seek refuge from other forms of bullying .Compounding this infiltration into the home life of the cyberbully victim is the unique way in which the internet can \" create simultaneous sensations of exposure ( the whole world is watching ) and alienation ( no one understands ) .\" [ 20 ] For youth who experience shame or self - hatred , this effect is dangerous because it can lead to extreme self isolation .Moreover , bullies can gang up on their victims on electronic pages more efficiently than they do in traditional bullying , since there is no limit to the number of people who can join in , following a bullying statement .[21 ] .One possible advantage for victims of cyberbullying over traditional bullying is that they may sometimes be able to avoid it simply by avoiding the site / chat room in question .Email addresses and phone numbers can be changed ; in addition , most e - mail accounts now offer services that will automatically filter out messages from certain senders before they even reach the inbox , and phones offer similar caller ID functions .However , this does not protect against all forms of cyberbullying ; publishing of defamatory material about a person on the internet is extremely difficult to prevent and once it is posted , millions of people can potentially download it before it is removed .Some perpetrators may post victims ' photos , or victims ' edited photos like defaming captions or pasting victims ' faces on nude bodies .Examples of famous forums for disclosing personal data or photos to \" punish \" the \" enemies \" include the Hong Kong Golden Forum , Live Journal , and more recently JuicyCampus .Despite policies that describe cyberbullying as a violation of the terms of service , many social networking Web sites have been used to that end .[ 22 ] .Legislation geared at penalizing cyberbullying has been introduced in a number of U.S. states including New York , Missouri , Rhode Island and Maryland .At least seven states passed laws against digital harassment in 2007 .Dardenne Prairie of Springfield , Missouri , passed a city ordinance making online harassment a misdemeanor .The city of St. Charles , Missouri has passed a similar ordinance .Missouri is among other states where lawmakers are pursuing state legislation , with a task forces expected to have \" cyberbullying \" laws drafted and implemented .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"77.40461"}

{"text":"Cyberbullying is becoming more and more prevalent .Children , celebrities and campaigners are among those who have experienced abuse , whilst evidence suggests that it is also becoming a problem in workplaces .In the past decade communication technologies have increasingly infiltrated the workplace .For instance , UK office workers send and receive 10,000 emails per year according to researchers at Warwick Business School .Many of these will be generic work requests , a few might be impolite and some could be downright abusive .There are reasons to believe that cyberbullying behaviours perpetrated in the organisational context are more subtle than those observed among children and adolescents .This is because employees are bound by regulations that prohibit explicit abuse aimed at co - workers and adults may have developed the capacity to disguise bullying behaviours .Despite this , workplace cyberbullying can still cause harm as researchers have linked it to low job satisfaction , mental strain and intention to quit the organisation .Examples of workplace cyberbullying can include online threats , overly critical emails and the distribution of embarrassing pictures and personal information .Aspects of computer mediated communication mean that workplace cyberbullying differs from offline workplace bullying in several key ways .For instance , it is possible for perpetrators to remain anonymous , the perpetrator and victim are often in different locations when messages are distributed and cyber acts can be seen by a much larger audience .Furthermore , certain acts of cyberbullying are more permanent than the transience of offline bullying acts and they can be experience by employees outside of the work environment .Before in - depth research can address workplace cyberbullying it is critical to develop valid and reliable tools to measure it .This is the focus of a study being run by researchers at the University of Sheffield .If you are employed and would like to take part in the study please click on the link below .Researchers from the University of Sheffield are working with the support of No Bullying to identify how negative behaviours conducted through technology can impact employee health , job satisfaction and working relationships .People are increasingly using technology to communicate with their colleagues .It is therefore important to investigate how negative technology - mediated behaviours affect employees .If you are employed and would like to contribute to knowledge on cyberbullying within the context of work , we would like to invite you to take a short survey on negative technological experiences , job satisfaction , health and work engagement .To obtain data that will give a casual indication of how negative technological behaviours affect people , we need to collect data now and again in six months ' time .Therefore we would like to invite you to complete this survey now as well as a second survey that will be distributed in six months .This study has been ethically approved by the Sheffield University Management School .All responses are anonymous and strictly confidential .You are also free to withdraw from the study at any time by closing the web page .To participate in the study click on this link .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"79.07877"}

{"text":"Unfortunately , some individuals with AS are not even aware when that they are being bullied because of their social naivety and impaired social cognition .As a result , adults must be exceptionally vigilant in their observations and be willing to do additional detective work when problems occur involving the social arena .It has been my experience that sometimes well - meaning adults are often too quick to point out a social error the child with AS has made when such issues occur .This may contribute to further victimization because individuals with AS are very likely to make social blunders or errors because of the innate characteristics of their disability .Since many people who experience chronic , frequent bullying carry a lot of self - blame and shame , we must be careful not to add on any further blame and shame .We can not expect the most vulnerable , least empowered individual , the child with AS who is being bullied , to fix the problem .Another critical aspect of our adult role in bullying prevention is to address low - level bullying when it occurs in our presence or is reported to us .When low - level bullying is ignored or even encouraged , it implies acceptance and further victimizes the targeted child .It also creates a heightened sense of hopelessness and feeds the tendency of children not to go to adults for help .A few examples of low - level bullying are name - calling , other types of put - downs , nonverbal gestures and \" dirty \" looks , and intentionally leaving someone out of a group activity .These are common occurrences in the school environment and only a sampling of the types of bullying children experience .Unfortunately , research indicates that adults almost always underestimate the extent and impact of bullying compared to what students report they are experiencing .Research also indicates a \" culture of silence \" where children do not report bullying and hold low expectations for the amount of support and help adults will give them .Obviously , we need to be more diligent in our awareness of bullying and our responses when it occurs or is reported to us .An equally important adult responsibility is to make sure that we model the behaviors we require from our students or our own children .Efforts to impact the behavior and attitudes of our children will fail miserably if we as adults do not hold ourselves to the same or higher levels of respect and accountability .The use of sarcasm is a common type of adult bullying and though it may be useful in the short term at controlling behavior , it comes at the expense of humiliating and angering our youth .For children with AS who may already be experiencing bullying by their peers and have less social support , this can create even more vulnerability and may contribute to them becoming a scapegoat for an entire class or school community .Adult acceptance , support , and protection are extremely critical for any child in this situation .Having an adult take action , take a stand , or even take an interest in this child can make all the difference .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"82.85147"}
