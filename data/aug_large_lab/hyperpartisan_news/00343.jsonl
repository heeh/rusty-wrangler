{"text":"When asked about his choice of music Bossie confessed that \" There are no accidents in this film . \"So the Hitler reference was deliberate on the part of the filmmakers .Caddell 's role was to assemble a group of disenchanted Obama supporters who could be manipulated to bash the President 's reelection bid .In fact , the whole focus of the film 's message was that there are some folks who voted for Obama in 2008 who do n't plan to vote for him again .That is n't exactly an earth shattering revelation .Many people on both sides of the political spectrum change their minds .But the people featured in this film were particularly daft .They expressed their disappointment in the President because he did n't fulfill their expectations of miraculous healings and the saving of souls .In their own words they seemed to believe that Obama could achieve the impossible , and when he did n't they abandoned him .That is probably a tiny demographic in America and they are not likely to have a noticeable impact on the election .By comparison , the Obama campaign just released a video of former Republicans who will be supporting the President in November .Their stories are far more representative of typical moderates who are surprised and appalled by the extremist leanings of the modern Republican Party .Republicans just adopted a platform for the party 's convention that illustrates how far from the mainstream they have drifted .Those are real issues that will drive the voting decisions of rational moderates .The glassy - eyed sycophants plucked out of obscurity by the anti - Obama film crew will have zero effect on clear - thinking voters as they evaluate the agendas put forward by Obama and Romney .What may have an effect , however , are the millions of dollars the filmmakers have promised to spend on advertising their crocumentary .They can finance their campaign with funds acquired from the sort of Super PACs that their Supreme Court decision enabled .What 's disturbing about this is that they freely admit that their purpose is not so much to promote the film , but to let their ads serve as disguised political messages aimed at disparaging the President and affecting the outcome of the election .The reason that they chose this month to release the film was so their advertising would appear during the campaign season and they could pretend that it was merely marketing for the movie .And I repeat , this is not a conspiracy theory , it is something they specifically admit to and boast about .Of course , the filmmakers always have Fox News to fuel their hype .The GOP network is more than happy to donate as much time as necessary to promote the movie , just as they have done for prior projects .The Hannity show was just the beginning .The film will officially debut at the Republican National .Convention .Etch - a - Sketch next week , and there will surely be more segments devoted to the film on Fox News .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"83.99416"}
{"text":"Scott Conroy at RealClearPolitics was invited to review a rough cut of the film and wrote an extended analysis that described a work of blatant propaganda .The film lionizes the Mama Grizzly as a fighter against government corruption while omitting her own ethical lapses ( i.e. TrooperGate ) and pretending that embarrassing episodes , like her inability to tell Katie Couric what she reads , did n't exist .Anyone who thinks that this fluff piece will provide useful information about Palin might better spend their time watching Alice in Wonderland .Conroy offers this synopsis of Palin 's morality play : . \"Divided into three acts , the film makes the case that despite the now cliched label , Palin was indeed a maverick who confronted the powerful forces lined up against her to achieve wide - ranging success in a short period of time .The second part of the film 's message is just as clear , if more subjective : that Sarah Palin is the only conservative leader who can both build on the legacy of the Reagan Revolution and bring the ideals of the tea party movement to the Oval Office .The question I have is : at what point do Palin 's activities constitute a presumption of a candidacy for office ?Conroy notes that she has hired a chief of staff and that \" her team of advisers is operating under the notion that they are laying the groundwork for a future campaign , until they are told otherwise .\"Yet she still retains a position with Fox News .Fox previously suspended ( and later rescinded ) contracts with Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich due to their campaign activities .Mike Huckabee came under similar scrutiny but then announced that he would not run .It is time for Fox to demand that Palin declare her intentions or to remove her from her duties as a political analyst and contributor .One explanation for the inaction by Fox is that they already know her intentions and are keeping them under wraps .That , of course , would be an egregious violation of journalistic ethics .A credible news enterprise would not withhold such obviously newsworthy information .The only reason to do so would be for the political and/or financial benefit of the subject and/or netowrk , and that is not the role of the media .Just the appearance of this conflict is enough to justify that Fox insist upon Palin making an announcement , one way or the other , or cutting her loose .In closing , Conroy says that ... .That may very well be true , but it should not be .This film is just an extension of Palin 's public relations strategy .She has not had a news conference , or an interview with an impartial , non - Fox reporter , since she quit being governor .Her sole methods of communication have been through Fox News , Facebook , and Twitter .Consequently , the media should not be assisting her PR campaign by hyping her Tweets or this movie .Until she stands up before real representatives of the press , she should be ignored by the press .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"85.34257"}
