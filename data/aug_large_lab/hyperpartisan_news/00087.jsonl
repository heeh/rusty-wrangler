{"text":"And while we 're on the subject of earmarks , McCain repeated a misleading line we 've heard before .McCain : You know , we spent $ 3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana .I do n't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue , but the fact is that it was $ 3 million of our taxpayers ' money .And it has got to be brought under control .McCain 's been playing this for laughs since 2003 .The study in question was done by the U.S. Geological Survey , and it relied in part on federal appropriations .Readers ( and politicians ) may disagree on whether a noninvasive study of grizzly bear population and habitat is a waste of money .McCain clearly thinks it is - but on the other hand , he never moved to get rid of the earmark .In fact , he voted for the bill that made appropriations for the study .He did propose some changes to the bill , but none that nixed the bear funding .Iraqi Surplus Exaggerated .Obama was out of date in saying the Iraqi government has \" 79 billion dollars , \" when he argued that the U.S. should stop spending money on the war in Iraq .O bama : We are currently spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $ 79 billion surplus .As we 've said before , there was a time when the country could have had as much as $ 79 billion , but that time has passed .What the Iraqis actually \" have \" is $ 29.4 billion in the bank .The Government Accountability Office projected in August that Iraq 's 2008 budget surplus could range anywhere from $ 38.2 billion to $ 50.3 billion , depending on oil revenue , price and volume .Then , in early August , the Iraqi legislature passed a $ 21 billion supplemental spending bill , which was omitted from the GAO 's surplus tally since it was still under consideration .The supplemental will be completely funded by this year 's surplus .So the range of what the Iraqi 's could have at year 's end is actually $ 47 billion to $ 59 billion .The $ 79 billion figure is outdated and incorrect .Update , Oct. 13 :According to GAO , Iraq was unable to spend its entire budget in 2005 , 2006 and 2007 .If the Iraqi government does n't spend its entire supplemental budget this year , Iraq 's surplus could still end up at around $ 79 billion .See our post at The FactCheck Wire for more details .$ 700 billion for oil ?McCain repeated an exaggerated claim that the U.S. is sending $ 700 billion per year to hostile countries .McCain : Look , we are sending $ 700 billion a year overseas to countries that do n't like us very much .Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations .That 's not accurate .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"114.74761"}
