{"text":"If X sounds good , saying \" Hooray for X \" is a much easier way to win over an audience than \" Sure X sounds good , but let 's calm down and consider the possibility that X is in fact bad .\" It 's possible , I grant , that X 's only sound good when those X 's are good .If so , we can safely ignore Social Desirability Bias .To test this optimistic view , I propose the following thought experiment : .Imagine we do vastly more X. Could you then publicly declare , \" We 're doing too much X \" without cringing ?If government spent ten times as much on terminally ill children , would you feel comfortable announcing , \" Government is wasting money on terminally ill children \" ?If government spent ten times as much on war heroes , would you feel comfortable shouting , \" Government gives too much to war heroes \" ?Do n't want to say such things ever ever ever ?Then the policy views you and your fellow citizens cherish are probably infected by Social Desirability Bias .The same goes for the Panglossian view that \" X sounds bad \" solely because \" X is bad . \" Imagine we increased our anti - terrorism efforts ten - fold .Would that remove the stigma from saying , \" Let 's relax our anti - terrorist efforts \" ?Not bloody likely .What then is demagoguery ?Embracing Social Desirability Bias to gain power .Making a career out of praising what sounds good and attacking what sounds bad .What 's the alternative ?Conscientiously searching for and publicizing the many disconnects between what 's pleasing to the ear and what 's true .You could object that no public enemy of Social Desirability Bias could succeed in politics .While I tend to agree , that realization should terrify you .Social Desirability Bias is a severe mental shortcoming , but to succeed in politics you have to feed it rather than starve it .I know these claims sound bad .But if you reject them because they sound bad , you are only proving my point .Comments and Sharing .The only problem I see with this , is that how can someone discern what is pandering to social desirability bias and what is sound policy .For example , libertarians broadly desire greater personal freedom and property rights .If you say \" It 's time to restrict property rights and personal freedom by about 10 times \" then it seems like the same thing right ?Basic economics resolves the puzzles .It is all about opportunity cost and balancing one desirable policy against another desirable policy .Spending less on desirable X allows you to spend more on desirable Y. You do not say you should spend less on desirable X unless it is understood that that it means more for desirable Y. .Or as Bastiat might put it , demagoguery is the politics of the seen .Ignore the possibility of unintended consequences , ignore opportunity costs , ignore changes in incentives and behavior , in short ignore everything that is n't readily apparent .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"80.122086"}

{"text":"\" Right now the race among publishers is to have their product embedded in these platforms , \" says Steve Kleinedler , executive editor for the reference group at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , which publishes the American Heritage Dictionary and recently acquired Webster 's New World Dictionary .Most dictionary publishers have n't yet gone as far as Macmillan Education , which announced in November that it would no longer make print dictionaries at all .\" Exiting print is a moment of liberation , because at last our dictionaries have found their ideal medium , \" Editor in Chief Michael Rundell said when the news was announced .This month Merriam - Webster unveils a new Web site for its subscription - only unabridged dictionary , a product largely supported by universities and libraries .According to Sokolowski , this marks the first time the company has really considered its print and online products as two distinct entities .\" Some of the changes we 're making are substantial , and there are really good reasons to do it , \" he says .The company will update the online Unabridged several times a year to keep it as timely as possible .He notes that the first release of updates took place March 1 and includes about 5,000 newly defined words , 100,000 new author quotations , and 200 new paragraphs on usage , not to mention \" updates to thousands of existing entries . \"Beyond that , lexicographers have room to stretch online and add more usage guidelines and examples when they 're writing new entries .That all means the online dictionary \" will grow increasingly distinct \" from its print relative , Sokolowski explains .D espite the Macmillan editor in chief 's argument that digital is ideal for dictionaries , no medium is perfect .Print offers pleasures that pixels do n't .It 's hard to electronically recreate the joy of browsing a printed page of definitions and \" finding something you did n't know you were looking for , \" Martin says .Dictionary makers are working on electronic simulacra .If you 're using the Merriam - Webster phone app , for instance , you can turn your device horizontally and get a scrolling list of words that mimics browsing in the vicinity of a word in a print dictionary .As Martin sees it , there are compensations for what 's lost in the jump from page to screen .Online look - ups liberate dictionary users from the straitjacket of the alphabet .\" For most of its life , the dictionary has been limited by alphabetical order , \" she says .\" That was the default way to navigate through the text . \"No longer .Now that the OED has an online presence , readers can explore its accumulated linguistic riches in ways that do n't depend on A - B - C order .For example , the OED has played to its strength as a historical dictionary , which preserves the past uses and meanings of words , by integrating its historical thesaurus .That \" puts all of the enormous content of the OED into a taxonomic structure , \" Martin explains .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"90.32739"}

Minor , the \" madman \" of Winchester 's book , who worked on Merriam - Webster while he was at Yale .Series three began in 1890 and continued up to the Internet age .Since 1890 , the nameplate has said \" International , \" a change that Morse says came about as the United States became a global power , though it was a term that \" overpromised all along as the dictionary always used American English . \"The later use of \" collegiate \" in the title was aspirational too , he explains .The greatest change since the price cut came about lately : the unlimited space offered by online publication is , says Morse \" a complete gamechanger .\" The new online product , titled \" Merriam - Webster Unabridged , \" is a bigger reset , says Morse , than simply issuing a fourth edition .In 2002 , the dictionary went online , and was a straight digitization of the book .This product , which has a new look , \" shoots past \" the 100,000 illustrative quotes and example sentences used previously to provide 1,000 more in the first release alone .The vast job of revising the material is done alphabetically and by theme , so that users will initially see the most changes to entries for \" A \" words .However , changes to those words have a ripple effect , since every word used in a definition must in turn be defined in the way that it was used there .While some entries were still edited to make them more concise , the editors took advantage of the freedom offered by the new medium .Unlimited space means , for example , that it is now possible to offer more variant forms of capitalization than was possible before .The unabridged will also offer extras such as a word of the day , and lists of the words that users are looking up most frequently .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"103.864334"}
