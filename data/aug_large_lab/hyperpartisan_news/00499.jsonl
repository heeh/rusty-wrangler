{"text":"That is because the history books are usually written by the winners of a war and this war was won by the Union .However , after following my family around since I was just a year old to Civil War Living History scenarios in Gettysburg and elsewhere , I have listened to both sides of the story , from those portraying historical figures , both Union and Confederate .It was more about preserving the United States and protecting the rights of the individual , the very tenets upon which this country was founded .I personally think that the people who profess that the Civil War was only fought about slavery have not read their history books .I really am glad that slavery was abolished , but I do n't think it should be glorified as being the sole reason the Civil War was fought .There are so many more issues that people were intensely passionate about at the time .Slavery was one of them , but it was not the primary cause of the war .The primary causes of the war were economics and states ' rights .Slavery was a part of those greater issues , but it was not the reason the Southern States seceded from the Union , nor fought the Civil War .It certainly was a Southern institution that was part of the economic system of the plantations , and because of that , it was part and parcel of the economic reasons that the South formed the Confederacy .The economic issue was one of taxation and being able to sell cotton and other raw materials where the producers wanted to , rather than where they were forced to , and at under inflated prices .Funny , it sounds very much like the reason we broke from Great Britain to begin with .The South was within their rights , but there should have been another way to solve the problem .If they had been willing to listen to Abraham Lincoln , perhaps the war could have been avoided .Lincoln had a plan to gradually free the slaves without it further hurting the plantation owners .He also had a plan to allow them to sell their products anywhere they wanted to and at a fair price .They did not choose to listen to the President , however , so they formed the Confederacy and the Civil War began .Advertisement .Follow us on Facebook .Archives .Have Confederate Symbols Lost Their Political and Racial Meanings ?Earlier today I was contacted by a student in Italy , who is currently writing on the subject of Confederate symbols in popular culture .The student inquired into a few areas and I thought he might benefit from hearing from the rest of you until I have a chance to respond .My name is - - and I 'm currently a senior student in History at the University of RomaTre in Rome , Italy .Two years ago i earned a bachelor degree in modern history and now I 'm preparing my final master thesis in North American History .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"54.774597"}

{"text":"That is an issue in itself I believe worth exploring .Why is that ?I like this piece a lot , but I also think one reason national political candidates ( Palin aside ) pander to the rural is because they almost always come from urban areas .It 's assumed that they DO understand Chicago and New York , so they strain to show they ALSO understand other places and experiences .This article reminds me of an article I read that was a post - mortem of the 2004 election called \" the Urban Archipelago , Its the Cities Stupid .\" Basically , it argued the Democrats should focus on urban areas and forget rural issues and voters .The photo op of a political candidate in a small town , eating at a local restaurant , engaging rural America certainly embraces that sense of Americana that older Americans recall fondly and may still be nostalgic for in the deep recesses of their brains .I more or less agree with the notion that I think is being expressed here -- that political culture is responsible for or complicit in constructing an imaginary landscape -- \" landscapes of nostalgia \" -- which then become the terrain on which the political campaign is acted out .The question implied here though , by the two possiblities of responsiblity and complicity , is interesting .Surely this insight is n't one that has eluded the politicians -- surely they are aware that they are playing a game , campaigning in an imagined terrain .So there are two possibilites : either voters are being willfully deceived about the nature of modern america or they are willfully complicit in sustaining an illusion - because they WANT to participate in that illusion , or because something about that illusion is attractive to them .That is , the nostalgia is not just for another place , but for another time .And though that place and time may never have existed as we might imagine or will it to , it still has an extremely powerful hold on us .A recent article by Rod Dreher gets at this while talking about Mad Men : . \" In his 1995 book The Lost City , about Chicago in the 1950s , Alan Ehrenhalt warned against the way nostalgia and poetic memory tempts contemporaries to falsely idealize the past .Though Ehrenhalt chastised liberals who demonize the world of the Fifties as nothing but a nightmarish corseted burlesque of Joe McCarthy , Jim Crow , and Cardinal Spellman , he rapped conservatives for idealizing it as the last good decade before the Sixties ruined everything .We do n't want the 1950s back , \" Ehrenhalt wrote .What we want is to edit them .We want to keep the safe streets , the friendly grocers , and the milk and cookies , while blotting out the political bosses , the tyrannical headmasters , the inflexible rules , and the lectures on 100 percent Americanism .But there is no easy way to have an orderly world without somebody making the rules by which order is preserved .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"60.632317"}

{"text":"And we are also told that the American flag has more blood on it than the Confederate flag does , so if the Confederate flag should come down , then so should the American flag .That falls flat under any inspection because the American flag was never called the \" white man 's flag \" by Betsy Ross .Then there are those who will say that if the Confederate flag represents treason , then so does the American flag .The problem with that is that not only did the United States win , albeit with some help from other countries like France , the Revolutionary War , but how many government buildings in England have the American flag flying ?When faced with insurmountable counters to these deflections , the flag lovers will pull more strawman 's out the air .None of it works .The flag is racist .Period .The flag lovers make sure that it is known what Abraham Lincoln said at the 1858 debates .It is true that in 1858 , Abraham Lincoln had a debate with Stephen A Douglas .Lincoln , who did n't want slavery to expand into the territories , was accused by Douglas 's camp of being in favor of civil rights for blacks , since he was n't in favor of the south expanding slavery into the new territories .Lincoln pushed back and said that just because he was against slavery 's expansion does n't mean that he 's in favor of civil rights .This is one of the flag lovers ' favorite deflections , and their supposed \" proof \" that the flag is NOT racist .YAY ! ! !Some of them also like to bring up that Abraham Lincoln said it would be a good idea if blacks left the United States .They ignore that over the course of the war that Lincoln stopped mentioning repatriation in addition to softening his views on race .It should be reminded that the same can not be said for the leaders of the Confederacy .There literally is nothing anyone can come up with to absolve or pass blame on either the Confederacy or the battle flag .Nothing .Every deflection that flag defenders can come up with can be countered all so easily . , and a Confederate chaplain by the name of Abram Joseph Ryan had a poem titled \" The Conquered Banner \" in which he told southerners that the flag should be furled .For a long time , the battle flag as well as other Confederate flags had largely faded into obscurity .Equally shocking is the reason why this particular flag became so popular , around eighty years , after the Civil War .It turns out that that the Confederate battle flag only became prominent around eighty years after the end of the Civil War , and the reason why had nothing to do with \" heritage \" and a lot to do with \" hate \" .Led by Strom Thurmond , the Dixiecrats resurrected the battle flag and used it as rallying symbol to oppose Civil Rights for blacks .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.11757"}

{"text":"I think that you brought up a very interesting point when it comes to what issue is worse , climate change or poverty .I asked myself the same question , \" is climate change the most important issue to each of us ? \"Though I understand where you are coming from , that changing our ways in order to fix the climate change would have a ripple effect , that would eventually continue to help those at the poverty level .I would have to state that I believe that poverty would be the most important issue to me .What happens when / if the climate change issue is fixed ?Unfortunately those people are not going to become better off solely because of natural resources .The world today is not that easy .I feel like those people need just as much help , maybe more so than the climate change issue .In my mind because they are people their issue is more direct making it more important to me personally , where as the climate change issue could be seen as more indirect issue .I think that the question about climate change and poverty is a very important one .Climate change affects all people , and has a significant impact on people who live in poverty .It is important to want everyone to take actions to help decrease climate change by decreasing carbon emissions , as well as other behavioral changes .However , when a family is barely able to put food on the table , is it fair to ask them to try to reduce climate change ?Is it fair to ask a family barely getting by to take on more responsibility ?This raises the issue of whether sustainability is something that all people should be required to do , or is a luxury for the fortunate rich countries .I think your point that climate change is not just an environmental issue , it is a human rights issue , is extremely important .Unfortunately it is easy for many people to get lost in the trivial problems of our everyday , privileged lives , and forget about larger , global issues .Many of us have not witnessed firsthand communities suffering from poverty as extreme as this , and I think its important to educate people about what is going on in different parts of the world , and how climate change can really be devastating .Dealing with climate change is an ethical issue , because our actions are contributing to it and may affect other people far worse than ourselves .I think your discussion shows that climate change and its effects need to be mitigated with a multifaceted approach , at both international and local levels .From personal experience as well , I agree that it is challenging to see poverty - stricken communities without feeling guilty about our own lifestyles .Rightfully so , it forces us to contemplate our everyday decisions , as well as what we can do to help .Unfortunately , there is not just one thing we can do to help - there are MANY \" things \" that MANY people need to do .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.820854"}

{"text":"As the sun slowly worked its way across the sky , scattering golden rays of light through the ancient pines of Augusta National , I became obsessed - hooked on the game of golf , fascinated by the magic of the Masters and simply mesmerized by the aura of Tiger Woods .In the course of watching Woods ' epic duel with Chris DiMarco on the back nine , I 'm not sure exactly why I became such a diehard Tiger fan .Maybe I knew he was arguably the best athlete in the world and I just jumped on the bandwagon .Or , perhaps , I gravitated towards Woods because he was the golfer out there who looked the most like me .At any rate , I remember pressing my face against the TV when Tiger 's chip shot on the par-3 16th teased the edge of the cup before letting out a scream that might have been heard a hundred miles away in Augusta .As he has done so many times , Tiger turned a game of knocking a ball in a hole on really short grass into a mystical experience .Those moments , though , have been few and far between in recent years .It 's still hard for me to believe that Woods has not won a green jacket since that day in 2005 .Thanks to Tiger , I 'm starting to feel old at the age of 20 .Now , with his invincibility shattered and his inability to knock down a six - foot putt when it matters most - the trademark of vintage Tiger - Woods stands in a position unthinkable a decade ago : set to go down as not even the greatest player in his sport .But it 's not too late .As Nicklaus demonstrated at the 1998 Masters and Tom Watson showed at the 2009 Open Championship , golfers in their late fifties can still play at the highest level .Tiger still has every opportunity to right the ship and hit that magic number of 19 ; with that being said , the pressure will continue to mount the longer Woods continues his major drought - currently at four years .As a result , it 's absolutely crucial for him to close out the competition at a major once again sooner rather than later .And 2014 will be the perfect year to do it .In my opinion , the most telling insight into Tiger 's success - one that 's gone largely ignored by many golf analysts - is the fact that he dominates courses he likes and rarely wins on tracks that do n't quite fit his eye .His 79 PGA tour victories have come at only 25 different locations .That 's why 2014 is so important .All four of this year 's major venues are courses at which Tiger has found success in the past .Even in his so called \" down years \" in the aftermath of his scandal , Woods has pulled out top-10 finishes at the Masters in 2010 , 2011 and 2013 .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"99.06641"}

{"text":"No matter the state of his game entering April , he always seems to find the magic at Amen Corner .The U.S. Open this year returns to Pinehurst No . 2 in North Carolina , where Woods finished third to Payne Stewart in 1999 and second to Michael Campbell in 2005 .Of the four major venues in 2014 , Pinehurst is the only course where he 's failed to win , but he 's come excruciatingly close in the past .Across the pond , the Open Championship returns to Royal Liverpool , one of the two venues where Tiger has previously hoisted the Claret Jug .His emotional 2006 victory on the course was his first major win following the death of his father .Finally , the major season ends with a return to Valhalla in Louisville , Ky. where Tiger famously defeated Bob May in a playoff in 2000 after forcing a playoff on the 72nd hole .The win was Tiger 's third straight major victory in 2000 and showcased Woods at the height of his power .It 's also worth noting that Tiger is now 38-the same age Nicklaus was when he earned that 15th major .If Tiger hopes to at least keep pace with the Golden Bear , then 2014 must be the year to turn things around .Will Tiger use any of these familiar courses to get back on track in his quest to catch Jack ?That remains to be seen .He could easily go another year without getting that elusive 15th major .Alternatively , he could find his form and run the table , win on four courses he loves and take his place amongst the gods with major number 18 at Valhalla .A die - hard Tiger fan such as myself can only dream .To this day , Vihan Lakshman still smears chocolate ice cream all over his face whenever he watches the gentleman 's game .Tell him how to correctly eat ice cream and suggest some better Ben & Jerry 's flavors that he can spread on his mug at vihan ' at ' stanford.edu .About Vihan Lakshman .Vihan Lakshman is a desk editor and columnist for the Opinions Section .He also contributes to the Daily 's coverage of Stanford football and baseball and has served as a broadcaster for women 's soccer , men 's basketball and baseball on KZSU .Vihan is a sophomore from Savannah , Ga.( currently undeclared ) .In his free time , he loves reading and playing just about any sport .To contact him , please email vihan@stanford.edu .All Sports Categories .The Math Corner .Quote It .\" I never planned on really sticking around [ elite gymnastics ] because I had already accomplished everything that I wanted to do .When I was younger , where I 'd see myself when I was 19 years old is exactly where I am right now : at college pursuing engineering as a gymnast . \" -Women 's gymnast Elizabeth Price Tikkun Olam .We know you want to change the world .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"106.447876"}
{"text":"Confused , I asked the RA what the deal was .He told me the guy did n't want to room with me because he felt uncomfortable .WTF ?The guy did n't know anything about me .Then I noticed on the bookshelf was my copy of Mein Kampf .Oops ...Good news was I got a double room all to myself that semester .Bad news was everybody in the building thought I was a nazi .The next semester I got a Mormon roommate .He did n't seem to mind that I had a book by Hitler .Its an important historical document .imo , it would be a better world if more people would sit down and actually read ( in no particular order ) mein kampf , the communist manifesto , the bible , the koran , the bhagavad gita etc .These are documents which capture movements and systems of thought that have altered the course of human history .In my experience , the majority think of it as the latter .A very large portion of people at my high school had confederate flag clothing , decals , etc . , and most of these people really had no idea of why the flag originated .They just saw it as \" Southern pride \" .Not as in \" the South is gon na rise again ! \" Southern pride , but kind of like someone rooting for a sports team .I still think it can be offensive , but I suppose that it is better than living in an area where almost everyone is blatantly racist .Agreed .I had the pleasure of drinking with a confederate flag toting kid from Maine .He was the perfect living example of Almost Politically Correct Redneck .He embraced everything about being a redneck , but was all for \" the gays getting married \" and I do not believe he was the slightest bit racist from our conversations .Southern Maine is a pretty liberal place though , so I did n't think he was a good representation of confed flag toters .They seceded from those haughty Massholes in 1822 .Oh sure , it was part of the Missouri Compromise -- but it still helped .They almost decided to leave the Eastern Time Zone and join Atlantic Standard Time .That is dedication .The more urbane Downeasters wind up in New Hampshire .Are you seeing the pattern ?The Mainer is a well - read , entertaining soul with pride in place but mostly a fear that those tourists from Boston wo n't go home soon enough .Maine is accidentally not part of New Brunswick .Have you seen Trailer Park Boys ?Okay , now put a lot more space between the trailers .More trees .Yeah , you 're seeing it .Now , I 'm not saying \" get off my lawn ' , as a Mainer is raised to be cordial .I 'm merely suggesting you have a long drive home ahead of ya and traffic on 95 is always rough this time of year .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"110.41207"}
