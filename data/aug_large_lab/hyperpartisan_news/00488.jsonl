'And I do n't control the weather . \" Kroft interviewed the president twice last week , first after a speech in Osawatomie , Kan. , that was viewed as laying the groundwork for his reelection campaign .Obama spoke about the growing income inequality in America , and called it a \" make - or - break moment \" for the middle class .Kroft noted the criticism that Obama is engaging in class warfare and calling for a \" redistribution of wealth . \"\" No , we 're being honest about what happened , and we 've got to be honest about how we move forward . \"A CBS / New York Times poll released this weekend found that 54 % of Americans think Obama does n't deserve another term .Kroft asked Obama to make his case .He rattled off a familiar list of accomplishments , starting with \" saving this country from a Great Depression \" and rescuing the auto industry .There 's also healthcare reform , financial reforms , ending \" do n't ask , do n't tell \" and \" decimating \" Al Qaeda , including the death of Osama bin Laden .\" But you know , but when it comes to the economy , we 've got a lot more work to do .And we 're , we 're going to keep on at it . \" The president also quoted his vice president in describing why he 's not worried about poll numbers at this point .\" I 'm being judged against the ideal .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"42.936718"}
{"text":"The resolution also establishes what President Obama has been emphasizing for many months : that the use of chemical weapons anywhere constitutes a threat to international peace and security .By establishing this , the Security Council is establishing a new international norm .The deal was cinched following Kerry 's meeting today with Lavrov .US officials lauded the agreement as a landmark pact that strengthened the international effort to halt the use of chemical weapons .Kerry voiced hope that \" this resolution can now give life hopefully to the removal and destruction of chemical weapons in Syria .\" If Syria complies , the arrangement would mark a major diplomatic achievement for President Obama and for Kerry .But if Syria cheats , the president will find himself constrained from acting .Under the terms of the resolution , a committee of diplomats and functionaries from the United Nations and the Organization on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will determine whether Syria has violated the terms of the agreement .The matter would then be taken up by the U.N. Security Council .In principle , Russia has agreed that in the event of a Syrian violation it is prepared to impose measures under Chapter Seven of the U.N. Charter -- a provision that is used to authorize sanctions or the use of military force .But it does n't have to .A provision of a confidential draft resolution proposed last week by Russia suggests how difficult it may be to convince Russia to press ahead with any stern measures .First , Russia insisted that evidence of a violation be \" indisputable and proved \" and that it must be of a particular \" gravity \" to merit the adoption of a new resolution .Robert Danin , a former US state department advise and now at the Council on Foreign Relations , tweets : .UN calls for end to border restrictions .Tens of thousands of people trying to flee the violence in Syria are being denied their right to seek asylum abroad by illegal border restrictions imposed by neighbouring countries , according to a UN report .It says there are \" increasing concerns \" that border restrictions are preventing IDPs fleeing Syria and forcing them into makeshift camps on the Syrian side of the border .More than 2.1 million people have fled Syria since the conflict began , according to UN figures , but Beyani 's reports says tens of thousand more would - be refugees are being prevented from leaving .Beyani accused neighbouring countries of breaching the international principle of non - refoulement which is designed to guarantee a safe haven for the victims of persecution .Launching his report Beyani said : \" I am concerned about restrictions on entry imposed by neighbouring countries on people fleeing Syria .IDPs have the right to seek asylum in other countries , and I appeal to these countries to continue to respect the institution of asylum and apply the principle of non - refoulement without any discrimination \" .Since then frustration has grown over continuing reports of border restrictions and the danger they pose to internally displaced people .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"43.066635"}

Bush , rarely ranked as an ardent friend of the news media , had 354 of them during his first term .Obama , who famously promised that his would be the most transparent administration ever : 107 .The Obama administration is deep - freezing the news media because it can .It 's nothing new for administrations to try to control the narrative .But Obama is the first president to serve in the Age of Twitter .With extensive use of its Whitehouse.gov website and its fluency on social media , the administration can get its message out on its own terms , bypassing the middlemen and women .Obama and his acolytes have made manifestly clear their disdain for the media 's focus on the trivial , on the latest flap or the gaffe du jour , at the expense of shedding light on serious issues .In fairness , they may be onto something .But that 's no excuse for cutting off the conversation .Obama , according to Kumar 's stats , also held fewer press conferences in his first term than his three immediate predecessors , although he held more solo press conferences than George W. Bush .Obama has trounced them when it comes to granting interviews .However , he has done it in a way that reflects his determination to do it his way .While ignoring outlets such as The New York Times and The Washington Post whose correspondents are well - versed in national and international issues , Obama often has turned to regional reporters and TV celebrities who are less likely to challenge him .His go - to interviewer has been Steve Kroft of CBS ' 60 Minutes .Despite the program 's hard - hitting reputation , Kroft 's questions in his last interview were so lame that characterizing them as \" softball \" would be an unfair slur to the sport .Why is any of this a big deal ?Is n't this just inside baseball about a bunch of whiny journalists unhappy that they are n't getting their way ?Not at all .The American people have a right to know what their president is thinking about important issues of the day .They should n't have to wait weeks and weeks for a formal press conference to find out .They should n't have to settle for propaganda from the White House 's Obama image - enhancement shop .In some ways , the interaction between the Obama administration and the press \" is a pretty traditional adversarial relationship , \" says New York Times White House correspondent Peter Baker .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"59.798004"}
