{"text":"It 's better to pace it , choosing a natural and steady progression , rather than rush into a confidence battering defeat that could be avoided had you simply waited until your development was at a greater stage .World welterweight champion , Saul \" Canelo \" Alvarez , 25 , has agreed to fight challenger , Amir Khan , 29 , in a boxing bout scheduled for May 7 , 2016 in Las Vegas , Nevada .The catch weight is 155 pounds .Canelo is an elite fighter , who is very tricky in the ring ( not in a bad way ) .He has used this cunning to defeat many .Canelo 's record stands at 48 - 1 .The only person who has beaten Canelo is Floyd Mayweather and on points .Canelo is a tough competitor .In light of these facts , boxing professionals and many on social networking have collectively expressed their concern regarding Khan taking such a massive step up from lightweight to welterweight , against a boxer who has fought as a welterweight , light middleweight and middleweight .Khan 's record is 34 - 3 , which is good .However , he is sometimes teased online for having a \" glass chin \" due to notable knockouts .His last few fights have gone in his favor .Many , included Mayweather , have been encouraging Khan to fight fellow Briton , Kell Brook , who is the IBF champion .However , Khan wanted a 80 - 20 split , despite the fact Brook is the champion .Khan 's demand was understandably rejected and destroyed negotiations .Brook stated to Boxing News Online , \" It seemed closer than ever .The lawyers were involved this time and it 's the most communication we 've had .But I do n't know what he was playing at , they are forgetting that I 'm the champion and he 'd be a voluntary challenger .Do n't try to price yourself out of the fight by demanding an 80 - 20 split because that 's not going to happen . \" Losing to Canelo would be less damaging than losing to Brook .Canelo has reached an elite level of boxing , making his fight the bigger international draw .Brook is less famous , but still successful and known in his own right .Losing to Brook would damage Khan 's prospects far more than losing to Canelo , who is further along in his career and development than both Khan and Brook .Canelo has far more fights and wins .Brook needs to chase big fights of his own and not wait around for Khan to sign the contract to fight him .It would be a great fight and one British fans would appreciate on home soil .However , Khan needs to raise his profile and continue to develop his skill .In all the time Khan has repeatedly refused to fight him Brook continued to progress .Take a page out of Khan 's book and go after the big dogs as well .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"108.34976"}
{"text":"Our destination aboard the president 's yacht last week was Angel Island , the largest island in San Francisco Bay .It was a day fit for a chief of state .The water was smooth , the sun strong , fanned by a welcome sea breeze .Angel Island figures prominently in the history of California .For thirty years - from 1910 to 1940 - Angel was the major entry point for perhaps 100,000 Asians and others from Pacific lands .Some refer to it as the West Coast 's Ellis Island .But that 's a wild stretch .Ellis Island in New York Bay , was the principal immigration center in the U.S. from 1892 to 1943 .Its history is gilded as a haven for 17 million , mostly European immigrants .Angel Island 's story is not so pretty .Many of the immigrants - mostly Chinese - were not welcome .Exclusion laws kept them and other Asians penned up in overcrowded and filthy barracks until their cases were decided .Most gained entry into the U.S. but others were turned away and sent back to the poverty and disorder from which they 'd fled .Some of the immigrants held captive put their rage in words carved on the barrack walls .One translated \" poem \" says , in part : . \" Detained in this wooden house for .several tens of days .because of the exclusion laws .It 's a pity heroes have no place .To exercise their prowess .Angel Island was also where detained civilians were held during World War I and World War II .It was also where prisoners of war were confined in World War II .During the Cold War , the island was the site of a Nike missile base .But today its 740 acres are a beautiful state park .I must add the views on the trip over and on the return aboard the Potomac - seascapes of San Francisco and the Marin hills are astonishing .The same goes for the sail under the new Bay Bridge under construction .Who needs a cruise to the Riviera when you have it as good in your own backyard ?This column originally appeare on October 6 , 2011 .Mel Lavine was a television producer for many years with NBC News and CBS News in New York .Contact him at his e - mail address : This e - mail address is being protected from spambots .You need JavaScript enabled to view it .I saw an item in the paper the other day .It referred to a new book by a college professor , \" Waste and Want : a Social History of Trash .One person 's trash is another person 's treasure is one way to sum up the theme .Well , anyone whose ever had a yard sale or patronized flea markets knows that ; knows that however humble and useless and trash - worthy something might be , there is always someone out there who will want it and pay money to have it .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"111.88309"}
{"text":"But , is that really true ?That 400,000 figure should be taken with a grain of salt .If the numbers are correct , it means that ANTI is already the biggest success of the singer 's storied career , and that 's a bit tough to believe .To put that 400,000 figure into perspective , it 's worth noting that Rihanna 's largest debut sales week to date was with her last album , Unapologetic .That record became her first to start at number one ( and her only number one yet ) , and it sold just under 250,000 copies in its first week .That campaign was going strong at the time of the album 's release thanks to the massively - popular lead single \" Diamonds \" , which was another number one hit for her .So , without a single ( lead cut \" Work \" was released less than a day before the album appeared online ) and little to no warning , is it really possible that the record is approaching half a million in sales in just two days ?If so , that puts ANTI on track to have a massive first week , dwarfed only in recent memory by Adele or Taylor Swift .Interestingly , while the RIAA does count those one million copies as sales , neither Billboard nor Nielsen ( which provides Billboard with data every week ) will recognize them .A full length needs to be sold for at least a certain price ( $ 3.49 ) within the first month it comes out in order to be included in the weekly ranking .The price that Samsung paid for those one million albums that it gave away ca n't be deciphered , so they wo n't be included in her official first week tally .Both Tidal and Rihanna would benefit from these huge numbers - numbers that are only expected to grow .The rollout of ANTI did n't go as planned for the streaming service , so it could use some good press .The story is so great it 's almost unbelievable ... and that 's the problem .This is n't to say that the figures are incorrect , but do keep in mind where they are coming from .Share .Twitter Updates .Twitter Updates .Translate .Blog Archive .January 28 , 2016 .Like all members of Congress , U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz must stand for re - election in November .Unusually , for a six - term incumbent , she 's facing a challenger in the Democratic primary .But that 's not the election fight Wasserman Schultz is most engaged in now .Instead , she 's become a target in the intensifying battle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to become the Democratic party 's presidential nominee .Sanders supporters across the country accuse the South Florida lawmaker of using her powerful post as chair of the Democratic National Committee to tip the scales toward Clinton .It 's a dispute for which there is no definitive evidence .Even some of Sanders ' most fervent partisans do n't believe it .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"119.62953"}
