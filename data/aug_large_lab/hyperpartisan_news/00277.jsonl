{"text":"I am not as educated in Philsophy as some of your readers , but I would like to generalise that statement .To my opinion , liberalism is not only about avoiding pain but about avoiding life in general .For example , the First Law of Liberalism ( after L. Auster ) can be explained on this basis .Because the worse some alien group behaves , the more it makes our life intolerable , hence the more reasons are to avoid life .Any real attempt to improve the situation , to bring life and reason to the world , is therefore undermining liberalism .Actually , we are living in the environment which is in many details hostile to life , though physically comfortable .LA replies : .The other day I came upon an old VFR discussion , I do n't remember which one , where someone said that liberalism is not about life , liberalism is about the self .Charles T. writes : .The description of gentile Christians having only a \" universal or sacrificial ethos \" describes a great majority of my Christian friends .But it does not have to be that way .It is this way because most Christians I know concentrate only on 1 ) salvation - for themselves and others ; and 2 ) the next life to come .If America 's Christians would read and study the OT as well as the New , I think they would see that The Lord is just as concerned for the state of affairs in this world as the next .Example : The Law of Moses is deeply concerned about how we treat our neighbors .Unfortunately , CS 's observation about many Christians is correct .From the comments : A reductivist versus commonsense reading of scripture .Excellent .This is the best summation of why the evangelical church is making so many mistakes in their reading and teaching of scripture .In fact , such reductivism leads many to neglect personal safety and to jettison their God - given personal instincts for survival in order to prove their love for other people thus fulfilling the teachings of their evangelical pastors and ministers .Very sad .Rather than being thinking , discerning Christians , the evangelical movement has reduced their people to trained seals jumping through hoops to satisfy the ridiculous demands of their career minded ministers .Hannon writes : .Why should modern Christianity take in certain cultural or political principles of the current permutation of the \" host \" foundation ?Perhaps it is , rather than anything new or unprecedented , more a natural adaptation to yet another seemingly inexorable tide of social change .This time it is modern liberalism , against which any resistant group or idea is ( quite successfully ) painted as anachronistic and threatening .Christianity may be the ultimate ideal of such resistance , at least in theory .But as secularism more loudly condemns its most intractable antagonists , churches have been increasingly vocal about their support for certain items on the leftist social agenda .The liberal tempo of modern society in the West is mirrored in the behavior of its waning churches and this is wrong .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"50.441906"}

{"text":"African expressions of Christianity have emerged to challenge the Western model which much nineteenth and twentieth century mission brought with it .Evangelicals are often cautious about contextualisation and contextual expressions of theology .This is partly because these have often emerged from liberal churches which place less emphasis on the authority of Scripture , and which are more willing to adopt local resources from a culture 's pre - Christian or non - Christian tradition .It is , however , partly because Western evangelicals are also culturally blinkered .We assume that our own expressions of Christian faith and practice are somehow \" pure \" and untainted by our culture , but , as Bosch and others have demonstrated , Western evangelicalism is strongly influenced by modernity and the Enlightenment .Increasingly , evangelicals involved in mission both as missiologists and as practitioners have embraced the concept of contextualisation , seeing it as vital to enable Christianity to be expressed in culturally appropriate forms , and to be freed from its image as a western religion .Increasing numbers of attacks on Christians by militant Islamic groups in places such as Pakistan , Indonesia and Nigeria , highlights the importance of this .Contextualisation must not be seen simply as a tool to make mission more effective .Truly authentic contextualisation will occur naturally as the Gospel takes root and bears fruit spontaneously within particular cultures .The particular challenge for evangelicals is to let Scripture remain authoritative within any culture , but to realise that all interpretations of the Scripture are affected by cultural presuppositions .Developing good skills in hermeneutics thus is vital .The question of the relationship between the verbal proclamation of the Gospel and its demonstration was ( and in some cases still is ) a particularly thorny one for evangelicals throughout most of the twentieth century .The emergence of the Social Gospel movement which reinterpreted salvation in humanistic rather than eschatological terms caused evangelicals to retreat from their commitment to social action which had characterised them in the nineteenth century .Within the ecumenical movement the goal of mission came to be seen almost exclusively in this - worldly terms .It is a slight caricature , but Western evangelicals tended to be very suspicious of any activity which smacked too much of social or political involvement , except for activities such as medical mission .Even these were mainly of value in creating responsiveness in people for the message of spiritual salvation .It was the Lausanne Congress of 1974 which marked a turning point in evangelical thinking in this area .The contribution in particular of Latin American evangelical leaders such as Rene Padilla , Samuel Escobar and the late Orlando Costas awakened this gathering of evangelical leaders to the challenge of poverty and injustice , and the fact that authentic mission had to respond to these questions .Many Western evangelicals still feel a certain degree of tension between the need to preach \" spiritual \" salvation and work for earthly justice , and there is need for continued reflection on Biblical and theological themes relating to these questions .The Biblical theme which is of most help here is Jesus ' teaching on the kingdom .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"59.575542"}

{"text":"The social gospel became the hallmark of the liberal church , as pointed out above , because the liberals had emptied their message and ministry of biblical truth and were left with no other \" good news \" than solving physical problems .Sadly , evangelicals today are increasingly adopting the missional , social gospel of liberalism .However , it would be unfair to say that this is yet a majority opinion or action among true evangelicals .Rather , the more common approach is to espouse a two - tiered gospel which is composed of the biblical gospel of redemption and the social gospel of world betterment .While this is an upgrade from the purely missional model of liberalism it nevertheless lacks biblical warrant and endangers the true gospel of salvation .Let 's take a look .John R.

{"text":"This is not merely a theoretical discussion , but one which will significantly affect the practice of mission .If western missionaries still approach mission from the perspective that their way of doing things is the right way or the best way they risk being guilty of a kind of ecclesiastical colonialism .The concept of missio dei , the mission of God , is one of the key concepts in contemporary missiology .It signifies a shift away from seeing mission as something , which the church does , to seeing mission as something which God does , indeed as something which God , by his nature , is .Just as the Father sends the Son , and as Father and Son together send the Spirit , so Father , Son and Spirit send the church into the world , as an instrument of God 's sending and saving love .This results in seeing mission as more than just making converts and planting churches , but rather as an expression of God 's love and purpose for the world .There is a lot of strength in this concept , but it presents difficulties for evangelicals in the way that more radical theologians and practitioners have interpreted it .They interpret the mission of God as being anything which leads towards human liberation .So , for example , the activities of Marxist guerrilla movements or , more contemporaneously , ecological activists , even if they have no explicit Christian connection , may be identified as working within the mission of God , since they reflect God 's purposes for the world .This view was strongly represented in WCC circles between the 1960s and 1980s , where \" humanisation \" rather than \" salvation \" was emphasised , and it still has influence today .The evangelical missiologist Chris Wright , in his magisterial work The Bible and the Mission of God , shows how this understanding of mission is thoroughly grounded in a reading of the whole of Scripture .The issue of how Christians involved in mission relate to those of other faith traditions is becoming increasingly important .The twentieth century saw the growth of Christianity to become a truly global religion , but it did not see a corresponding decline in the other so - called \" high \" religions of Judaism Islam , Hinduism and Buddhism .Most growth occurred as people moved from primal religions to Christianity .If anything , there has been a resurgence in these other non - Christian religions as well .This has led to a questioning among some Christians , both about the status of those who either do not hear or who do not respond to the Gospel of Christ , and to the question of how those of other faiths should be approached .Traditional evangelical thinking viewed everyone who did not respond positively to the claims of Christ as eternally lost , and tended to understand the other religious traditions as being either the products of human ignorance or of demonic deception .Some Roman Catholic theologians have suggested approaches which retain the supremacy of Christ but which see Christ as the fulfilment of other religions .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.189285"}

Michael Craven .The latter half of the 20th century has seen the emergence of two extremes in the American Church and its relationship to the culture - liberal revisionism on the one side and conservative fundamentalism on the other .Both , I contend , have hindered the work and ministry of the Church .One renders the Christian faith meaningless while the other makes it irrelevant .Liberal revisionism has capitulated to contemporary culture and with it many truths of the historic faith .Liberal revisionism ultimately renders the Christian message meaningless by reducing Christ to anything you want him to be - there is simply no authority in this view beyond your own preference and cultural whims .My concern herein however is not for liberal revisionism but conservative fundamentalism , which has become the predominant view .Additionally , unlike liberal revisionism , conservative fundamentalism remains Christian but a distorted version of it that is often difficult to distinguish .A recent conversation with Os Guinness offers this further insight : .I think Os puts this well when he describes fundamentalism as \" an overlay \" which , as a result , has captured the thinking of many unwitting Christians .This is frequently expressed in terms of conservative politics , Christian nationalism and what one Evangelical writer revealed when he referred to the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount as \" Americanisms . \"Being Christian and being American are often thought to be synonymous .Practically , these expressions are manifest in the almost exclusive reliance upon coercion and politics as the means and method of bringing culture under the influence of biblical principles .The idea is that if \" we \" can only capture political control we can bring about cultural change in a way that recovers biblical values .Cal Thomas refers to this as expecting the \" Kingdom of God to arrive on Air Force One .\" There is no doubt that secularism has achieved its pinnacle in our time , however this does not mean that Christianity was the singular prevailing reality that occupied its place prior to this point .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.65345"}

Wright and the \" missional \" understanding of Christianity , Keller infuses a social dimension into his gospel definition .Keller 's gospel is more than the good news that Christ has come to reconcile us to God ; it is also solving the world 's problems of injustice , poverty and healing the troubles of this earth .He quotes N. T.

{"text":"[ 7 ] Together all of these threads were drawn together during the second half of the nineteenth century to produce a radical makeover in Christianity .The cardinal doctrines held dear by evangelicals since at least the Reformation were now being jettisoned .And with the denial of essential biblical truth came a shift in the focus and purpose of the church .If the incarnation was in doubt , and the Scriptures suspect , and theology itself under attack , then that left social action as the mission of the church .And thus was born what would be called the \" social gospel .\" Church historian David Bebbington informs us , \" The most characteristic doctrine of the social gospelers , that the kingdom of God was to be realized by social improvement , was derived primarily from the German liberal Albrecht Ritschl .\" [ 8 ] However , it is important to realize that the social gospel did not overwhelm the gospel of spiritual salvation all at once .For some time , \" There was much agreement in America that the gospel was primarily a matter of spiritual salvation , but that under modern conditions it was also necessary to strive for social reform .In its origins the social gospel movement was in large part a broadening expression of evangelicalism .\" [ 9 ] .Perhaps doctrine increasingly took a back seat to social action because of pressure by influential people like George Elliot who taught , as many increasingly do today , that \" salvation of the individual soul was not sufficient .Society must be saved as well as Christians .\" [ 10 ] Nevertheless , evangelical forces held their ground during most of the latter half of the century , but their front lines began to crumble by the last decade and the war was essentially lost by the turn of the century .Many pockets of resistance remained for a time , but by the twentieth century the liberals could claim virtual victory .And with that victory not only had the great truths of Scripture been undermined but the purpose of the church had been shifted from fulfillment of the Great Commission with its emphasis on evangelism and discipleship to the social gospel and saving society from itself .Probably no one has described the social gospel better than H. Richard Niebuhr who famously wrote , \" A God without wrath brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment through the ministrations of a Christ without a Cross .\" [ 11 ] .By the early 1900s , most theological liberals had made social concerns central to their understanding of the gospel .[ 12 ] The theology of the day was increasing acceptance of Darwinian theories , higher critical attacks on the Bible and Freudian redefining of human nature .In light of these modern challenges to the Bible and conservative evangelical thought , liberal theologians believed Christianity needed to change to survive .That which was unacceptable to modern man , such as the incarnation , the atonement , creationism , inspiration and authority of Scripture , etc . , had to be rejected .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"77.742935"}
{"text":"Christendom inevitably led to a view of \" missions \" as a program of the church while its de facto mission remained centered on the institutional maintenance of the church .In the Missional Church : A Vision for the Sending of the Church in North America , the authors offer critical insight into the problem .Written in response to research inaugurated by the Gospel and Our Culture Network , a diverse team of Evangelical theologians writes : .We have come to see that mission is not merely an activity of the church .Rather , mission is the result of God 's initiative , rooted in God 's purposes to restore and heal creation . \" Mission \" means \" sending , \" and it is the central biblical theme describing the purpose of God in human history ....We have begun to learn that the biblical message is more radical , more inclusive , more transforming than we have allowed it to be ....We have begun to see that the church of Jesus Christ is not the purpose or goal of the gospel , but rather its instrument and witness .God 's mission embraces all of creation .Using this definition , the authors point out that \" neither the structures nor the theology of our established Western traditional churches is missional .They are shaped by the legacy of Christendom \" and given the fact that the present cultural context is increasingly resistant to \" member recruitment , \" the American church is scrambling to define its mission .Many churches have recently begun to use the term \" missional \" but this is often nothing more than a new word for evangelism operating under the same old assumptions of Christendom .It neither fully considers the post - Christian cultural context or the all - encompassing redemptive mission of God .Because so many churches still labor under the illusion of Christendom their response to this loss of cultural relevance and missional ineffectiveness often ends up being misguided .\" The typical North American response to our situation is to analyze the problem and find a solution .These solutions tend to be methodological .Arrange all the components of the church landscape differently , and many assume that the problem can be solved .Or use the best demographic or psychological or sociological insights , and one can redesign the church for success in our changing context . \"( Missional Church , p. 2 )This inevitably results in the church trying to look like the world in order to be relevant when what is needed is an intelligent and loving representation of the Truth that is relevant to what the world really needs .The latter requires that the church better understand the cultural context , dominant ideas and worldviews shaping our culture .These worldviews , which purport to offer an all - embracing life system , must be met with a Christianity that offers an \" equally comprehensive and far reaching power \" in the words of Abraham Kuyper .It is , in large part , the church 's present inability to both recognize the changing cultural context and to assert an all - encompassing view of the Christian faith and message that has rendered the church irrelevant and left it confused with regard to its purpose and mission .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"78.09048"}

Hobhouse who wrote early in the 20th century that the primary value of liberalism was no longer freedom , but harmony .The primary value of liberalism today is the Epicurean value of avoiding pain , whether it be the pain of inequality , the pain of difference , suspicion of disapproval , or guilt with regard to the sacrifices required to accomplish something .Nietzsche squarely identified this in his critique of the Last Man , and of egalitarianism , but mistakenly identified these with Judaism and Christianity .I suspect that Epicureanism , now and anciently , is based on a metaphysical foundation that denies and negates its own sacrificial origins .Christianity is not metaphysical and does not deny and negate its sacrificial origin , but instead identifies the sacrificial mechanism of culture and calls on us to acknowledge and manage sacrifice while fulfilling the Law , at whatever sacrifice that entails .Most of Jesus ' teaching bear on cultivating a spiritual orientation that will bring individuals and communities closer to God .Individuals and communities are invested in many forms of capital , material , relational , cultural , and spiritual .With his God's - eye view into human beings , Jesus teaches us to appreciate and critique those investments .Do they bar us from God , or are they part of our life in community with Him ? \"Suicidally sacrificial liberal interpretations of Christianity \" involve a destructive refusal to recognize the material , relational , cultural , and spiritual capital of individuals and communities .That is totally anti - Christian .Instead , it is Epicurean , a quest for the wrong kind of peace .Resentment of own contemporary societies fuels liberal Christians , who are willing to sacrifice their own social capital and that of others to protect our victims from our injustice .Resentment causes them to massively devalue social capital that does not in fact bar us from God but it the essence of our life with Him .In sum , I agree that a fully satisfactory argument against liberal Christianity can be made , but if Christianity is supplementary and critical by nature , it need not provide a comprehensive guide for living in society .Tom S. writes : .As always , liberals \" cherry pick \" the parts that they like .As George Patton once told a pacifist , \" Read the WHOLE Bible , not just the parts you like or agree with .It may surprise you ... .\" 2 )The New Testament is not all that there is to Christianity .The Old Testament is included in the Bible for a reason , and there is no contradiction between the two .The attempt to read the Old Testament out of Christianity was a heresy , called \" Marcionism , \" and it was , according to the Catholic Encyclopedia , the \" most dangerous heresy that the Church ever faced .\" When we read in the Epistles of Paul of people \" consulting the Scriptures \" that was the Old Testament - the New Testament had not yet been compiled .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"78.188446"}

{"text":"As we follow the shows of the Pope - superstar , we do not realize that the Church in fact is no longer an absolute monarchy , but a sort of constitutional monarchy where we do not know the constitution or the identity of the effective prime minister .The book Jesus of Nazareth ( San Francisco : Ignatius Press , 2011 , pp .362 ) is principally a work of exegesis , which is the interpretation of the Holy Scripture .Exegesis is one of the richest sources of Catholic thought .To have an idea of this richness , it suffices to think of the portentous number of quotes by Fathers and Doctors of the Church offered to us in the Commentaries of the Scriptures by Fr .Cornelius a Lapide .He draws together the great minds of the Church showing their contribution to the unity of the Catholic interpretation of Scriptures .From the 16th century , when a Lapide wrote his work , to the 20th century , this chain became continuously stronger and more consistent .It is a luminous and unbroken tradition of orthodoxy and militancy against error that powerfully reflects the unity of the Catholic Faith and helps the faithful on the path to sanctity .One would expect , therefore , that Pope Benedict XVI would follow that tradition in the book he wrote .It is a vain hope ; this book is not a link in the chain of that tradition .The author practically ignores the 2,000 years of Catholic exegesis .Certainly there are some few quotes of this or that Father or Doctor of the Church , but they are submerged in the much larger number of Progressivist and Protestants authors he cites .It is unpleasant for a Catholic to see Ratzinger bowing respectfully each time he quotes a Protestant .The authors he cites follow the historical method initiated by the liberal Protestants in the 1800s .The Papacy has been constantly diminished ; kissing babies everywhere entered its new agenda .Benedict praises this current to which he unabashedly belongs : \" One thing is clear to me : in 200 years of exegetical work , historical - critical exegesis has already yielded its essential fruit \" ( p. XIV ) .We know that Leo XIII condemned the premises of the historical method when it jeopardizes the divine authority of Scriptures .It was also condemned by St. Pius X and Pius XII for its evolutionist philosophy and its relativization of faith , morals , exegesis , etc . .Besides this first clash with Catholic doctrine in this book , many others are present .If the book were published 100 years ago , these errors would be the easy target of the valorous inquisitors of the Holy Office .I will not focus on them in this article .Denial of a physical Heaven .The point I want to analyze here , which seems to me ' the scoop ' on Benedict 's book , is that now we have a Pope who clearly denies the existence of Heaven .So , Benedict XVI denies that Christ ascended to Heaven , a physical place where He dwells with His resurrected body in the company of the Blessed Virgin Mary , also present there body and soul .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"81.0585"}

{"text":"Of course , this is common knowledge among those of us who study the ancient world : the narratives of persecution in popular consciousness owe more to Hollywood movies ( something I 've presented papers on ) than to anything historical .In reality , persecution was not very widespread nor prolonged .It did happen , but not because of Christians ' belief in a single god , and indeed , not really because of their \" beliefs \" at all .Roman religion was largely ambivalent about belief -- people worshiped a variety of gods , and those cults usually coexisted just fine .Rather , Roman religion was ultimately concerned with the proper ways to go about performing the imperial cult , and here is where it often ran into conflict with Christians .Your run - of - the - mill Isis or Mithras initiate did n't see any problem with participating in the state cult -- it was part of being Roman .But Christians did -- they either rejected the existence of the gods of the state or , worse yet , considered sacrifice to them to be nourishing the demons they really were .The Romans were upset by this : here was a group of individuals refusing to participate in a ceremonial , patriotic exercise , who met in their own private assemblies ( another Roman anxiety ) and worshiped or venerated a man crucified as an enemy of the state .The refusal to participate in this coercive , religious practice was seen with the same suspicions that those on the Right reserve for people today who might fail to cover their hearts during the national anthem or opt out of saying the Pledge of Allegiance .( Note how both prayer and patriotism are we d in the teens ' video above : \" in school , prayer and pledge to the flag was welcomed and appreciated . \" )So the historical ironies of Christians equating religious coercion with religious freedom , and demonizing those whose consciences prompt them to opt out of ceremonial state exercises , abounds two- and threefold .Christians are not being \" persecuted , \" at least not in this country .It is true that a certain socio - religious ideology , claiming Christianity as its mantle , which condemns gay and lesbian people and relegates women to subordinates of their husbands , is indeed becoming increasingly rejected in our modern culture .But that itself is of course laden with irony as well : many Christians , like the hyperventilating teens in the video above , openly fret about being condemned and ostracized -- all simply because they insist on condemning and ostracizing others .6 comments : .I have come to realize that these types of Christians do not believe in religious freedom as most people define it .What they believe is that everyone is free to believe what they believe , and if they do n't then that must mean that they are being \" persecuted \" .This is actually not a new problem .The protestants that fled England due to religious persecution quickly set up their own forms of persecuting others .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"83.11987"}

{"text":"11 ] All that we do as citizens of God 's kingdom points to the transformative spiritual restoration carried out by the covenant Lord in order that a mass of perdition might become a multitude of praise .To fix a decaying neighborhood , to tutor underprivileged students , to show kindness to disabled people , and to make soul - stirring art - all these can and very definitely do give glory to God when done with a doxological heart .But these realities do not point to an abstract work of restoration .Rather , they testify to the power of the cross , the death and resurrection of Christ , which clears the guilty and enfranchises them to serve as bearers of the word of salvation in a thousand different spheres .QUESTION TWO : IS THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH TO RESTORE ?Flowing from the first critique about the nature of the gospel is a second : Lyons suggests that the mission of people gripped by the \" restoring \" gospel is , well , to restore .Though he does not engage deeply with Scripture on this point , Lyons cites Colossians 1 to make the case that the gospel is about more than merely saving one 's soul : .Two thousand years after the Christ event , people are still on earth and the hope is not diminished .Paul tells us in Colossians 1 , that Christ 's shed blood began a restorative work affecting the eternal things of heaven as well as the here and now events on earth .More than simply offering us a postmortem destination , God commissioned us to share his whole story and become conduits for him to bring healing to earth and its residents .Like a capstone to the story of God , Christians are called to partner in a restorative work so that the torch of hope is carried until Christ returns .He concludes the point portentously : \" This is the story of God .The whole story .\" [ 12 ] .Lyons is surely right that the work of Christ has implications for all of life and for all of creation .However , his contention is worth probing a bit .Nowhere in Colossians 1 does Paul explicitly state that believers are to \" bring healing \" to the world .[ 13 ] The point of Colossians 1 is what Christ has done .The closest it comes to discussing what we must do are Paul 's words about \" proclaiming \" the mystery of what Christ has done ( Col . 1:28 ) .[14 ] .Now , Paul says that one of the goals of his proclamation is to present believers \" mature in Christ , \" which , no doubt , might include the types of things Lyons is after .Still , the text simply does n't say that , because it 's not about that .It 's about Christ 's work .If Lyons still wants to insist that Paul means to imply all this , then he should take us to the text which says so .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"84.54451"}

{"text":"Such are the Zoroastrian Avesta and the Rig Veda , a hymn collection that 's the earliest and most important of Hinduism 's four central scriptures .Tradition says the Hindu text dates back countless thousands of years ; western experts believe that at minimum it originated prior to Moses , the traditional author of the Bible 's first five books .Similarly , the remarkable survival of Judaism despite oppression could be attributed to its incomparable Tanakh ( Christians ' \" Old Testament \" ) .As Simon Schama 's new book The Story of the Jews says , the Hebrew Bible provided \" compact , transferable history , law , wisdom , poetic chant , prophecy , consolation and self - strengthening counsel . \"With the Bible came articulated belief in the one God , developed scriptural moral codes and laws , and bookish intellectual rigor growing from biblical study and commentary , all resulting in strong ethnic solidarity .Today 's world Jewish population is 15 million .Though Judaism has survived , like Zoroastrianism it seems destined to gradually fade as secularized Jews defect from belief in God and study and practice of their ancestral faith , alongside higher intermarriage and lower birth rates .The struggle against temptations from rival Mideast religions consumed much of the Hebrew Bible and involved morality as well as idolatry .One overriding issue was the Bible 's denunciations of child sacrifice , notably the cult of Molech specified alongside the sexual code in Leviticus 18 and 20 .The later Greeks and Romans opposed child sacrifice to gods but practiced infanticide , which biblical Jews and later Christians abhorred .By civilized consensus , secular as well as religious , both child sacrifice and infanticide became repellent .More on ancient faiths in Babylon and elsewhere that were destined to die .Analysts say they lacked high scriptures and offered a confusing jumble of innumerable localized deities that were capricious , all too human , and morally suspect .Belief was bound up with idols , magic , oracles , and unappealing exertions to appease various gods .Christianity eventually supplanted the religions of the Greeks and the Romans , whose aristocracy was apparently more devoted to the officially favored faiths than the masses .Finally , it is evident that living religions exceeded dying ones in expressions of love and charity .Universality , probably fostered by faith in one God , became an aspect of a religion 's appeal as global exploration ensued .Of the world 's two largest religions , Christianity is disseminated more widely than Islam in both geography and ethnicity and it claims more adherents .For Muslims in whatever land , command of the Quran 's Arabic language is necessary for full knowledgeable participation .By contrast , Christians worship and read the Bible in all languages and even invent written forms of remote groups ' oral languages to translate biblical texts .Though Christianity is at home in the broadest possible variety of cultures , it remains marginalized or absent in much of the Muslim world , while Islam makes steady inroads in traditionally Christian countries that practice religious toleration .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"85.54523"}
{"text":"You serpents , you brood of vipers , how are you to escape being sentenced to hell ?One has to balance the testimony of Christ carefully , but the judgment aspect of his first coming is present throughout the Gospels .Luke 12:51 reads \" Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth ?No , I tell you , but rather division .\" The same is true of Paul , whom Lyons reads as an engager : .Apart from Jesus , a better example hardly exists for the restoration - minded Christian than Paul 's .Not only did he show up and engage - he showed compassion and grace to anyone who would listen .It appears his desire for people to be restored to Christ overcame any urges to be offended by their sin .[17 ] .Both Jesus and Paul surely reached out to sinners with compassion .Paul is a model for us in our interactions with lost people .But Lyons 's effort to compel Christians to be \" provoked , not offended , \" and to ground this call in the example of these men needs a bit of filling out .Paul was certainly offended by Peter 's separation from supposedly \" unclean \" Gentiles ( Gal .2:11 - 13 ) ; he was offended by the sin of homosexuality and denounced it at length ( Rom . 1 ) ; and more than being offended , he was deeply angered by sexual immorality in the Corinthian church ( 1 Cor .Paul had great concern for holiness and so must we .Our first task as Christians is to present ourselves holy to the Lord through the power of the Holy Spirit ( 1 Pet .We will do well in some cases to avoid projecting an external sense of being offended by the sins of the lost , as such is the natural outworking of our depraved natures , and so Lyons has a point here .His understanding of Jesus and Paul , however , needs more substantive biblical engagement .QUESTION FOUR : IS EVANGELISM BORING ?In line with the foregoing , I wonder if Lyons 's conception of evangelism needs a bit of reworking as well .Consider the following passage , in which he makes the case that removing \" restoration \" from the gospel cuts the meaning out of Christianity for many : .The next Christians claim that the beginning ( God 's goodness throughout creation ) and the ending ( the restoration of all things ) of the greater story have been conveniently cut out , leaving modern - day Christians with an incoherent understanding of the Gospel .Many are bound to a Gospel story with a climax that feels actually quite boring .\" Go tell others how to escape from Planet Earth \" does n't feel like a compelling mission to them .Sure , they want to help others come to know the way of Jesus , but they believe their story should affect real lives and situations now .Not just in the afterlife .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"85.96004"}

But I do wonder if he reframes the ministry of Jesus and Paul to fit his restoration paradigm .He describes Jesus , for example , in terms of being loving and healing : .Sinners loved Jesus .They literally followed Jesus everywhere .They pursued him from town to town .He spent days with them , meeting their friends , eating meals in their homes , accepting their gifts , and embracing their children .They were suspended in disbelief at encounters with someone who understood truth and beauty , healing and restoration , righteousness , justice , mercy , and grace - and He genuinely loved them .[ 15 ] .The judgment aspect of the ministry of Christ is explicitly set aside : . [Restorers ] work with people of different faiths to relieve social injustice in their communities .They are driven by the belief that Jesus himself was more concerned with engagement than condemnation .As John writes , \" For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world , but to save the world through him \" ( Jn .[ 16 ] .It is of course true that Jesus healed the sick , ministered to the marginalized , and brought beauty to an often ugly world .What glorious truths these are !But he was n't merely the Great Restorer .The accent of his ministry was surely one of mercy and love .However , there is also a strong note of judgment , condemnation and warning in Christ 's teaching .Jesus came not just to restore but to tear down .The \" already - not yet \" theme in view here applies not only to salvation but also to judgment .Consider the words of Matthew 23:32 - 35 : .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.3569"}

{"text":"What sets Christianity apart from the other religions in this respect is the Incarnation .\" No one knows the Father but the Son ; \" since we have become acquainted with the Son , we are better informed than others .The Incarnation also explains why Christ 's sacrifice was efficacious , whereas those of Balder and Adonis were not : for the latter are mere angels , so that their sacrifices were pale inadequate imitations of the real , true sacrifice .At best they were sacraments , rather than the thing itself that they signified .This in a nutshell describes all forms of idolatry : they mistake a sign for the reality to which it refers , and from which it derives ; they confuse for Truth a partial quotation thereof .Some of the Fathers considered Plato a prophet , and they revered Jesus ' Alexandrian Jewish contemporary Philo .They did n't shrink from calling the Feast of the Resurrection after the pagan Goddess of the Dawn , Eostre , with whose spring festival it was coincident , because they had always called Jesus the Son of the Morning Star .To them , the Pagan festival in honor of Eostre was obviously a pale imitation of the true Pascha .Christianity presupposes that people are religious , and legitimately so ; if they were not , they would have no interest in Christianity .Rather the same sorts of things can be said of Christianity 's interface with other human institutions .Few are wholly bad ; all could be better with the correction of the Gospel .It presupposes also that humanity is ineluctably parochial , whereas the Church is catholic .So it is that Christianity has flourished under all sorts of political arrangements : Imperial Rome , Medieval feudalism , modern democratic capitalism .Also , because the Truth is a reproach to all forms of error , idolatry and sin in every age and clime , wherever Christianity has flourished , it has really improved its social hosts , such as the Aztecs , the Canaanites and the Britons .True , the Gospel is not primarily about social or political arrangements , but about the Ultimate Reality and how we should behave in virtue thereof , in this world - the only one that can matter to us for the time being - and in the next .But that does not mean that a correct religious orientation to the Ultimate Truth has no effect on worldly life .If you put anything ahead of the will of God , anything at all , then you are ipso facto sinning , thus suffering , more than you would otherwise be .That I am Christian makes me , not more like some other Christian - Lawrence , say , or St. Francis or Mother Teresa - but more like my own better self .At the same time , the more Christian I become , the more I will express Christian virtues , as Lawrence , Francis , and Teresa also all variously do .So with cultures .The effect upon any culture of conversion to Christianity should be , not its destruction , but that it should begin to learn how best to express its truest , best essence .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"93.61301"}

{"text":"Reading on , he further enlightens his reader .The Gospels & 2,000 years of Church teaching on the Ascension are supposedly mistaken ... .On the next page , interpreting the cloud on which Our Lord stood as he rose to Heaven , Benedict affirms that such cloud never existed .He casts doubt on all biblical descriptions of this type .He also reinforces his first denial of Heaven as a physical place when he states : . \" This reference to the cloud is unambiguously theological language .It presents Jesus ' departure , not as a journey to the stars , but as his entry into the mystery of God .It evokes an entirely different order of magnitude , a different dimension of being \" ( p. 282 ) .Theological language for Benedict is a language that does not reflect an objective report of the events .Instead , he sees the cloud as a metaphor used to transmit a theological point .Benedict XVI , therefore , imagines that description as a symbol - and nothing but a symbol - to express that Christ entered the \" mystery of God . \"However , since the \" mystery of God \" is not an easy concept to decode , the only clear point is that Benedict reaffirms here his denial of both the Ascension of Our Lord to Heaven and the reality of Heaven as a physical place .Further on , commenting on the truth we profess in the Creed that Our Lord is seated at the right hand of the Father , he writes : . \"The New Testament , from the Acts of the Apostles to the Letter to the Hebrews , describes the ' place ' to which the cloud took Jesus , using the language of Psalm 110:1 , as sitting ( or standing ) at God 's right hand .What does this mean ?It does not refer to some distant cosmic space where God has , as it were , set up his throne and given Jesus a place beside the throne .God is not in one space alongside other spaces .God is God - he is the premise and the ground of all the space there is , but he himself is not part of it .God stands in relation to all spaces as Lord and Creator .His presence is not special , but divine . 'Sitting at God 's right hand ' means participating in this divine dominion over space \" ( pp .282 - 283 ) .Here Benedict supplies a reason for his denial of the throne of God , which seems also to be the reason for his denial of Heaven as a physical place .I summarize his reasoning in this way : .Conclusion : Therefore , Jesus can not be in a place at the right hand of God .I believe that the major premise is correct applied to the time when man was awaiting the Messiah .God is a pure spirit who is present where He manifests himself .He does not rely on space .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"95.95606"}
