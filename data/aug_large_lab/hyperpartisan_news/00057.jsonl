{"text":"The Kasich ad is by far the darkest attack so far made against Trump by any candidate - Republican or Democrat .And it raises a disturbing question : .If Donald Trump is America 's Adolf Hitler , who will be its Claus von Stauffenberg ?Colonel Claus Schenk von Stuaffenberg was the German army officer who , on July 20 , 1944 , tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler .He had served with the Wehrmacht in Poland ( 1939 ) , France ( 1940 ) and the Soviet Union ( 1941 ) .While serving in Tunisa , he was seriously wounded on April 7 , 1943 when Allied fighters strafed his vehicle .He lost his left eye , right hand and two fingers of his left hand after surgery .Nevertheless , he now acted as the prime mover for the conspiracy among a growing number of German high command officers to arrest or assassinate Germany 's Fuehrer .For most of these officers , the motive was craven : Germany was losing the war it had launched on the world - and they feared the worst .This was especially true now that the numerically superior forces of the Soviet Union had gone onto the offensive .For Stauffenberg , there was another reason : His disgust at the horrors he had seen committed by his fellow Wehrmacht soldiers upon defenseless POW 's and civilians in Russia .Thus , Stauffenberg - more than many Germans - knew firsthand the vengeance his country could expect if the \" 1,000 year Reich \" fell .Something must be done , he believed , to prove to the world that not all Germans - even members of the Wehrmacht -were criminals .Most of the conspirators wanted to arrest Hitler and surrender to British and American forces - well before the much - feared Russians gained a toehold in Germany .For Stauffenberg , arresting Hitler was n't enough .Stauffenberg wanted him dead .A live Hitler might eventually be rescued by his Nazi colleagues .Sixth , according to U.S. defense reports , Syria has weapons of mass destruction - and the ballistic missiles to deliver them .Syria has an active chemical weapons program , including significant reserves of the deadly nerve agent sarin .The recent destruction of much of Syria 's WMD stockpile - at the demand of President Barack Obama - doesn't erase its ability to create more .And this is likely to re - occur as soon as the United States becomes preoccupied with other concerns .Seventh , the United States had no part in creating the Assad regime .Thus , Americans have no moral obligation to support those Syrians trying to overthrow it .Moreover , Syria has never been an American ally - and has , in fact , directed terrorism against American forces stationed in Beirut , Lebanon .On October 23 , 1983 , Syrian suicide bombers drove trucks into two buildings housing American and French military forces .Total killed : 299 .In short , the United States owes Syria nothing .Eighth , China and Russia are fully supporting the Assad dictatorship - and the brutalities it commits against its own citizens .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.01337"}

Gabrielle Giffords ( D - Ariz . )She probably will not win the primary , but some important Republicans wish she would .To say she was off the political grid prior to her candidacy is an understatement .Her announcement speech set up was amateurish .Even people on her own payroll will describe her nascent campaign as \" rag tag .\" The video of her announcement intrigued political consultant Christian Morgan of Axiom Strategies so much that he and his team tracked McSally down and pitched working with her .\" The American people are thirsting for leadership these days .They do n't see it in the other opponents , \" Morgan said earlier this week . \" Five days out from the primary , Martha 's surging , \" .There are three other candidates in the GOP nomination hunt .Each has more established ties to Tucson , Ariz. , than the 46-year - old McSally , who has lived in the area off and on over the past 10 years , some of the time while on military assignment .During her 28 years in the military , McSally was a prominent figure .She broke gender barriers as the first female combat pilot in the Air Force .But when told \" no \" on various policies , she fought the bureaucracy with research and litigation , even going to Congress .McSally made the most waves when she challenged the military 's policy of forcing women to wear abayas off - base while stationed in Saudi Arabia .Over the course of that debate , she was featured in newspaper articles and appeared on \" 60 Minutes . \"And she won .As for her current Congressional run , she was rarely even mentioned in early news articles as a contender .Jesse Kelly , who barely lost to Giffords in 2010 , is expected to emerge the winner of Tuesday 's special GOP contest .But McSally popped in the news because of her reaction to then - presidential candidate Rick Santorum 's opposition to women in combat .\" I really just wanted to go kick him in the jimmy , \" she said on Fox News . \"He 's totally out of touch .\" The turning point for McSally came in early March .She traveled to Washington , D.C. , and met with journalists , fundraisers and party powerbrokers .Most knew little about her , but she left many impressed .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.63743"}
{"text":"Cruz was born in Calgary , Alberta , Canada , to an American mother and a Cuban father .The U.S. Constitution states specifically that \" No person except a natural born Citizen ... shall be eligible to the Office of President .Cruz has argued that because his mother was an American , he became an American citizen at birth .But courts have never ruled on the issue of what constitutes a \" natural - born \" citizen .At first , the issue seemed confined to Republican politicians and those likely to vote for them .But then others outside the Right began investigating it .Mary McManamon , a constitutional law professor at Widener University 's Delaware Law School , concluded in an Open Editorial for The Washington Post : . \"Sen. Ted Cruz ( R - Tex . ) is not a natural - born citizen and therefore is not eligible to be president or vice president of the United States .Cruz got an even bigger slap in the face from Laurence Tribe , the celebrated professor of Constitutional law at Harvard University .He has argued before the United States Supreme Court 36 times .Writing in The Boston Globe , Tribe stated : . \" ...The kind of judge Cruz says he admires and would appoint to the Supreme Court is an ' originalist , ' one who claims to be bound by the narrowly historical meaning of the Constitution 's terms at the time of their adoption . \" To his kind of judge , Cruz ironically would n't be eligible , because the legal principles that prevailed in the 1780s and ' 90s required that someone actually be born on US soil to be a \" natural born \" citizen .\" [ Italics added . ]So long as Cruz stays in the race , Trump will continue to use the \" birther \" charge against him .And it will continue to dog him , as it did Obama .In March , 2015 , a group claiming affiliation with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) took responsibility for posting online the names , photos , street addresses , and , in some cases , ranks , of 100 American military service members .And it called upon its Islamic \" brothers residing in America \" to kill them .Calling itself Islamic State Hacking Division , the group said that it obtained this information by hacking military servers , databases and emails .But an unnamed Defense Department official quoted by the New York Times downplayed the claim that government databases had been hacked .After the information was posted , the Pentagon announced that it was investigating the matter .So is the FBI .Local police were asked to step up patrols in the neighborhoods where the target service members lived .Meanwhile , the Pentagon proved itself at a loss to deal with this new threat of Islamic terrorists using the Internet as a recruiting tool .The agency did n't ask YouTube to take down the posted message until a CBS News reporter asked if it had done so .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.63872"}
{"text":"Oppressors vs. Oppressed .Another example would arise when such a president addressed religion : often taking the side of Muslims , seldom siding with Christians .From the far Left viewpoint , this is n't an issue of religion at all , but rather the ideal of always siding with the Oppressed minority against the Oppressive majority .I do n't know if this critique is an accurate portrayal of the current president .I do n't know him , so I 'm left with what the media shares .But this critique certainly explains a lot of his behaviors , and many of his words .It is indicative of many on the far Left .For example , when asked who her worst enemies were , Hillary Clinton mentioned terrorists as a problem but ended up calling \" Republicans \" her worst enemies .She later said it was a joke .But the fact that she and many others laughed at the joke , and found it funny , is telling .People on both sides of the political divide frequently make this mistake , thinking that other Americans are really the great enemy , when so many worse enemies are out there ( e.g. terrorists , Iran , Russia , China , North Korea , etc . ) .What are the Solutions ?In all this , the real issue for most Americans is one of leadership .We are a nation divided .Divided about who the good guys are , and who the bad guys really are .A nation where the majority of people do n't assume that the police are the good guys is in deep trouble .Very deep trouble .Yet our current President has seemed to signal this very thing on numerous occasions .This is a big problem .Perhaps just as big , if not even bigger , is the President 's inability to passionately call out terrorism and unite the nation in defeating it .His attacks on terrorism seem half - hearted .For example , during the first Gulf War the allies sent out an average of nearly 1200 bombing sorties a day .In contrast , during the anti - ISIS attacks over the past 18 months , the Obama group has sent on average 6 - 8 sorties a day .That 's not a typo .It 's 1200 a day , versus 6 - 8 day .That 's a huge difference !In short , those on the far Left are n't really interested in foreign issues .They are focused on reformatting America , using government to transfer more and more power , money , and influence from the \" Oppressive middle and upper classes \" to the \" Oppressed \" under classes .Foreign policy is a distraction for them .They are annoyed when foreign policy problems come up at all , and wish they would just go away .For example , the President truly seems more passionate about taking away guns from law - abiding American citizens than he is about stopping terrorists .With that kind of fuzzy leadership , not much is going to get done .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.68146"}
