{"text":"From 2000 ( the Ravens Super Bowl winning year ) through the present , the Lewis - led Baltimore defense finished among the league 's Top 4 defenses 7 of 13 years ... and only 3 times finished outside of the Top 10 .In short , Ray Lewis ' energetic play and inspirational demeanor is unquestioned , and he is a large reason for the team 's defensive success over the years .But how much of the franchise 's $ 1.16 billion estimated worth ( as of Forbes ' 2012 valuation estimates ) is he responsible for ?Let 's account for inflation so we can compare apples to apples .Multiplying the 1997 estimated nominal franchise value ( $ 329 million ) by a factor of approximately 1.433 ( the ratio of the 2012 and 1997 CPIs ) implies that the 1997 franchise value measured in current 2012 dollars was roughly $ 470 million .This yields a $ 690 million disparity between the 2012 and 1997 franchise values .How much of that additional $ 690 million can be attributed to Ray Lewis ?First , we must account for the financial consequences associated with a team that receives a new stadium .As the time series data on the team 's revenues from the late 1990s and early 2000s shows , revenues realized a larger spike once the team started playing at M&T Bank Stadium than even after their World Championship .For example , team revenue for 1998 ( the first year of the new stadium ) was $ 120 million ... or an increase of 64 % over the $ 73 million earned in 1997 .Conversely , team revenues for the 2000 championship season were $ 139 million ... or an increase of 13 % over the $ 123 million earned in 1999 .Throughout the 2000s , there were no one - year percentage increases in revenue that even approached the 64 % increase generated from the new stadium effect .In short , without a relatively new stadium , the Ravens would be more apt to have a franchise value in the $ 800 - 900 million range .Thus , a new stadium in my estimation explains between one - third to one - half of the $ 690 million boost in franchise value experienced during Lewis ' tenure .Second , we must account for the team 's success .To appreciate the importance of success , consider that the Cleveland Browns play in a newer stadium ( 1999 ) but their franchise value is roughly $ 200 million less than the Ravens despite having a larger TV market than Baltimore .Explanation ?The Browns have only reached the playoffs once since 1999 ( 2002 ) , and this drives their value down relative to markets ( like Baltimore ) that regularly win .But how much of the credit for that consistent success goes to Ray Lewis compared to his teammates ' collective efforts or the Harbaugh coaching regime ?Coach Harbaugh has already reached the postseason more times in 5 seasons ( 5 ) than Brian Billick accomplished ( 4 ) in 9 seasons .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"75.5895"}

{"text":"Yet this is to misread not merely libertarianism , but even Randianism itself .For Romney 's \" 47 percent \" remarks ( which observers should note , tied the capacity for virtuous citizenship purely to paying taxes ) were not libertarian .Rather , they were feudal .Romney posited a theory of two static classes , inexorably opposed to each other : the virtuous , taxpaying business owners / otherwise wealthy people , and the ungrateful serfs who pay nothing into the system and leech off their largesse .Similarly , someone who was once part of the upper echelons of the 53 percent could utterly destroy their own fortune due to hubris and criminal behavior , thus ending up in the 47 percent .This is how mobility works , and it 's one of the most important defenses of capitalism there is , having been made by the likes of Thomas Sowell and Milton Friedman .Ayn Rand herself acknowledged this when , in Atlas Shrugged , she cast figures such as the diner employee and former professor Hugh Akston ( who is not a wealthy man ) as explicitly more virtuous than the wealthy but corrupt subsidized steel magnate Orren Boyle .That being said , upward mobility is in woefully short supply in America today , and libertarian populists ( especially Carney himself ) are often brilliant in their exposition of the reasons why .In fact , much of their policy program would probably do a great deal to ameliorate the lack of upward mobility , and to eliminate the Orren Boyles of the world .Unfortunately , the libertarian virtues of their policy program are almost entirely voided by the utterly counterproductive decision to we d that program to populist policies , ideas and rhetoric .Before getting into why , let us return to Rand for a moment , because she works as a particularly extreme example of what many libertarians believe ( she certainly was a gateway drug for me ) .If her message ( and , indeed , libertarianism 's ) really were the feudal nightmare that Romney 's critics make it out to be , there would be no way to explain the enormous mass appeal of books like Atlas Shrugged .There are simply not enough millionaires and billionaires to inflate sales that much , nor to explain its pop cultural impact , nor to explain the fact that it appeals just as much to entirely resourceless high school and college students as it does to the independently wealthy .So why the appeal ?Simple : Because Rand 's work , for all its many flaws , is not a feudal fantasy , but an aspirational one .Indeed , libertarianism is perhaps the perfect aspirational philosophy .Populism , by contrast , is almost entirely punitive .It seeks to drag down those who have achieved more than they ought to , to get revenge on the successful and to glorify the unsuccessful .Rush Limbaugh fingered this as precisely the reason why populism is a poor fit on the right in 2008 when he used it as a reason to criticize Mike Huckabee .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"98.36338"}
