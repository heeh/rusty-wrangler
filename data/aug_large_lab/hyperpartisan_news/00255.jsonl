{"text":"The unseen victims of homophobia ... .I 've said this before- I do n't think any simple hetero / homo sexual categorization is useful early or ever when there are so many complicating factors for survivors of sexual abuse .Normal sexual development gets derailed by CSA .My own wiring and Sexualization were tangled and damaged by what happened to me .Addiction , shame and isolation further complicated this .When I acted out sexually in later years , my sexuality got further confused and tangled .Ultimately I had to untangle my entire sexual development and learn to get some of my needs met in healthy ways , including learning intimacy .Deep inside , I still struggle with anger and a desire to control or even use others - deeply associated with my abuse .I think it 's different for everyone ( potentially ) .I was abused by a male , but turned out straight .I think for some the opposite may be true .For some , they knew they were gay before the CSA ...So it 's a crap shoot .It is important to recognize how abuse imprints the soul , because many people tend to think that it is mostly a question of repression that needs to be undone and dealt with .This means that to learn to fully be free from such history one needs to work on the structures that have developed throughout this abusive history and learn to disidentify from them , or bring them to a degree of flexibility and openness ._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ BrokenLeg@2 EarCutoff@5 RanOver@7 UnanethesizedSurgeries@8 rapedfrom10to11 Dysfunction&Druguse@12 Crime@13 Dotdotdot Violence Jail@18Escaped Prison@19GladiatorSchool Max@20 Supermax@21 HellEnsues THROWNbacktothestreets@26 MarriedWKids@28 HeardofCptsd@33 Seeking help And the days tick by all the same .I 've been thinking about this question , and here 's what bothers me about it .Maybe it 's just me , but I feel like it 's posed in a funny way , as if gayness needs to be explained or somehow blamed on CSA .And I do n't like that idea .I think gayness is fine .Straightness is fine .But then there 's the whole web of attraction and specific things that people like , all of which it seems depends on things in your life or the way you were wired .So I guess it makes sense that CSA has an impact on a person 's sexual identity .Plus , the confusion from CSA can make everything muddy .It 's all so fucked up and chaotic to me .Anyway , this probably is n't helpful to anyone so far , but consider this : Listen to Dan Savage ( Savage love podcast ) for a positive and sometimes wrenching point of view on sexuality .No matter what we are attracted to .And Dan Savage is nothing if not accepting .That does n't mean he accepts abuse , he does n't .He holds people accountable .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"20.871334"}

{"text":"The term genderedness refers to the state or condition of having two sexes that are naturally distinct .In addition to anatomical distinctions , males and females differ in many other ways .For example , we differ in the ways we relate , experience emotion , and communicate ; in our perceptions , thinking styles , and values .To develop a sense of genderedness , a boy must experience himself as masculine in ways that contrast with the femininity of girls and women .Being identified and overfamiliar with females washes out that contrast .Distorted views of the female gender , together with distorted perceptions of himself , can prevent a boy from developing a sense that girls are complementary to his maleness .Distorted views of the female gender , together with distorted perceptions of himself in relation to females , can prevent a boy from developing a sense that girls , and later women , are complementary to his maleness .He may become unable to recognize the favorable relationship that can exist between the two sexes where the natural traits of each fulfill , balance , and refine the other .He may not perceive females as desirable or as having something valuable to contribute to him .And he may not experience himself as having something valuable to contribute to a woman .From this perspective , females would not seem attractive .Heterosexuality seems to depend on genderedness and complementarity .Heterosexuality seems to depend on genderedness and complementarity .Men must see women as distinct from them - excitingly different , exotic , and mysterious - and as providing the opportunity for a mutually fulfilling and beneficial relationship .Most homosexual men are not sexually attracted to women , perhaps in part because they have experienced at least some of the issues described above .In contrast , we have noticed that homosexual men who have not experienced these issues often report attractions to females in their past or present life .Feeling Incongruent With One 's Own Gender .Summary : Feeling incongruent with what a man believes his gender requires may create a psychologically unstable situation , resulting in the unconscious mind compensating through fixations or attractions toward males and masculinity .Many homosexual men report that , during childhood , they saw themselves as being at odds or out - of - sync with what they believed a boy is supposed to be .Essentially , their perspective of other males was , \" I am not like them and they are not like me - I am different .\" We refer to this condition as gender incongruity .While most boys and men may occasionally feel like they do n't fully measure up to their masculine ideal , boys experiencing gender incongruity tend to focus on these thoughts extensively .They experience a pervasive sense of lacking in vital qualities or capacities they consider essential for masculinity .And they may believe there is no way for them to obtain or grow into these qualities or capacities .Gender incongruity is a subjective experience , which means that it is based entirely on individual perspective .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"36.02928"}

{"text":"When early sexologists in the late 19th century began to categorize and describe homosexual behavior , hampered by a lack of knowledge about lesbianism or women 's sexuality , they distinguished lesbians as women who did not adhere to female gender roles and designated them mentally ill .Women in homosexual relationships responded to this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States .Following World War II , during a period of social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals , women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other .Greater economic and social freedom allowed women gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families .With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women 's history and sexuality in the 20th century , the definition of lesbian broadened , sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is .Women generally exhibit greater sexual fluidity than men and find it easier to become physically and emotionally intimate with the same sex than men do .Some women who engage in homosexual behavior may reject the lesbian identity entirely , refusing to identify themselves as lesbian or bisexual .Other women may adopt a lesbian identity for political reasons .Greater understanding of women 's sexuality has led to three components to identifying lesbians : sexual behavior , sexual desire , or sexual identity .Portrayals of lesbians in the media suggest that Western society at large has been simultaneously intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine gender roles , and fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women .Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity : as homosexuals , they are unified by the discrimination and potential rejection they face from their families , friends , and others .As women , they face concerns separate from men .Lesbians may encounter distinct physical or mental health concerns .Political conditions and social attitudes also affect the formation of lesbian relationships and families .Transgender is the state of one 's \" gender identity \" ( self - identification as woman , man , neither or both ) not matching one 's \" assigned sex \" ( identification by others as male , female or intersex based on physical / genetic sex ) .\" Transgender \" does not imply any specific form of sexual orientation ; transgender people may identify as heterosexual , homosexual , bisexual , pansexual , polysexual , or asexual ; some may consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them .People who identify as transgender or transsexual are usually people who are born with typical male or female anatomies but feel as though they 've been born into the \" wrong body .\" For example , a person who identifies as transgender or transsexual may have typical female anatomy but feel like a male and seek to become male by taking hormones or electing to have sex reassignment surgeries .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"36.886597"}

{"text":"Sexual orientation probably is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic , hormonal , and environmental influences .In recent decades , biologically based theories have been favored by experts .Although there continues to be controversy and uncertainty as to the genesis of the variety of human sexual orientations , there is no scientific evidence that abnormal parenting , sexual abuse , or other adverse life events influence sexual orientation .Current knowledge suggests that sexual orientation is usually established during early childhood .Despite almost a century of psychoanalytic and psychological speculation , there is no substantive evidence to support the suggestion that the nature of parenting or early childhood experiences play any role in the formation of a person 's fundamental heterosexual or homosexual orientation .It would appear that sexual orientation is biological in nature , determined by a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment .Sexual orientation is therefore not a choice , though sexual behaviour clearly is .No one knows what causes heterosexuality , homosexuality , or bisexuality .Homosexuality was once thought to be the result of troubled family dynamics or faulty psychological development .Those assumptions are now understood to have been based on misinformation and prejudice .The multiple aspects of sexual orientation and the boundary - drawing problems already described create methodological challenges for the study of the demographics of sexual orientation .Determining the frequency of various sexual orientations in real - world populations is difficult and controversial .Most modern scientific surveys find that the majority of people report a mostly heterosexual orientation .However , the relative percentage of the population that reports a homosexual orientation varies with differing methodologies and selection criteria .Estimates for the percentage of the population that are bisexual vary widely , at least in part due to differing definitions of bisexuality .A small percentage of people are not sexually attracted to anyone ( asexuality ) .Kinsey data .In the oft - cited and oft - criticized Sexual Behavior in the Human Male ( 1948 ) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female ( 1953 ) , by Alfred C.

{"text":"We have not seen success in changing the way individuals identify with their same - sex attraction .Parents who attempt to talk their gay - identified children into trying to change their sexuality tend to aggravate and alienate the child .Use of punishment and withdrawal of emotional or financial support to encourage change is hurtful and destructive and could lead to depression , anxiety , and suicidal feelings .Change - oriented therapy under these circumstances is not useful .However , therapy can be helpful in working through family conflict and resolving other issues so long as all parties accept that a shift in sexuality is not the goal .Spiritual challenges .Summary : same - sex attraction , like any challenge , can either bring a person closer to God or challenge their relationship with Him .In our extensive experience , nothing has ever indicated that homosexuality is caused by problems with spirituality .Nor does having same - sex attraction necessarily mean that an individual will have spiritual problems .In fact , for some members , the challenges with same - sex attraction increase their sense of connection with God , and the adherence to His commandments .They rely on God for help and seek the power of the Atonement in their lives .However , others will find their testimony is greatly challenged by their same - sex attraction .The intensity of their needs and desires can overwhelm the desire to live within the gospel plan .Satan can easily use those overwhelming feelings to tempt individuals to experiment and satisfy their intense urges .Some of these people may feel abandoned or betrayed by God , Church leadership , their families , or by other Church members .In addition , many men and women with same - sex attraction become predisposed to resent and mistrust males and those in authority .These issues tend to be deep - seated and result from problems in past relationships .We have found that showing profound love and acceptance toward these individuals can do much to lessen the intensity of these feelings .Nevertheless , therapy may be required to help the individual fully grow beyond these issues .What Causes Same - sex Attraction ?Summary : There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual , bisexual , gay or lesbian orientation .Same - sex attraction appears to be the result of a complex interaction of personality , biological inheritance , and developmental experiences .The American Psychological Association states the following : \" There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual , bisexual , gay or lesbian orientation .Although much research has examined the possible genetic , hormonal , developmental , social and cultural influences on sexual orientation , no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors .Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles ; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation .\" It is difficult to develop theories about the origins of homosexual attractions because no single theory fits every situation .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"37.96599"}

{"text":"When the sexual feelings are forced , unwanted , confusing and even painful , the association with the penis can be contaminated .Because the male abuser , particularly when there are negative feelings towards him , involves his penis in the acts , the result can be that some survivors may associate the penis with the hurt , betrayal , pain , humiliation , shame and guilt from the abuse .Think of the confusion you might feel from having these negative emotions about the abuse or abuser , and at the same time trying to feel good about your sexuality , and about a part of your body that is so central to your sexuality as your penis .Many survivors report a desire or temptation to look at the groins of other men , or at their exposed penises in situations like a changing room in school , gym , or at a swimming pool .For survivors , however , the penis may also be a symbol of the harm they have suffered .But notice once again how , when you experience these feelings , you are in fact also re - experiencing the control that the abuser had over you .Now , even though the abuse has ended and you no longer need fear harm from the abuser , these old defense mechanisms are still active .What the abuser did years ago still has the power to influence how you think and behave .One important consideration if you are sexual with other men , but you identify as heterosexual , is to look at why you desire to act sexually with them .One example of this is familiar with those who know or work with abused women .How many women in abusive relationships end their relationship , but then go back to the abusing partner or wind up with another man who turns out to be abusive as well ?This way of thinking leaves them in a situation where they find themselves in a repeating cycle of bad or abusive relationships .It may also be that you have been taught or conditioned that behaving in this way would bring closeness , acceptance or some other emotional need that you may not have had in your life at that time .Or you may have learned that by giving in , you would not be beaten or hurt more .Again , look at all these situations and you can see the continuing control of the abuser .The abuse is over , and perhaps the abuser is gone as well , but the emotional responses you learned as an abused boy are likely still with you .I have recently joined this website and am greatfull for all the support and information .It never entered my mind that I might have been born GAY and that is why even after being sexually abused or not I would have been gay .I lead a very sheltered life till College .Did n't even know there was a word for what I was feeling .I am a bit confused about how GOD feel about all this , but like everything else I 've experienced I will get through it .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"38.353046"}

{"text":"The term pedophile was invented by psychiatrists to classify those who have sexual interests in children .It attempts to describe the motivation and inner desires of a child abuser .It is also regularly used by sexual abuse ' experts ' and academicians to ' explain ' how male - on - male CSA is not an example of homosexuality but rather of pedophilia ( child victim ) or perhaps ephebophilia ( teenage victim ) .The problem with these terms is that motivations and desires are hard to pin down and may change over time or in different circumstances .Behavior is not only easier to assess and quantify , but is generally the best reflection of one 's motivations .This is why early in the AIDS epidemic , the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) stopped labeling individuals by sexual orientation and instead classified them by behavior ( e.g. , males - who - have - sex - with - males [ MSM ] ) .By this reckoning , all male - on - male CSA is homosexual molestation , even as all male - on - female CSA is heterosexual molestation .But there is a further important distinction .While psychiatry has defined pedophilia as an exclusive or primary sexual interest in children , in reality very few individuals fit the definition .The vast majority of molesters also have sex with other adults ( often spouses ) or individuals of various ages .This is especially true for perpetrators of homosexual CSA , who often claim to have a homosexual orientation or homosexual desires .Studies of child molesters demonstrate that the perpetrators frequently identify themselves as homosexual or as having homosexual inclinations .In one study where the question was asked directly , 86 % of men who sexually abused boys labeled themselves as bisexual or homosexual .3 Other investigations of groups of convicted child molesters ( including all types of offenders and both boy and girl victims ) reported that the fraction of those who were homosexual or who had \" significant homosexual experiences \" ranged from 22 % to 60 % .The linkage between homosexuality and CSA is also documented in large - scale studies of homosexuals themselves , conducted by gay - sympathetic researchers .The original Kinsey study in 1948 5 found that 28 % of non - delinquent male homosexuals and 20 % of the overall sample of gays admitted to having sex , while adults ( 18 + ) , with boys aged 15 or younger .The Kinsey Research Institute follow - up study in 1970 6 found a similar result : 23 % admitted illegal sex with boys aged 16 or younger when the respondent was at least 21 .Ditto for the 1979 Gay Report survey of over 4,300 male homosexuals , which reported that 22 % admitted to illegal homosexual CSA .In reality , those with homosexual interests tend to be quite sexually flexible , unlike individuals who claim no homosexual desire .8 Other studies have reported that no more than one to five percent of admitted gays claim to have only had sex with other males .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"39.779346"}

{"text":"These two essential conditions are : .Condition 1 : Situations in which males and maleness become a focus of intense interest and emotional arousal .Males and maleness may become a central focus of attention for boys during important developmental years .Intense interest might be created when a boy experiences other boys or men as different , mysterious , or exotic .It might be created when a boy 's normal needs for attachment , attention , affection , strength , or protection from other males are left unmet .And it can arise as a result of various types of abandonment or abuse by other males .All of these situations may cause males and maleness to become and remain a central focus of attention for boys during important developmental years .Most boys experience this type of intense interest in other males during certain years in childhood and adolescence , and do not develop homosexuality .But for some boys , these intense interests are laden with deep emotions , which may feel pleasurable but are more often wistful or painful .These emotions vary , depending on what elicits them .When the intense interest arises from seeing other males as different or exotic , the emotions may include disgust , inferiority , envy , curiosity , wonder , awe , or a compelling urge to emulate .When the interest springs from unmet needs , the emotions may include longing , sadness , and loss .And when the interest is the result of trauma caused by abandonment or abuse , the emotions may include anxiety , fear , anger , hatred , horror , or shame .Condition 2 : Experiences that connect the emotionally laden interest in males and maleness with feelings or impulses that are interpreted by the individual as sexual .The process of connecting sexual feelings to a particular thing is called \" sexualization .\" Extensive research and clinical experience show that humans are capable of sexualizing not only other humans of all types and ages , but also objects and situations .Research and clinical experience show that humans are capable of sexualizing not only other humans of all types and ages , but also objects and situations .Our experience suggests that sexualization goes in the direction of intense emotional interest .The process of sexualization is biologically set to occur during puberty .Under normal circumstances , pubescent children sexualize others of their own age whom they experience - with great interest - as exotic in terms of gender .Most boys sexualize girls .Boys experiencing gender incongruity sexualize other boys .But the sexualization process may be intercepted when intense emotional interest leads a boy 's attention in another direction .For example , if a boy is experiencing unmet needs for attachment , affection , nurture , or protection from other males - whether father , brother , or peers - the intense emotional interests resulting from those needs may be sexualized .If a boy is sexually abused , aspects of the abuse may become sexualized , including traits of the perpetrator , objects involved in the abuse , and the circumstances under which the abuse occurred .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"46.69689"}

'\" [ 5 ] .Though there have always been individuals ( sometimes in a majority , sometimes in a minority ) who were exclusively attracted to those of the opposite sex , heterosexuality as an identity ( just like homosexuality ) has developed only since the middle of the nineteenth century .The history of heterosexuality is part of the history of sexuality .That history and science derivative of it is far from complete .Owing to complications of human politics and prejudice , coupled with the malleable nature of human behaviour , it will be some time before the history and nature of all forms of human sexual behaviour are truly known .The term \" straight \" originated as a mid-20th century gay slang term for heterosexuals , ultimately coming from the phrase \" to go straight \" ( as in \" straight and narrow \" ) , or stop engaging in homosexual sex .[ 3 ] One of the first uses of the word in this way was in 1941 by author G. W. Henry .Henry 's book concerned conversations with homosexual males and used this term in connection with the reference to ex - gays .It currently simply is a colloquial term for \" heterosexual \" having , like many words , changed in primary meaning over time .Those researchers who know most about genes and same sex attraction say \" Your genes did not make you do it \" .Let 's review the evidence bearing in mind that many of the following arguments apply to all human behaviours .These summary statements are much more deeply explored in each chapter .Change .The huge amount of change in sexual orientation is one of the clearest evidences that homosexuality is not hard - wired by genes or anything in the biological environment .Large studies now show that : .For adults : .About half of those with exclusive SSA move towards heterosexuality over a lifetime .Put another way , 3 % of the practising heterosexual population ( both men and women ) claim to have once been either bisexual or homosexual .These changes are not therapeutically induced , but happen \" naturally \" in life , some very quickly .Most changes in sexual orientation are towards exclusive heterosexuality .Numbers of people who have changed towards exclusive OSA are greater than current numbers of bisexuals and exclusive SSA people combined .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"47.3173"}

{"text":"There are contradictions in the paper and the dissertation between the results sections and the discussion sections .A crucial problem is the inability to be certain about when the abuse occurred - before or after awareness of same - sex attraction .In the Archives of Sexual Behavior article , the following statement is made on pages 540 - 541 ( this same statement is identical to her closing discussion in the dissertation ) : .Sixty - eight percent of the present homosexual male participants and 38 % of the present homosexual female participants ( 68 and 36 % , respectively , if including just the homosexual fair participants ) did not identify as homosexual until after the molestation .This suggests that if molestation resulted in homosexuality , this phenomenon occurs in a greater proportion of male homosexuals .It may not , however , be a casual factor in either gender .Perhaps children or adolescents with a higher potential for homosexual behavior are more likely to enter a situation that leads to same - sex molestation .It must also be borne in mind that the present homosexual participants may not be representative of homosexual persons .The overwhelming preponderance of homosexual participants was in the gay pride group .There were only three homosexual men and seven homosexual women in the college group .The clear implication in this discussion section is that the frequency of homosexual identification was a consequence of the abuse .However , in the table which reported the data regarding timing of identification , the authors report the same percentage of males who reported identification as gay before the abuse .Table II on page 538 reports ( click the link for a clearer view ) : .Something is not right here .The numbers for females add up to 100 % but the male numbers are contradictory .If the table is correct , then the case for causation from this study is somewhat compromised .The table indicates that 68 % of men identified as homosexual before their molestation experience .My colleague Gary Welton and I first discovered this discrepancy nearly three years ago while preparing a scholarly article on the effects sizes of various suggested correlates of homosexuality ( one which will be published later this year or early next year ) .At that time , I contacted Donald Templer , one of the co - authors and advisor to first author Marie Tomeo .I then contacted him again recently in preparation for this post .He has been unable to locate Dr. Tomeo to get clarification .I hope Dr. Tomeo can at some point clarify these matters .Recently , I ordered the dissertation to check the original study .However , there are discrepancies in this document as well .First , here are the relevant research questions with results .From page 36 of Marie Tomeo 's dissertation : .The 10th research question addressed , of homosexual women who were molested , what percentage were molested before self - identification as a homosexual woman and what percentage were molested after self - identification as a homosexual woman ?","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"49.12014"}

{"text":"[ 31 ] .The relationship between biology and sexual orientation is a subject of research .Any simple and singular determinant for sexual orientation has not been conclusively demonstrated ; various studies point to different , even conflicting positions , but scientists hypothesize that a combination of genetic , hormonal , and social factors determine sexual orientation .[ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Biological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation are more popular , [ 34 ] and biological factors may involve a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment .[36 ] These factors , which may be related to the development of heterosexual as well as other orientation , include genes , prenatal hormones , and brain structure .The neurobiology of the masculinization of the brain is fairly well understood .Estradiol and testosterone , which is catalyzed by the enzyme 5α - reductase into dihydrotestosterone , act upon androgen receptors in the brain to masculinize it .If there are few androgen receptors ( people with androgen insensitivity syndrome ) or too much androgen ( females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia ) , there can be physical and psychological effects .[38 ] It has been suggested that both male and female heterosexuality are results of variation in this process .[ 39 ] In these studies heterosexuality in females is linked to a lower amount of masculinization than is found in lesbian females , though when dealing with male heterosexuality there are results supporting both higher and lower degrees of masculinization than homosexual males .[41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] .The study of the environment and sexual orientation is research into possible environmental influences on the development of human sexual orientation .Some researchers distinguish environmental influences from hormonal influences , [ 44 ] while others include biological influences such as prenatal hormones as part of environmental influences .[45 ] .At the beginning of the 20th century , early theoretical discussions in the field of psychoanalysis posited original bisexuality in human psychological development .Quantitative studies by Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s and Dr. Fritz Klein 's sexual orientation grid in the 1980s find distributions similar to those postulated by their predecessors .According to Sexual Behavior in the Human Male by Alfred Kinsey and several other modern studies , the majority of humans have had both heterosexual and homosexual experiences or sensations and are bisexual .Kinsey himself , along with current sex therapists , focused on the historicity and fluidity of sexual orientation .Kinsey 's studies consistently found sexual orientation to be something that evolves in many directions over a person 's lifetime ; rarely , but not necessarily , including forming attractions to a new sex .Rarely do individuals radically reorient their sexualities rapidly - and still less do they do so volitionally - but often sexualities expand , shift , and absorb new elements over decades .For example , socially normative \" age - appropriate \" sexuality requires a shifting object of attraction ( especially in the passage through adolescence ) .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"57.303078"}

{"text":"In the same way , nature presents us with sex anatomy spectrums .Breasts , penises , clitorises , scrotums , labia , gonads - all of these vary in size and shape and morphology .So - called \" sex \" chromosomes can vary quite a bit , too .But in human cultures , sex categories get simplified into male , female , and sometimes intersex , in order to simplify social interactions , express what we know and feel , and maintain order .So nature does n't decide where the category of \" male \" ends and the category of \" intersex \" begins , or where the category of \" intersex \" ends and the category of \" female \" begins .Humans decide .Humans ( today , typically doctors ) decide how small a penis has to be , or how unusual a combination of parts has to be , before it counts as intersex .Humans decide whether a person with XXY chromosomes or XY chromosomes and androgen insensitivity will count as intersex .In our work , we find that doctors ' opinions about what should count as \" intersex \" vary substantially .Some think you have to have \" ambiguous genitalia \" to count as intersex , even if your inside is mostly of one sex and your outside is mostly of another .Some think your brain has to be exposed to an unusual mix of hormones prenatally to count as intersex - so that even if you 're born with atypical genitalia , you 're not intersex unless your brain experienced atypical development .And some think you have to have both ovarian and testicular tissue to count as intersex .Rather than trying to play a semantic game that never ends , we at ISNA take a pragmatic approach to the question of who counts as intersex .We work to build a world free of shame , secrecy , and unwanted genital surgeries for anyone born with what someone believes to be non - standard sexual anatomy .By the way , because some forms of intersex signal underlying metabolic concerns , a person who thinks she or he might be intersex should seek a diagnosis and find out if she or he needs professional healthcare .Lesbian is a term most widely used in the English language to describe sexual and romantic desire between females .The word may be used as a noun , to refer to women who identify themselves or who are characterized by others as having the primary attribute of female homosexuality , or as an adjective , to describe characteristics of an object or activity related to female same - sex desire .Lesbian as a concept , used to differentiate women with a shared sexual orientation , is a 20th - century construct .Throughout history , women have not had the freedom or independence to pursue homosexual relationships as men have , but neither have they met the harsh punishment in some societies as homosexual men .Instead , lesbian relationships have often been regarded as harmless and incomparable to heterosexual ones unless the participants attempted to assert privileges traditionally enjoyed by men .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"58.450287"}
{"text":"What study , what anecdotal evidence . \"\" Quackery \" means therapy that is NOT based on science .Thus , there would be no study to \" prove quackery \" rather it is an accusation that the therapy ( RT for example ) is NOT based on science .RT therapy is based on an outdated and unproven model of homosexuality ( i.e. the old Freudian model of the weak / absent father and domineering mother ) .Which is why it and most of the other SOCE therapies fit the criteria for quackery .Teresa .As a woman with same sex attraction ( SSA )I 'm going to be a skunk in the woodpile here .First , we lack precision in definitions .If by ' gay ' we mean same sex sexual behavior ; then , yes , persons can be ex - gay .If , however , gay is simply shorthand for homosexual or same sex attracted ; then , there is less likelihood that someone no longer has same sex attractions or is no longer homosexual ... so , most likely someone is not ' ex ' in the attraction department .Having a period of quiescence in attractions , whether str8 or SSA , is common and should n't be used as an indicator of changing sexual attraction .But , here 's what troubles me in this proposed Bill SB 2278 : .I do n't consider SSA a benign in the area of sexuality .So , I 'm troubled by the bolded part of the above quote .For persons with a faith belief that discourages ( rather a lite verb that is ) same sex sexual behavior , I do n't see a problem with trying ' to reduce ' same sex sexual or romantic feelings toward a person of the same sex .In fact , I would really encourage tools , be they therapy or whatever , in this regard .This Bill , in my opinion , is just too broad in its limitation of access to therapeutic options in the reduction of same sex attractions .Reduction of attractions is not change of orientation .So , what am I missing here ?I know SITF is an alternative therapy for aligning one 's faith belief with sexual activity , but is all SOCE geared simply toward change of orientation ?David Pickup LMFT .It does n't matter if all SOCE is geared toward change of sexual orientation or not because the bill states that all therapies in which the goal / actions are to attempt to reduce or eliminate homosexual feelings are illegal .Tom Van Dyke .Yes , Teresa , I was thinking specifically of your own previous comments at this blog when I commented above .Unfortunately , Christopher Doyle 's stupid argument invoking Jerry Sandusky gets all the attention and condemnation - and this unscientific and bad law gets away scot - free .This is how the game is played . ken .I think you are missing that the part you highlighted are only illegal if they are part of an effort to change a person 's orientation .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"58.45759"}

{"text":"The innate cues satisfy universality conditions : they do not depend on race , ethnicity , culture , or historical period .Root cues that are transmitted by men are different from those transmitted by women .The brains of boys and girls process those cues using the same innate mechanisms .Boys and girls whose innate brains are tuned to root cues transmitted by men will be sexually attracted , at puberty , to men .Boys and girls whose innate brains are tuned to women 's root cues will be sexually attracted , at puberty , to women .The emerging sexual orientation at puberty depends on that actual innate tuning of the boy or the girl .That innate tuning may be genetic or due to sex hormones concentration in early developmental stages .In humans , hearing is the only sense that satisfies the universality conditions .Both the vocal and auditory systems are genetically differentiated between the sexes .Voice is one of the most robust , reliable , universal cues which are used for identifying the sex of a person .In addition , the auditory system shows differentiation along sex and orientation lines .[67 ] [ 68 ] .Currently , most of our knowledge about the underlying causes of sexual orientations is in the form of correlations between physiological features and sexual orientation .The auditory system provides not only correlations , but also feasible explanations of cause - effect relationships between system and mechanisms on one hand , and observed behaviors on the other .More studies are needed , though , to resolve the issue .McFadden et al . examined prenatal androgen exposure and its effects on sex and sexual orientation and how it may play a role in altering some aspects of the auditory structure .Previous animal research has shown that otoacoustic emissions ( OAEs ) become masculinized due to prenatal androgen exposure in late gestation , suggesting that such exposure can affect both sexual orientation and the auditory system .In newborn male infants , OAEs are lower than those of newborn females , and are weaker in nonheterosexual females than in heterosexual females .The masculinization of OAEs in homosexual females may be due to the fact that their cochlear amplifiers becoming weakened during prenatal development due to the exposure of androgens .Auditory evoked potentials ( AEPs ) also exhibit sex differences beginning early in life .Some AEPs are different for heterosexual and nonheterosexual females , and other AEPs are different for heterosexual and nonheterosexual males .Much evidence suggests that the cochlear amplifier system can be prenatally masculinized in mammals as well .If such effects are due to androgen exposure , then basic differences in OAEs and AEPs , at birth as well as young adults , may alter the gene which leads to the global difference in prenatal androgen exposure .This would also suggest that OAE differences in homosexual females are associated with the effects of atypical androgens exposure , which may be the effect of some system which produces either a global or local over - exposure of androgens during a crucial period in prenatal development .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"60.35824"}

{"text":"This pejorative usage has its origins in the late 1970s .Beginning in the 1980s and especially in the late 1990s , the usage as a generic insult became common among young people .By the mid-20th century , gay was well established in reference to hedonistic and uninhibited lifestyles and its antonym straight , which had long had connotations of seriousness , respectability , and conventionality , had now acquired specific connotations of heterosexuality .In the case of gay , other connotations of frivolousness and showiness in dress ( \" gay apparel \" ) led to association with camp and effeminacy .This association no doubt helped the gradual narrowing in scope of the term towards its current dominant meaning , which was at first confined to subcultures .Gay was the preferred term since other terms , such as queer , were felt to be derogatory .Homosexual is perceived as excessively clinical , since the sexual orientation now commonly referred to as \" homosexuality \" was at that time a mental illness diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) .In mid-20th century Britain , where male homosexuality was illegal until the Sexual Offences Act 1967 , to openly identify someone as homosexual was considered very offensive and an accusation of serious criminal activity .Additionally , none of the words describing any aspect of homosexuality were considered suitable for polite society .Consequently , a number of euphemisms were used to hint at suspected homosexuality .Examples include \" sporty \" girls and \" artistic \" boys , all with the stress deliberately on the otherwise completely innocent adjective .The sixties marked the transition in the predominant meaning of the word gay from that of \" carefree \" to the current \" homosexual \" .By 1963 , a new sense of the word gay was known well enough to be used by Albert Ellis in his book The Intelligent Woman 's Guide to Man - Hunting .Tags : .Oh it was !I just hate making typos , especially when they 're titles like that .But that 's exactly my point .You have one person who identifies as sexual , but who requires certain situations and scenarios to become aroused , and you have another person , who identifies as asexual , who can become aroused in certain situations and scenarios .It 's not one person with a kink and another person with specific needs -- it 's two people with specific needs .Is the difference between them really just the choice of self - identification , or is there a deeper difference , do you think ?Okay , let me preface this by saying that I 'm not in the kink community at all , so while I have a working understanding of some issues I 'm not 100 % on these things .If I say anything wrong / offensive I apologize in advance and please let me know and correct me .If you look at it like that , I think the difference lies in the specific issue that their willingness / not is actually hinging on ?","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"60.708107"}

Henry .[11 ] Henry 's book concerned conversations with homosexual males and used this term in connection with the reference to ex - gays .It currently simply is a colloquial term for \" heterosexual \" having , like many words , changed in primary meaning over time .Some object to usage of the term \" straight \" because it implies that non - heteros are crooked .[ 12 ] .Heterosexual symbolism dates back to the earliest artifacts of humanity , with ritual fertility carvings and primitive art .This was later expressed in the symbolism of fertility rites and polytheistic worship , which often included images of human reproductive organs , such as lingam in Hinduism .Modern symbols of heterosexuality in societies derived from European traditions still reference symbols used in these ancient beliefs .One such image is a combination of the symbol for Mars , the Roman god of war , as the definitive male symbol of masculinity , and Venus , the Roman goddess of love and beauty , as the definitive female symbol of femininity .The Judeo - Christian tradition has several scriptures related to heterosexuality .In Genesis 2:24 , there is a commandment stating \" Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh \" ( Gen 2:24 )","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"64.60889"}
