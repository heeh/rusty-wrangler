Jamie Eldridge , D - Acton , the senator requested and received ideas for legislation for the next legislative session last Monday night .Eldridge stated that the filing deadline for legislation is Jan. 18 .Constituents representing seven of the 14 towns in his Middlesex & Worcester Senatorial District asked the senator questions and made suggestions about everything from retiree health benefits to gun control .Acton Selectman Janet Adachi started by asking the senator when the state would be releasing its final report on other post - employment benefits ( OPEB ) .Even though OPEB are not received until after employment has ended , they are a part of the compensation that employees earn each year .That makes it difficult to assess the full cost of public services and the long - term financial health of municipalities .Adachi acknowledged that the state has recognized the need to mitigate the burden of OPEB on municipalities , but wondered if the Governmental Accounting Standards Board would be recommending a mandate in terms of the amount that towns must set aside to pay in to the benefits .She suggested that a long - term bond would provide a source of funding for cities and towns .Eldridge said there would be no mandate , and agreed with Adachi that the state has an excellent bond rating .Many towns are starting to set aside funds toward retiree health benefits , but in Acton , for example , the amount set aside is only about $ 500,000 , according to Harvard resident Paul Green .Massachusetts towns are still awaiting the recommendations of the special commission created by the 2011 pension reform act on how towns might pay for retiree health benefits .Green , a member of the Devens Economic Analysis Team , added , \" The sooner these numbers are calculated and published , the better .We would like guidance from the state . \" Education issues .One citizen raised a question about the per - pupil dollar amount of the state incentive to regionalize school districts , as Acton is looking to expand its regionalization with Boxborough .The question asked was if that amount might be increased to $ 100 per student .The current amount of bonus aid from the state is $ 50 per student in the first year , which would decline by $ 10 per student per year for five years , according to Eldridge .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.961945"}

Gilmore on the grounds that the decision of whether to offer sex education should be left to local school boards .According to dozens of sexuality education proponents interviewed for this report during the latter half of 1997 and in early 1998 , the push for abstinence - only education is only the most visible element of a larger conservative strategy to eliminate more comprehensive programs .Other proposals include eliminating coeducational classes and changing the parental consent process in ways that sex education proponents warn could make participation in sex education more complicated for students and costly for schools .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.995895"}

Barry Finegold , who supported the bill after sharing success stories of charter schools in Lawrence .In successive actions , the Senate rejected on a 13 - 26 vote Chang - Diaz 's proposal that had moved through the Senate Ways and Means Committee as an amendment .The Senate proceeded in a separate 9 - 30 vote to also defeat the underlying bill that had cleared the House .Unions , meanwhile , cheered the bill 's defeat .\" We congratulate the Senate for taking a stand for public schools and for public school students , many of whom live in poverty and who need all the resources they can get .The vote against raising the cap keeps resources in our locally controlled public schools where they are most needed , \" said Tom Gosnell , president of American Federation of Teachers - Massachusetts .Republican gubernatorial candidate Charles Baker issued a statement suggesting the Senate \" bowed to political pressure and handed urban families stuck in struggling schools a massive defeat by shutting down access to high performing schools .\" Chang - Diaz introduced the bill for debate with a speech that riffed off of President Obama 's famous \" Yes , we can \" slogan imploring her colleagues to shake the polarizing rhetoric that has come to define many past debates on the merits of charter schools .Chang - Diaz said she believes there is a way to balance the interests of both sides on the issue , but suggested she would need to \" reflect \" on why her proposal fell short .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"97.10527"}

{"text":"Asha .Sex education should be discussed at 5th and 6th grades so they do n't get scared when puberty does happen if the parents are n't open about it .We should also carry it out to add on more and more each year so then teens know the risk of having sex at the age they are before committed into more .They should n't start in kindergarten because the kids wo nt know what they 're talking about .We should keep it the same and be available to teens along with open parents .Amjid KW .I think that a good place to start teaching sex ed is at puberty and you should start being thought in 6th grade .6th grade is a good place to start teaching you about puberty because then you are prepared for the changes your body is going through and how you can handle your emotions .kids should start learning about how your body works and sex ed at 7th or 8th grade because you need to be mature enough to take what your teacher is talking about seriously and be able to comprehend it .George F. .I think that sex - ed is taught at an good time right now at 4 - 5th grade because that 's when kids are to start maturing .With puberty varying in time for person to person it would be best to teach them at home when their parents think their child is starting puberty .In school when they teach it the kids because they are young will mess around and wo n't take it seriously around their friends while at home they are more private .If you teach it too early the kids will not understand it and then it could lead to more issues at a younger age .Swapnik K. .I think sex ed should be taught when the kid 's parents think they are ready .Some children mature faster than others , and the parents know them best .Most kids would probably learn it around 4th or 5th grade and some would learn it later on when their parents think they 're ready .It woulds also make it less awkward for the children learning it from their parents instead of a stranger .The parents could also choose to let the school teach it if they are not comfortable doing it . justin .I think that sex education is okay at the time that it was already taught at , around fifth grade .On the other hand , slightly simplified topics could also be taught at an earlier time , around third to fourth grade , but any earlier than that could be useless , as children may not be as concentrated at the time .I also feel that having sex education at kindergarten to second grade is far too early .Additionally , we can not ignore the parents in such situations , as if a child does enter puberty prematurely , the parents are also somewhat responsible in teaching them .TA^2 .I believe that sex education should continue to be taught at the grade levels it is currently being taught at .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"97.92246"}

{"text":"Thanks very much , and without further ado , let me hand it over to Nancy .NANCY NORTHUP : Thank you , David , and good morning .New Hampshire can do that .Indeed , as David said , there are 35 states now - some of the state statutes have been enjoined - where such laws , either requiring minors to get their parent 's consent or to notify a parent about an abortion , are in effect .So that has been true since Roe v. Wade was decided and states started passing such laws requiring either parental consent or notification .The court has been looking at these cases since 1976 .It has looked at them one way or the other about 10 times .So New Hampshire had guideposts on how to set up a constitutional parental notification law .What is at issue tomorrow is the fact that New Hampshire did not do that .They can go to court and talk to a judge about it , show that they 're mature , and that they can make this decision , or that otherwise the decision to terminate their pregnancy is in their best interests .And in this case , it 's undisputed in the record that teenagers , like women in general , have medical emergencies that come up in connection with pregnancies , and some of those are emergencies that could cause permanent and severe harm to their health .Just a few : preeclampsia ; a type of pregnancy - induced hypertension that can be very dangerous to a pregnant woman ; severe infection of the placental lining , pelvic infections related to pregnancy ; heavy bleeding from the uterus .If these types of conditions do not receive immediate medical attention - not the time to get a lawyer and go to court and talk to the judge , but immediate medical attention - can cause damage to major organs , particularly the liver and the kidneys .They can cause , at times , the spread of infection , loss of vision , permanent loss of fertility and chronic pain .What New Hampshire failed to do here is make sure that minors who are in such emergencies - and are they going to be most minors in the state of New Hampshire ?No .Most minors in New Hampshire are going to be able to comply with what the law says .They are going to tell their mom or dad , or they are going to go to court and talk to a judge about why , in their family situation , that 's not appropriate for them , but that they are mature enough to make this decision .In an emergency situation , however , a woman needs to go to a doctor , not to the courthouse .This case reminds us , and I think it 's important for that reason too , that pregnancy is a major physical and medical event in a woman 's life .Sometimes , with all this debate around the constitutionality of abortion and questions about abortion rights and the religious debates about abortion , we forget that it is a major medical event .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"98.28085"}

Bush to serve on the United States Delegation to the United Nations ' Special Session on Children in 2001 .In 1999 , Bill founded Sudan Relief and Rescue , Inc. to aid persecuted Christians in Sudan .He is a graduate of Harvard Law School .If you have not already done so , please take a copy of the new legal backgrounder on the Ayotte case that the Pew Forum has issued today .The backgrounder gives the reader a brief overview of the important abortion cases , from Roe through Stenberg , and then discusses in detail the issues before the court in Ayotte .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"98.70549"}

{"text":"amanda sauvie .I completely agree .I remember the young girls who got picked on because they developed before the other girls .I personally think that as it is an uncomfortable topic for most to discuss , that sex education should not be a class especially at such a young age .I think parents have a right to tell their child this information rather than schools telling their children without taking permission from the parents .Juwan .I think they are teaching it too slow now what about the kids who have older siblings who talk about it and the younger sibling start to think its wise to go and act on it out of curiosity .There are a lot of people who start puberty early like me who get very curious about the opposite sex and lots of people act on that curiosity .So instead of doing something stupid to find out the difference when they could just be taught at a earlier age .t'ohno'pain .i think that teaching this at 5th grade is just the right time for them to start teaching this .i think this way because i was taught this around 6th grade and it was at the right time .but now that kids are hitting puberty earlier maybe we should move it back a year or so .the average age now for a boy hitting puberty now is around 10 ( as explained on the link ) .so at that age i think around 5th grade would be the right time to be teaching this .but it is also the parents responsibility to talk and get engaged with there kids about this . its a big time in there life 's .so that is my opinion on this .Children now days are starting puberty too early .These days \" the norm \" is considered to be around 7 - 8 .i remember when 11 - 13 years old was normal .This is called precocious puberty .When children start puberty too early it does n't give their recipients of the early start time to grow into their body 's which will spark health problems when they are older .This condition may include social stresses to come with the early start as well .Samantha_M .I believe sex education should be taught at a much younger age .Young girls and boys are developing a lot faster than they used to .Girls and Boys body 's are developing , in many ways , such as growing taller and growing in other areas , getting armpit hair and needing deodorant .They need to know how to take care of their bodies since they are growing faster .Schools not teaching sex education at an earlier age , make parents have to talk about what s going on with their kids bodies .Some people have parents that wo nt talk to their kid about it , so how are they supposed to know what s going on with their bodies ?We need sex education to start sooner so kids can start getting informed and they do n't have to worry if they are normal or not .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"99.41464"}

{"text":"But state Senator Tim Keller , D - Albuquerque , says he 's drafting a bill that would allow parents and/or school districts to opt students out of the tests without penalty .\" Frankly , this is all heading toward legal battle unless the legislature steps in and deals with it , \" Keller said .\" Testing has become testing for the sake of testing as opposed to creating better students .That 's something we have to be careful with .We have to be sure there are large amounts of the school day left for all kinds of educational purposes other than teaching to the test .I think we 've gone too far at this point . \"Keller hopes the bill would give parents and school administrators options about what he calls \" over - testing \" in New Mexico .But Keller likely faces an uphill battle .Gov. Susana Republic strongly supports the standardized tests and would likely veto a bill that would destroy her attempts at education reform .\" The fact that this has become such an issue in our state speaks exactly why we need to consider this and solve the problem , \" Keller said .The testing is controversial among educators in large part because the tests do n't count as part of a student 's grade .Instead , it 's intended to measure a teacher 's achievement and classroom progress .Opening day of the 2014 NM Legislative Session is Jan. 25 , 2014 .Save Gay Straight Alliances in Tennessee Schools .How do you take a good piece of legislation and turn it into an administrative nightmare ?Well it is happening right now to SB0426 here in Tennessee .The bill originally allowed parents to opt their child out of participation in a school club or organization .Now Sen. Stacey Campfield has filed an amendment to this bill that would change the requirement .If the parents want their child to participate in a school club , they have to give written permission for them to participate .While this sounds like another way of doing the same thing , it is not .Opting your child out of one club with a note is not the same thing as having to give written permission for every club your child may participate in .Asking our already overburdened school administrators to sort through hundreds of permission slips every year and police which clubs the students can attend will create unnecessary paperwork , consume too much time , and place yet another level of bureaucracy on schools activites .Amendment 1 to SB0426 will not only create an undue burden on parents and schools .Such legislation has also been used in other states to eliminate Gay Straight Alliances from high school campuses .Students who attend schools with Gay Straight Alliances are less likely to experience anti - LGBT hostility and harassment on campus .Tell the Tennessee State Senate 's Education Committee to vote \" No \" on Amendment 1 to SB0426 .Then recruit your friends to participate in this petition by email , Facebook and Twitter !","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"99.53486"}
{"text":"Since the subject of the legislation is parental notification for a minor 's abortion , the fact is that the government should not have a role either pro or con on this point .It is not up to the left to impose their views nor on the right to insist on their view either .It is the right of the individual to make up their own mind .The Constitution lists only a handful of crimes .Traditionally , states had a relatively small list of criminal acts .The operative issue is that no one should initiate force against another ( but if force is initiated , then an individual may defend themselves ) .Today , both the left and the right have imposed tens of thousands of laws and regulations at the state and Federal level .Any prosecutor , should he or she so decide , can easily prosecute anyone - because every day every one of us violates many laws and regulations - mostly ones we never even heard of .The culture war is a loser for the right - because most of it does not belong in the realm of government .And the worst case is that often the right sets the precedent that might allow the left to do just the opposite .For example , if you make a law that prohibits abortion - many on the right might then cheer - but that establishes that government has a legitimate interest in the very personal decisions people make about reproduction and the use of their own bodies .Then , at some future date , the left might establish a \" one child policy \" ( as China has had for some time ) - thus requiring that the state perform abortions on those who violate the one - child policy .It is much better that the government never be given any authority at all in reproductive decisions by individuals .The less the government is involved in our daily lives the better off we are .Martin , you commend ' Friend ' for being understanding and insightful , but his is certainly not a conservative viewpoint .Following your effusive praise of ' Friend ' , you throw rocks at Lew who makes an even more insightful and understanding argument than does ' Friend ' .Ever consider that just maybe you 're an OWL , unable to see through your political blinders ?The nature of children is that they really are children - they are unequipped to make major life decisions like having an abortion .Why should we be forced to allow the government to usurp our parental rights for the few instances where there is such an unhealthy parent - child relationship that the child would be put in danger if they approached their parent with news of a pregnancy ?Why are we to be prevented from protecting our children ?You may be correct that the consequences of dealing with upset parents can have an impact on children far into adulthood , but the consequences of an abortion have far greater consequences and last far longer than you can imagine .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"99.55702"}

{"text":"Results from this study are published in the April issue of Journal of School Health .Christine Markham , Ph.D. , assistant professor of behavioral science at the UT School of Public Health , and colleagues examined sexual risk behaviors among middle school students in a large southeastern U.S. urban public school district .\" This is one of the few school - based studies conducted with this age group to look at specific sexual practices in order to develop more effective prevention programs , \" Markham said .\" This study shows that although most seventh graders are not engaging in sexual risk behaviors , a small percentage are putting themselves at risk . \" In the study , Markham and colleagues defined sexual intercourse as vaginal , oral or anal sex .According to their research , by age 12 , 12 percent of students had already engaged in vaginal sex , 7.9 percent in oral sex , 6.5 percent in anal sex and 4 percent in all three types of intercourse .The study found one - third of sexually active students reported engaging in vaginal or anal sex without a condom within the past three months , and one - fourth had four or more partners .The more experienced students in all three types of intercourse were more likely to be male and African - American .\" We need to develop prevention programs that address the needs of students who are not yet sexually active in order to promote skills and attitudes to help them wait until they are older to have sex , \" Markham said .\" And we need to provide skills and knowledge related to condoms and contraception for youth who are already sexually active . \"The study recommends that sexually active students also need to receive accurate and factual information and services related to STDs and pregnancy testing , as well as skills for future abstention and risk reduction for those who intend to remain sexually active .More than one - third of youth in the study reported engaging in precoital touching behaviors .Among the students who engaged in precoital behavior , 43 percent reported having engaged in sexual intercourse .According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , 80 percent of the 435,427 births to mothers ages 15 to 19 were the result of unintended pregnancies .According to the National Vital Statistics Report , birth rates among Hispanic and black teens remain higher than other racial / ethnic groups , including rates among those ages 10 to 14 .In 2000 , youth between the ages of 15 and 24 accounted for 9.1 million or 48 percent of all new STD cases , according to a report by the CDC .Minority youth also are disproportionately affected .The CDC 's 2006 STD Surveillance Report stated that minority racial and ethnic populations had higher rates of STDs when compared to whites and , although black teens represent only 17 percent of U.S. teenagers , they account for 70 percent of HIV / AIDS cases reported among teens .\" We need more research to develop effective interventions , in particular for youth of color living in underserved areas , \" Markham said .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"99.83255"}

Alice Peisch that allows more charter schools without addressing increases in reimbursements to traditional public schools that some lawmakers and advocates have demanded .Peisch said the new bill contains many of elements that were being considered by the committee , but is silent on reimbursement funding .The bill contains increased flexibility for certain underperforming school districts and a \" modest \" enrollment cap increase for charter schools in the lowest performing districts .The House vote effectively moves the issue out of the Education Committee , which was unable to agree on a bill after months of talks and in the face of a biennial reporting deadline .The Peisch bill is now being considered by the House Ways and Means Committee .Peisch informed Sen. Sonia Chang - Diaz , the Senate Education Committee co - chair , that she was filing her own version of the bill , known as act to improve student achievement .\" The subject matter of this bill , I think was too important , to die by using procedural rules and not allowing the bill to advance so there could be a full debate in the Legislature , \" Peisch told the News Service Wednesday .Over the weekend Chang - Diaz and Rep. Russell Holmes ( D - Boston ) offered a plan that would have tied annual increases in the cap to full reimbursement to local school districts that lose students to charter schools .Peisch and the Race to the Top Coalition , a group that has pushed for charter school expansion , opposed linking the enrollment cap to reimbursement , an idea Chang - Diaz promoted as a compromise .Peisch said her plan could enable the issue to reach the floors of the House and Senate .\" This does give an opportunity for the bill to be taken up in the Senate if and when it goes through the House , \" she said .Speaker DeLeo has said he was hopeful for action on the issue this session .After the committee was unable to reach a compromise in time to meet the Tuesday evening deadline , Chang - Diaz released a statement saying she was \" sad that obstinacy and polarized rhetoric stood in the way of compromise and progress . \"","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"100.44818"}

{"text":"Advisory committees have the additional advantage of encouraging parents to become more involved in the development and implementation of sexuality education courses .In contrast , merely giving parents the option of taking their children out of sexuality education classes provides no such opportunities for parents ' active engagement .Jerald Newberry , executive director of the National Health Information Network at the National Education Association and former head of family life education in Fairfax County , Virginia , observes , \" [ An opt - out program ] does n't make parents more comfortable and knowledgeable .\" Newberry and others suggest that teachers hold information sessions early in the school year to give parents an opportunity to learn about the curriculum and to review materials that will be used in the course .In a novel approach to this issue , Washington State permits parents to remove their child from mandated AIDS education classes , but only after the parents have attended a program offered by the school district on weekends and evenings to review the curriculum and to meet the teacher .On a broader level , sex education advocates believe that continuing to make the case for comprehensive programs is critical .\" Our message , \" declares Planned Parenthood 's McGee , \" has to be that it is immoral to deprive people of information that can save lives and promote health .Just say no ' campaigns clearly do not provide such information . \"Despite the current momentum of the abstinence - only movement , there is reason for optimism that more comprehensive programs will prevail .In several California communities , for example , parents and teachers have successfully opposed efforts by conservative , anti - sex - education school board members to implement an abstinence - only curricula or otherwise undermine sex education .In Hemet , for example , the school board was forced to back down from its abstinence - only approach to AIDS education after parents and teachers sued the school system .Similarly , parent protests stopped the school board in Ventura County from proceeding with its plan to bar HIV - instruction training for teachers .\" There was a huge backlash , \" reports Superintendent Charles Weis .\" It was like awakening a sleeping giant .\" The defeat of conservative incumbents \" sent a clear message to the extreme right that they could not fulfill their agenda and stay on the school board . \"( See : reference 36 . )Some researchers , including Kirby , believe that there is insufficient data available to make a conclusive judgment about the impact of abstinence - only curricula .One recent study did find that teenagers who participated in an abstinence program were less likely than a control group to report having intercourse in the three months following the intervention ; however , the effect had disappeared at the six- and 12-month follow - up .( Source : Jemmott JB 3rd , Jemmott LS and Fong GT , Abstinence and safer sex HIV risk - reduction interventions for African American adolescents , Journal of the American Medical Association , 1998 , 279(19):1529 - 1536 . )","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"100.664154"}

{"text":"Lastly , there is NO sex ed in high school ( at least in my town ) , so I am very grateful my kids got a good education before hitting the intense part of their teens .Even though I was surprised by the content , in the end , I wrote a note to the science teacher thanking her for heading up the program , precisely b / c it is n't taught in high school .As the parent of a teen who is young for her age , I understand your concern .A couple of thoughts : .First , I do n't think you can compare not being developmentally ready for algebra with not being developmentally ready for sex ed .True - within 6th grade kids can be at very different developmentally stages , and it sounds like your daughter is at one end .However , that is not really the point .You do n't have kids who are n't ready for algebra seeking it out regardless ( but you sure do for kids seeking out sex whether they are ready or not ! ) , and the consequences are not the same .My opinion is that talking about sex , sexual decision - making , etc . is best started before they are into the throes of hormones , etc .That is when you want them to already HAVE the info and be comfortable with it .The more matter - of - fact it can be the better , and that is easier done when they 're a bit younger and it 's not so much an ' ' issue ' ' yet .Will your daughter be exposed to topics and other kids ' experiences that she does n't know about , and you think she does n't need to know about yet ?Probably .That 's not necessarily a bad thing , because it 's a safe environment , there will be an adult response , and you have a ready - made ' ' in ' ' to discuss the topics yourself with her .I 'm a strong believer of taking advantages of these openings whenever you can , because the opportunities come up less and less as they get older .How comfortable are you with the way programs like this are planned at your daughter 's school ?Who are the staff involved ?I would talk to the counselor , or whoever else you have a relationship with , to get more specifics .Hopefully they already know your kid and can understand why you have the concerns you do , but even if not , they 're aware that or the developmental range at this age and hopefully have thought of how this will be taken into account .Will there be follow - up ?Will there be school staff present as well ?( I would guess this is a requirement . )Who can you talk to afterward if you have a concern ?You could also talk with someone at the program to find out specifics - even though the brochure and pr are focused on pregnancy prevention , I would guess that is not the only- or even central- message .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"102.36789"}

{"text":"NateDawg .I believe that sexual education should be taught in two stages .Studies show that kids as young as 6 begin experiencing puberty ; girls can even begin to have their period at this age .This is why the first \" stage \" of sex - ed should be taught in 1st grade , and be tailored to fit the physical maturity level of the kids in that age group .This first stage would include information about body hair growth , periods , and developing feelings towards the opposite gender .Despite contrary belief , teaching sexual education at a younger age does n't actually cause kids to have sex at a younger age , but rather prevents ignorance and delays sexual conduct .The second \" stage \" should be taught in 5th grade , and include a more traditional curriculum .This stage would cover topics such as sexual organs , sexual feelings , and sexual activity . andrewbeyer .I believe that sex ed needs to be taught in 4thor 5th grade because by 6th grade kids are well into puberty and they need information sooner than they are teaching it now .I kind of agree with what you 're saying , but is teaching sex ed to children that do not have mature enough minds okay ?At a young age , kids are more likely to try different things and be more like an adult .If young children learn about sex ed at an early age , they would be more influenced or tempted to have sexual intercourse .Their minds are n't aged enough to understand the consequences that might happen to them during and after sex , even though they might feel uncomfortable discussing this .I think 5th grade is a good time to introduce sex ed because they are not too young or too old to understand about this .I think the age that they are starting Sex Ed . in the schools where I live is the perfect age .Its briefly touched on in fourth , but more in depth during fifth and sixth grade .Even so some kids may hit puberty at a much earlier age , but I feel if this does happen it should lie on the parents to be the ones to teach the child about what s going on with their body .Precocious puberty which is when puberty occurs before the average times for both genders is something that should be left to the parents as it could have negative effects on the child 's overall health ( mental and physical ) and therefore should be kept in privacy .Nick visconti .I think that sex education should be taught by a parent at home in a more comfortable environment than that of a school .Kids may be distracted or more inclined to Not take education seriously around their friends .Also , I believe that sex education should begin much earlier at home and it can be supplemented with more learning at school when a kid is older .To begin around the 5th grade would be ideal in my opinion .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"102.437294"}

Cushing , the prime sponsor , also used a little - known legislative rule to gather official sponsorship of an additional 104 Representatives .At the January 16 public hearing , committee members heard from Phil McLaughlin and Greg Smith , both of whom who had supported the death penalty during their terms as NH Attorneys General .\" Through most of my life I favored capital punishment and the death penalty , \" McLaughlin testified .Noting that the last execution in New Hampshire was in 1939 , he said that it would be at least 75 years and 1000 murders before the State conducts another execution .\" It will not be seen as fair by history , \" he observed .Other speakers included former judges , former law enforcement and corrections officers , the two bishops and other faith leaders , several murder victim family members , and legislators from both political parties .When the hearing was done , 31 people had testified in favor of HB 1170 compared to only 3 who spoke in opposition .The committee followed up the hearing with its own debate on February 11 .There , veteran Representatives Steve Shurtleff , Laura Pantelakos , Robbie Parsons , and Dennis Fields announced they had changed their views and would vote for repeal .When the speeches were done the committee voted 11 to 3 to support the repeal bill , with a majority of both Democrats and Republican members aligned against the death penalty and with no one willing to write a minority opinion .With such strong , bi - partisan support from the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee expectations were high for the House vote on March 12 .But it would have been hard to predict that Representatives would vote 225 to 104 , more than a 2-to-1 margin , to send the repeal bill on to the Senate .Coalition leaders always saw the Senate as a tougher arena .Again repeal supporters showed up in large numbers for an April 3 public hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , and once again the hearing had to be moved to Representatives Hall .Pro - repeal speakers were joined by two prominent retired judges , John Broderick , former Chief Justice of the NH Supreme Court , and Walter Murphy , former Chief Justice of the NH Superior Court .\" There is simply no valid reason for a civilized society to condone the systematic killing human beings , \" Justice Broderick wrote in a NH Union Leader op - ed co - authored by Joseph Nadeau , another retired Supreme Court Justice .But in contrast to the House hearing , Senator Sharon Carson , Chair of the Judiciary Committee , pushed back with questions about the impact of repeal on the case of Michael Addison .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"102.537315"}

{"text":"The risk is even higher for runaway and homeless youths who engage in sex work and drug use .One of the benefits of female - condom use -- besides its protection against STDs , including HIV , during anal and vaginal sex -- is that it empowers receptive sexual partners to protect themselves whether or not their partner wants to use a traditional condom .Young people are told , \" Here 's a male condom , put it on , \" Gordon explains .\" That is their only protection . \" Many of the members of the group had heard of the female condom but did n't know what one looked like , what its capacities were , or that it could be used in the anus .The female condom works by collecting semen , just like a traditional condom ; but instead of covering the penis , it 's inserted into the vagina or anus .For more comfort during anal intercourse , the small inner ring is removed .This also reduces the risk of rectal trauma and bleeding .The outer ring rests outside the anus , providing an additional barrier against STDs transmitted through skin - to - skin contact .The female condom , while in its infancy compared with the 400-year - old male version , has existed for almost 20 years .New York , one of a handful of major cities that distribute female condoms , has been handing them out since 1997 .Today its health department issues nearly a million annually .Yet it 's no accident that there still is n't widespread knowledge of the female condom 's effectiveness during anal sex .Female condoms are n't marketed to either women or men for use in anal sex because it 's illegal to do so ; yet research shows that unprotected anal sex with an HIV - positive partner carries an even higher risk of transmission than does unprotected vaginal sex .Yet the health department 's counselors and spokespeople do not shy away from talking about them .\" We say that female condoms are good for anal sex \" and \" promote their use widely , \" but the department does n't put it in writing , Dr. Sweeney says .\" It 's a way to get the message out there without breaking the law . \"Although many believe the FDA , which approves specific condom uses , tests for efficacy and safety , in reality the agency is merely an oversight committee that depends on manufacturers , research institutions and health organizations to submit empirical data supporting a product 's use .From there , the agency begins its approval process .That 's where Norman Candelario , a research coordinator for community health at the Gay Men 's Health Crisis ( GMHC ) , comes in .Candelario facilitated data collection for a soon - to - be - released study on the female condom and anal sex .\" We learned that the female condom should be part of MSM 's safer - sex menu .We hope to create protocols on how female condoms can be incorporated into the HIV - prevention arena , \" Candelario says .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"102.79078"}

Dan Branch , R - Dallas , said the bill would require recitation of pledges to both the U.S. and Texas flags , and a moment of silence to pray , meditate or reflect at the beginning of each school day .The legislation would replace the current Texas law , which gives school districts the option of holding a period of silence and reciting the pledge .There was little debate on the bill , which had 90 co - authors in the House and passed on a voice vote .Unless their parents submitted a written objection , students , regardless of citizenship status , would be required to participate in the pledges and moment of silence .However , the bill provides no penalties for students who fail to do so .Opponents say the bill would take away First Amendment rights from schoolchildren who may want to excuse themselves from the pledges or minute of silence .But supporters argue that the bill has the opt - out provision .Branch said the bill would have a positive impact on the state 's more than 4 million schoolchildren by emphasizing patriotism .\" This freedom is symbolized in this minute of silence where our children , with the encouragement of their parents , can focus on whatever they deem important as they start the school day , \" Branch said .Wentworth has said it is important for students to show respect by reciting the pledges .\" I believe it is a citizen 's responsibility , especially in the greatest nation on Earth ... that we train our young students to be loyal to our country , \" Wentworth said .The Houston Independent School District and most Houston - area districts direct principals to determine whether their students recite the pledges and observe a minute of silence .Rep.

{"text":"Although the female condom is made of polyurethane plastic ( not latex ) , it requires no special storage .It can be inserted quite a while before having sex , it does not require immediate withdrawal after ejaculation and it can be used with both oil - based and water - based lubricants .Because the external ring is usually visible during sex , a woman can not easily use a female condom without her partner knowing about it , but women do have more control over use of this method than they do over the use of a male condom .Because it can be inserted hours before sexual intercourse , it can provide protection in situations where consumption of alcohol or drugs may reduce the chances that a male condom will be used .The female condom also provides protection during menstruation .The female condom provides extra protection to men and woman because it covers both the entrance to the vagina and the base of the penis , both of which are areas where STD sores make it easy for HIV to enter .How to use the female condom The following instructions should be presented on how to insert the female condom : .Before using the female condom , rub it between your fingers in order to spread the lubrication evenly around .Twist the inner ring into a figure-8 shape and hold between your fingers , or just squeeze the inner ring .The vagina must be relaxed when you insert the condom .Squat or sit with your knees apart , or stand with one leg raised .Push the inner ring into your vagina with your fingers ( use the same insertion method you use to insert a tampon ) , and be careful to ensure that your fingernails or jewellery do not damage the polyurethane .Put your index finger in the condom and gently push the inner ring up into the vagina as far as it will go .The condom should fit snugly against the cervix ( behind the pubic bone ) .It is in the right place if you do n't feel it .The outer ring should hang outside the vagina , and it should not be twisted .During intercourse it is necessary to guide the penis into the condom and to check that the penis has not entered the vagina outside the condom wall .Make sure that the condom is not pushed into the vagina by the penis .If there is a problem ( e.g. if the condom rips or tears , if the outer ring is pushed inside or if the condom bundles up inside the vagina ) , remove the condom and insert a new one .Do n't ever use a male condom at the same time as the female condom because the friction between them will move both condoms out of their proper positions .Remove the condom after male ejaculation by squeezing and twisting the outer ring and gently pulling the condom out of the vagina .Remove the condom before standing up .Wrap the condom in tissue paper and dispose of it in a rubbish bin and not in the toilet .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"105.38757"}

{"text":"While these data were self - reported , they do point to an overarching trend , one in which people falsely believe that oral sex will protect them from acquiring STDs .HIV , however , can indeed be transmitted orally , as the virus can be found in blood , vaginal fluids , seminal fluids , and pre - ejaculate .According to the researchers at the University of Maryland , .Cells in the mucous lining of the mouth may carry HIV into the lymph nodes or the bloodstream .Also , blood from the mouth may enter the urethra , the vagina , the anus , or directly into the body through small cuts or open sores .Researchers have found that the majority of sexually active adolescents do n't use barrier methods , such as condoms , for oral sex .STDs , however , can be transmitted orally .One study carried out by researchers at Yale University found that 70 percent of adolescents who reported engaging in oral sex had never used a barrier to protect themselves from STDs during oral sex - and only 17 percent reported using barriers every time .The same study found that only 9 percent never used protection during vaginal intercourse , and 61 percent reported using protection every time .These lopsided data indicate that there seems to be a prevailing view among young people that oral sex is low - risk or even risk - free , though they still recognize the importance of using barrier methods for vaginal intercourse .This study found no difference in STD rates among pledgers versus nonpledgers , and this may be due to pledgers ' propensity toward unprotected oral sex as well as a greater reluctance to use barrier methods even after starting to engage in vaginal intercourse .Pledgers were also found to be less likely to be screened for STDs .It is possible that many adolescents have been conditioned to think of oral sex as not \" real \" sex .Especially within a heterosexual context , sexually active people might be more likely to regard vaginal intercourse as \" real \" sex , with other activities ranking lower .Additionally , abstinence - only - until - marriage programs , intentionally or not , seem to be correlated with the idea among students that one 's virginity can be \" preserved \" by having oral or anal sex in lieu of vaginal intercourse .Because these programs are not likely to provide students with accurate information about barrier methods , those who engage in oral or anal sex to preserve their virginity are less likely to use condoms or dental dams .These attitudes - that oral sex is not \" real \" sex and is therefore less risky , along with ignorance regarding STD transmission and methods of prevention - give rise to higher STD transmission rates among the sexually active population .It is important that sexually active people are able to know and evaluate the risks inherent to sexual activity , but when the belief that oral sex is \" low - risk \" persists , they can not make decisions based on accurate information .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"106.48685"}

{"text":"You lose personal and professional days and [ often ] have to pay for a substitute . \"In addition , say sexuality education proponents , most teachers tend to use what training opportunities are available for other subjects .\" Teachers need ongoing staff development , \" observes Greene of the National School Boards Association .\" But local school district funds for staff development are very scarce .They ca n't even prepare teachers to use computers , and teachers are more motivated to use technology than to be skilled sexuality educators .\" There appears to be more opportunity for in - service training on HIV prevention than on other sex education topics , thanks to the CDC program .In the 1994 survey of health education teachers , nearly a third of middle school and senior high school teachers reported receiving in - service training on HIV prevention during the two years preceding the survey .40In contrast , about 16 % reported receiving training on STD prevention , and just 6 % said they received training on pregnancy prevention - the lowest proportion of any of the health topics examined .CLASSROOM CONSEQUENCES .The perception among teachers that they lack support for their work - as well as their lack of training - affects what happens in the classroom , sex education proponents report .Even when the school system itself places no restrictions on the subjects covered , teachers limit their discussion of controversial topics , according to several people interviewed for this article , including the retired teachers .This occurs despite the fact that the vast majority of teachers believe that it is important for students to get information about birth control , AIDS and other STDs , sexual decision - making and homosexuality , as well as abstinence .41 \" Unless they have seniority and some moxie , teachers are very reluctant to discuss controversial issues , \" observes Judith McCoy , vice president for education , training and counseling at Planned Parenthood in Seattle .Supporters of comprehensive sexuality education report that increasingly , teachers limit their lessons to \" safe \" topics such as anatomy and abstinence .In addition , some say , sex is often linked with illegal drugs , disease and death .The message many students are getting , says former sexuality education teacher Diane Burger of Pennsylvania , \" is that sex is bad for your body and dangerous .\"Restrictions on sex education funded under the new federal abstinence - only program may exacerbate these trends , even if states do not use the funding to support classroom programs .( States plan to use their funds to support media campaigns , public education efforts , mentoring and counseling activities and curriculum development in addition to school - based programs . )Even money given to schools exclusively for after - school programs may have a chilling effect , says Daniel Daley , director of public policy at SIECUS , because it may give teachers the impression that this is all they may teach .Teachers ' tendency to avoid trouble by limiting their coverage of sexuality topics may be heightened by the fact that in most cases , sexuality education accounts for only a small part of their teaching responsibilities - overall , less than 10 % of their time .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"107.37332"}

{"text":"Furthermore , homeschooling also offers the child a more limited , yet at the same time a more expanded pool of behaviors to observe .Since the child 's \" class \" is his family , he is ( ideally ) not exposed to as many of the undesirable behaviors he might have observed in a public school classroom and is therefore not given as much opportunity to emulate those undesirable behaviors .Alternatively , a homeschooled child is often introduced to a wide range of behaviors through field trips , homeschool support groups , and other outside activities .This interaction with adults and children both older and younger than himself which gives him the opportunity to observe and interact with a wide variety of people , not just children his own age as occurs in a public school classroom setting .While this may mean he is sometimes exposed to behaviors that are undesirable , the parents are often available to offer immediate feedback and to discuss the situation .As a minor example , my own children participated in a homeschool group this last year , and it happened every week that the younger kids ( 5 - 10 ) were playing with the older kids ( 10 - 14 ) and interacting just fine .There were n't any stigmas that the older kids could n't associate with the younger kids as often exist in public school .In my opinion , that 's a perfect example of well - socialized behavior .So although a child can learn socialization in a public school setting , I believe proper socialization skills can be learned more easily in a homeschool setting .Great post - especially about the part that homeschooled children get opportunities involving socialization that public school kids just do n't have .Since core lessons do n't typically take 6 hours to teach ( like public schools ) , the student has even MORE time to interact with community groups , non - profit organizations , or whatever worthy social interests the student wants to pursue .This gives the student opportunities to really build some notable accomplishments that would be tougher to achieve in a public school environment ( You can just imagine this exchange from a public school student talking on the phone with her favorite charity , \" What ?A once - in - a - life - time series of charity events that starts at 10AM and lasts for the next 4 days ?Sorry , but I do n't get out of school until 2:30PM \" .Bummer ) .Well stated .I whole - heartedly agree that homeschoolers need not get \" stumped \" by this question .As you articulately pointed out , it all comes back to truly understanding what socialization is and is n't .Not to knock public - schooled kids , because I know some who are true gems , but I marvel at how society - at - large can cry \" socialization ! \"and then wring their hands at the prevailing mediocrity making its way from the campus to the workforce .Too often , children in a public school setting are n't learning the kind of socialization that will allow them to become productive adults , but the kind that gets them invited into the right clique .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"107.525314"}

Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) has emphasized this point , arguing that \" [ J]ust because some in Congress may prefer the policies of one State over those in Vermont , does not mean we should give those policies federal enforcement authority across the nation . \"As an example , Leahy pointed out that Vermont allows the carrying of concealed weapons without a permit , while Massachusetts ' law bars that practice .\" When Vermonters travel to neighboring states and across the nation , we understand that we must conform our behavior to the laws of the States we visit .When residents of each State may carry with them only the laws of their own State , they may be advantaged or disadvantaged but one thing is clear : We will have turned our federal system on its ear . \"Looking Ahead .The overwhelming margin by which the House endorsed the CCPA - the vote was 276 - 159-amply demonstrates the extent to which abortion foes have mainstream appeal going for them on this issue .In their strategic calculations , bill proponents probably also did not overlook the fact that President Clinton signed a mandatory parental notice law while governor of Arkansas .As with the pending ban on \" partial - birth \" abortion , which the president also has said he would sign if it were modified only slightly to include an exception to protect the woman 's health , antiabortion leaders are unlikely to take up the president 's challenge .Apparently they have made the political calculation that , new law or not , they have a winning horse to ride into the fall campaigns .Rights and Obligations of Parents .Historically , philosophers have had relatively little to say about the family .This is somewhat surprising , given the pervasive presence and influence of the family upon both individuals and social life .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"107.65279"}

{"text":"In fact , the law does not interfere with minors ' ability to obtain confidential services from Title X - supported clinics and other providers who serve minors with federal funds .In 2000 , the South Carolina legislature considered a bill to prohibit the use of state funds to distribute condoms and other types of contraceptives to minors younger than age 16 whose parents had registered an objection with the state health department to their child 's receiving such services .The measure was passed by the House of Representatives but dropped during committee consideration in the Senate .Similar measures in other states did not receive serious consideration , even at the committee level , and none were enacted .Moreover , over the last 30 years , states have passed laws explicitly authorizing minors to consent to health care related to sexual activity , substance abuse and mental health care .This expansion of minors ' authority over health care decisions was spurred in part by U.S. Supreme Court rulings extending the constitutional right to privacy to a minor 's decision to obtain contraceptives or to terminate an unwanted pregnancy .It also reflects a recognition on the part of lawmakers that while parental involvement is desirable , many minors will not seek services they need if they have to tell their parents .The Alan Guttmacher Institute has periodically reviewed state laws pertaining to minors ' authority to consent to medical care and to make other important decisions without their parents ' knowledge or permission .This year its review was expanded to also take into account state court decisions and attorneys general opinions that affect young people 's access to confidential services ( see table ) .The review , conducted in July 2000 , found the following : .( With respect to HIV , three states limit this authorization to testing only . )No state explicitly requires parental consent or notification for any of these services .However , two states - Texas and Utah - prohibit the use of state funds to provide contraceptive services to minors without parental consent .And one state - Iowa - requires that parents be notified if their child receives a positive HIV test .In Alabama , for example , minors aged 14 and older may consent to general medical care ; in South Carolina , they may do so at 16 .The States and Abortion .The one notable exception to the expansion of minors ' decision - making authority on health care matters is abortion .Only two states - Connecticut and Maine - and the District of Columbia have laws that affirm a minor 's ability to obtain an abortion on her own .The Supreme Court has said that a confidential alternative is required to protect a minor 's constitutional right to privacy .Utah is the only state whose statute does not meet this requirement .Efforts to enact new parental involvement laws in the context of abortion have slowed in recent years .Between 1991 and 1997 , the number of states with laws in effect mandating parental consent or notification rose from 18 to 30 , but between 1997 and 2000 , that number increased by only one .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"108.54092"}

{"text":"Good morning , and thank you all for coming today .My name is David Masci and I 'm a senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life .I 'm not sure whether you had trouble with the name Ayotte , but I certainly did , in pronouncing it .I actually called the office of Attorney General Kelly Ayotte , obviously one of the parties in the case , and was told to think of a large pleasure boat , a yacht - which was actually very helpful because I was calling her a variety of other things .I 'd like to talk a little about the issues at hand in the case .But before I do that , let me just take a minute to tell you about the three groups that are sponsoring today 's discussion .The Pew Forum , the organization I work for , is part of the Pew Research Center , which is a nonpartisan fact tank that provides information on issues , attitudes and trends shaping America and the world .As for the Pew Forum , its mission is to provide timely information on important issues at the intersection of religion and public affairs .We are nonpartisan in nature , and that means we do not take positions on any topics , including the ones we are going to be discussing today .The Federalist Society is a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in law and public policy .It is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom and that it is the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is , not what it should be .The society seeks to promote an awareness of these principles and to further them through its activities .The American Constitution Society is one of the nation 's leading progressive legal organizations .While I 'm on the subject of our partners , I 'd like to thank Dean Reuter and David Ray of the Federalist Society , and Bill Yeomans of the American Constitution Society for their outstanding efforts and hard work in helping us to organize this event .Today we are here to talk about the Ayotte case , which will be argued before the Supreme Court tomorrow .Ayotte is significant in part because it is the first abortion case the Supreme Court has taken up in five years , and the first such case that the new chief justice , John Roberts , will hear .It is also the last abortion case Sandra Day O'Connor is likely to hear , and if it is re - argued , which is entirely possible , it could also be the first case to come before her replacement .Ayotte involves a challenge by a number of abortion providers to a New Hampshire parental notification law , which requires that a parent or guardian be notified at least 48 hours before a minor obtains an abortion .The challenge hinges in part on the fact that the law does not include a so - called \" health exception , \" an explicit waiver to the notification requirement that would allow an abortion to be performed to protect the health of the minor .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"108.77587"}

Patricia Jehlen , a Somerville Democrat , said the proposed charter cap lift in the bill would not occur until the fall of 2017 , negating any argument for pushing legislation through before the end of the month since it would not take effect for years .Others like Sen. Kenneth Donnelly , of Arlington , and Sen. Jason Lewis , of Winchester , suggested more care must be taken to study why best practices in charter schools are n't being replicated more often in traditional district schools .Jehlen said the money proposed for expanding charters would be better put towards early education , and several senators expressed concern that they could n't see the \" end game \" and worried about creating two competing public school systems .While much of the focus of the debate was on charter schools , the bills also included measures to help struggling schools on the brink of being labeled \" underperforming \" develop turnaround plans to avoid more serious state interventions .Rep. Alice Peisch , the House Education Committee chairwoman , said she was disappointed by the vote .While Peisch said she intended to review the \" very limited options \" for resurrecting the so - called \" challenge school \" sections of the bill , Chang - Diaz said she was dubious about its prospects for passage so late in the session , which ends on July 31 .\" Very little is impossible in the Legislature but I would n't handicap it as likely , which is why I think this was a real lost opportunity today , \" Chang - Diaz said .Murray said she thought the school turnaround initiatives would have a \" very good chance \" of passing on their own , and encouraged Peisch and Chang - Diaz to talk .\" I think if they had been more unified or there had been more unification on the committee maybe things would have gone easier , \" she said .Chang - Diaz said she did n't feel as though she had been abandoned by members of Senate leadership , who allowed the bill to advance only to vote against it on the floor .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"109.62227"}

{"text":"For example , while laws and policies in 23 states specified that all sexuality education must include instruction about abstinence , only 13 states required such courses to cover contraceptive methods .11 Furthermore , only 22 states required that courses on HIV and STD prevention provide information on condom use and other prevention strategies in addition to information about abstinence .12 A large majority of states have developed curricula or guidelines to provide program guidance to local school districts in implementing sexuality education programs .Many of these guides exclude such topics as abortion , homosexuality and masturbation because they are considered too controversial .School districts appear to be more likely than states to require instruction about contraception and STD prevention .In a 1994 survey , for example , the CDC found that more than 80 % of school districts required instruction about the prevention of HIV and other STDs as part of health education , and that 72 % required instruction about pregnancy prevention in their health programs .15 Most students , however , do not receive any instruction until ninth or 10th grade , 16 by which time many have already become sexually active .Even then , the information they receive may be insufficient .\" It is widely believed by professionals in the field that most programs are short , are not comprehensive , fail to cover important topics and are less effective than they could be , \" Douglas Kirby observed .Regardless of whether a state mandates sex education or AIDS education , there is no guarantee that the subject will be taught in all school districts , because many states do not have a mechanism for monitoring program implementation .In fact , there is often wide variation in what is taught , both within school districts and even within the same school .A NEW STRATEGY .Since the early 1990s , sex education advocates report , opponents have brought increasing pressure to bear on school officials and teachers as they have refocused their efforts on local school boards and state legislatures .Prior to that time , opponents had concentrated primarily on national politics .\" They realized that who is in the principal 's office matters more than who is in the Oval Office , \" observes Leslie Kantor .\" They decided to pay attention to elections no one pays attention to , like those for school board and county commissioner . \" As a result of this shift , recent years have seen a sharp rise in the number of challenges to individual school district policies .According to SIECUS , more than 500 local disputes over sexuality education occurred in all 50 states between 1992 and 1997 .19 In contrast , SIECUS documented a total of six local controversies in 1990 .The substance of the debate over sexuality education has also changed , largely in response to the need to combat AIDS .\" The controversy has shifted from whether to offer sex education in schools to what should be taught in these classes , \" observes Susan Wilson , executive coordinator of the Network for Family Life Education in New Jersey .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"110.12421"}

{"text":"Proposal to end charter deadlock on Beacon Hill raises doubts .Share via e - mail .State Senator Sonia Chang - Diaz offered a proposal Saturday to break a deadlock on Beacon Hill that could allow more charter schools to open in Boston and other cities .But charter school advocates immediately dismissed the proposal , describing it as nothing more than a veiled attempt to block the expansion of charter schools .They had previously criticized Chang - Diaz , a Boston Democrat who is cochair of the Legislature 's Joint Education Committee , for allegedly blocking legislation that would have allowed for more schools to open .Saturday 's proposal from Chang - Diaz came with a hitch : In order for more charter schools to open in a given year , the Legislature would have to reimburse local districts for some of the state aid they lose when students in their communities enroll in charter schools .Chang - Diaz touted the proposal as a reasonable compromise .In a statement Saturday she said the deal was hashed out with the lead sponsor of the charter school bill , Representative Russell Holmes , a Boston Democrat .Chang - Diaz has repeatedly raised concerns about the financial implications on local districts of opening more charter schools .\" The question is , how can we give more room for good operating charter schools to expand without in any way penalizing or disproportionately pulling resources away from children in the district system , \" she said in an interview .But by midafternoon , Chang - Diaz faced a fresh round of criticism from charter school proponents .The Race to the Top Coalition , a group of business , education , and civic leaders , said the proposal would enable the Legislature each year to halt charter school expansion simply by underfunding the reimbursements to local districts .The deal between Chang - Diaz and Holmes comes just three days before the Legislature 's education committee is scheduled to decide whether to support allowing more charter schools in Boston and other cities .Chang - Diaz 's cochair , Representative Alice Peisch , a Wellesley Democrat , also expressed skepticism about the proposal .Peisch said she had many questions and that the Race to the Top Coalition raised a legitimate concern .\" At this point in time , I do n't support it , \" Peisch said .\" I appreciate there is an effort to address the impact of expansion on district budgets , but I remain unpersuaded that this is the way to go . \" The bill under consideration includes another concession for local districts in exchange for allowing more charters to open that has broad support .Districts would gain greater flexibility to extend school days , shake up teaching and administrative staffs , and make other changes at schools on the cusp of being declared \" underperforming \" by the state because of persistently low state standardized test scores .Funding of charter schools has long been controversial in Massachusetts .Under state law , every time a student enrolls in a charter school , thousands of dollars in state aid is diverted from his or her hometown district to cover the educational costs .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"111.040695"}

{"text":"Whether the pressure to avoid controversial subjects is real or imagined is a matter of debate .Nevertheless , the perception among teachers is that this pressure not only exists but has also intensified in recent years .\" Teachers perceive themselves as more constrained , \" reports Patti Caldwell , senior vice president of Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona , which provides sex education in public schools in the Tucson area .\" There is limited evidence that they are as constrained as they think they are , but the perception has a significant impact on their confidence . \" Fueling this perception , Caldwell and others say , is teachers ' sense that they do not have the support of their principal and superintendent .\" Administrators ' commitment and comfort with the field is more important than board policy or official doctrine , \" observes Scott McCann , vice president for education at Planned Parenthood of Santa Barbara , Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties in California .Fear of controversy deters many school officials from taking a high - profile position on sex education , proponents say .A LACK OF TRAINING .Teachers and others believe that educators ' wariness of sex education is often exacerbated by a lack of training , which leaves many feeling unprepared to teach the subject .The problems stem from both inadequate instruction during the teachers ' undergraduate preparation and from a dearth of staff development and training opportunities once they are in the classroom .Although undergraduate programs for aspiring teachers generally have at least one course on sexuality education or health education , many of these schools do not require prospective teachers to take such a course .In a 1995 survey of college - based teacher certification programs , for example , fewer than two - thirds required candidates seeking certification in health education to take a course on sexuality , 36 even though sexuality education is most commonly provided by health education teachers . 37According to the same survey , none of the programs required prospective teachers to take a course on HIV and AIDS prevention .Furthermore , very few programs require a course in how to teach these subjects : For example , only 9 % of health education certification programs require students to take a course in sexuality education methodology , and none requires a course on HIV and AIDS education methods .Thus , many new teachers assume the responsibility of sexuality education with neither in - depth knowledge of the subject matter nor adequate instruction in how to teach it .The states share the blame for this problem , because few require that teachers of sexuality education or HIV and AIDS education teachers be certified in a relevant subject , such as health education .Moreover , only six states require training for sexuality educators before they begin teaching , and only nine states and the District of Columbia require such training for teachers of HIV and AIDS education .Once in the classroom , teachers often have little opportunity or incentive to enhance their skills and knowledge . \"Years ago , schools encouraged you to go to workshops , \" recalls McCaffree . \"","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"111.94356"}

Minnesota in which there was no health exception in the parental notification statute , and it did n't strike down the statute for that reason .Stenberg v.

{"text":"But , as the Supreme Court said in Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the court and the states do have an interest in unborn human life .So , in the context of a minor , of a girl underage , is a health exception necessary ?Again , there is nothing in Stenberg that requires it .Planned Parenthood v. Casey seems to indicate that it should not be required .And we have to keep in mind this fundamental distinction between an emancipated minor or woman who has attained her majority , and an underage girl .We notice the laws always treat a minor girl differently than an emancipated minor or woman .She can not go on school trips without a parent 's written consent .She can not take aspirin without her parent 's consent .She can not get a tattoo without her parent 's consent .She is prevented under law from marrying the person who got her pregnant without her parent 's consent .She ca n't put the child up for adoption without her parent 's consent .She ca n't have any kind of surgery at all without her parent 's consent .Why in the world would we call out an exception here in the context of abortion ?This case is not about the right to abortion .Is she going to make that decision without her parent 's involvement ?We do not treat minor girls like women .Their decision - making is not as good .That is why we have a difference between minors and majors in the law .We 've made a distinction that , at certain ages , your decision - making is not as good .And think about the abortion context again for this girl .She 's become pregnant by an older man almost always .She does not live by herself .She 's not married .She has nobody really to talk to about this , and her parents are being walled off until the outcome , which is being set up to wall her parents off during maybe the most difficult period of her entire life .So I think that the Supreme Court will find the New Hampshire statute to be constitutional .There is the question of standard of review , which was mentioned .There are two different cases .There is a Salerno case , which says if you are going to make a facial challenge to a statute , you have to show that in no circumstances would it survive constitutional scrutiny .Or does Planned Parenthood v. Casey establish a new standard or a different standard ?I would say , if Planned Parenthood v. Casey 's undue burden standard changes the overall standard for a facial challenge to a statute , it changes it only in the context of the spousal consent provision that was at issue in Planned Parenthood v. Casey .So I do n't think a facial challenge before the statute has been applied is appropriate here , nor do I think the Supreme Court will find it to be .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"112.73226"}

Ryan Fattman attempted to pass a resolution opposing the housing of the immigrants , but it was sent to the Rules Committee after Rep. Jeffrey Sanchez objected .Gov. Patrick is weighing whether to offer up Joint Base Cape Cod , also known as Camp Edwards , or Westover Air Reserve Base in Chicopee .Local officials in both areas have opposed Gov. Patrick 's plan , and both bases are part of districts where there are empty Senate seats and competitive elections .The governor said the federal government only has asked for four months of usage , and said the detained children are \" not to be brought into the school system , not to be brought into the neighborhoods . \"Saying he announced his consideration of the proposals earlier than usual , Gov. Patrick said there is no \" present proposal \" from Washington D.C.The governor said he has been informed the \" influx \" over the southern border \" has begun to slow \" and said housing the children is \" something we and other states ought to be able to do on a temporary basis .\" The governor said he does not believe Bourne has any legal recourse to stop the plan .Gov. Patrick has been adamant that his decision is not political , and deMacedo echoed that philosophy .\" This is n't a political issue , and I 'm not trying to make it a political issue , \" deMacedo told the News Service .He said , \" If people try to make it political , then I think that 's a shame .\" Matt Patrick told the News Service plans for the base \" may \" become an issue in the campaign , and suggested that many of the concerns that have been raised are the result of \" misinformation . \" \" People should step back and take an emotional inventory and determine what 's pulling their strings , \" Matt Patrick said .\" Try to avoid being manipulated .I think we have an opportunity to do a good thing .\" The governor said the federal government , which operates the bases , would cover all the costs for housing the children , and Matt Patrick said Camp Edwards has its own fire protection and emergency services .The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , which has custody of the unaccompanied children , will place children with family members when possible .\" We need to hear a lot more in my opinion , in regards to what is the end - game here , \" said deMacedo .He asked , \" Is this to allow the 1,000 kids to come here and then ultimately filter them out through our school systems ?","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"112.74466"}

' ' The Advanced Math and Science Academy 's long waiting list \" is an indication that it 's something that 's felt by a lot of people , ' 'Cohen said .Because of its innovative computer science program , the charter school has been invited by the College Board to help revamp the curriculum for its Advanced Placement computer science course , said McGann .Computer science is required at all grade levels .In eighth grade , students study the HTML and JavaScript computer languages , and build and program robots .In 10th grade , they build websites , set up a database , and are introduced to engineering .By 11th grade , they are working on advanced computer - aided design .The school also touts its integrated middle school curriculum , which has students delve into subjects chronologically , so they study the same time period in their English language , history , science and other subjects .Henry Haugland , chairman of the school 's board of trustees , said about half of all students take calculus in the 10th grade , and the school does its own assessments in English and math twice a year to see how students are doing overall .Their efforts seem borne out by test results .The school 's 2009 MCAS scores put it near the top compared with other public schools statewide , based on a Globe ranking that combined students who scored either advanced or proficient on the tests .Ninety - seven percent of the school 's students tested advanced or proficient in English , 97 percent in math , and 89 percent in science and technology .Although Haugland thinks the school is already great , he expects more .\" I think we probably can become a world - class school , ' ' said Haugland .\" I think we can become the best in the world at what we do - I mean that . ' ' These accomplishments are by a school that very nearly did n't open .After the state approved its charter in 2004 , school boards in three area communities sued to have the decision overturned .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"112.74693"}

{"text":"As Nancy mentioned , it 's not being abused .Perhaps that 's because these are straw men - that in fact there are no cases in which a medical emergency would necessitate having an abortion .In the cases about the medical emergencies that Nancy mentioned , one of the amicus briefs addressed each of those and found that in fact , in none of those cases would an abortion actually treat the woman .In fact , the procedure could do the opposite ; it could end up harming the woman .In at least one of the medical cases cited , an abortion would actually cause the woman 's death .So there seems to be an assumption that somehow abortion is safe , when in fact it could cause more harm to the girl than going through with the pregnancy .Bill Saunders , I 'd like to ask you , if you think that , in fact , this argument of medical emergency is really just a straw man to undo the law ?MR .SAUNDERS : I do n't think it 's the key issue in this case , because , as that question indicates , if the girl wants to have surgery for something else , she ca n't get it .Why should she be able to get an abortion without her parent being told ?A parent has to be notified and consent in all these other situations .Why not this one ?It is true that abortion obviously poses risk for the girl - physical risk .Again , would n't you want the parent to be involved in deciding whether that 's the right course ?Our assumption in these cases with underage girls ca n't be that she is going to get an abortion because she 's not a competent decision - maker under the law .It has to be that she has this issue in her life as an underage girl - how does she resolve it ?The statute provides that her parent knows about it and helps her to resolve it .That 's not the same for an emancipated woman .MS .NORTHUP : I would just answer by saying that one of the things I love about the law and adjudication of cases is that facts get put forward and they 're tested by counterfacts , and then they sort of move up the line .In this case , the issue that minors are confronted , like other women , with medical emergencies that can permanently threaten their health , were facts that the plaintiffs established and were not countered by the state of New Hampshire .And I think that 's really important .We can all sit around in this room and talk about whether this doctor is right or that doctor is right but , again , the beauty of the court proceeding is that we 're going to test those facts against the record .And that is the record in this case , and that 's what the doctors in this case are concerned about ; that they will be confronted with a rare event .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"112.90645"}

{"text":"At either end of the femidom there is a flexible polyurethane ring ( as illustrated in the picture ) .How To Use .As with an ordinary condom , open the package carefully , being careful not to tear it with teeth , nails or jewellery .Find a position that is comfortable for insertion , maybe you could squat , lie down , or sit on a chair with legs apart .Tampon users may find the femidom easier to insert due to experience of using internal products .Basically you squeeze the ring at the closed end between finger and thumb until it becomes long and narrow , and then gently insert it into the vagina , lacing it as far up as it will go without being uncomfortable .You need to use your finger to make sure the condom is not twisted or bunched in any way .The other ring at the open end should be left outside the vaginal entrance , where it performs the duty ( according to the instructions ) of acting as a guide during penetration .I have to state here that I find this amusing .I would hope that whoever I was bedding might have some idea on their own of where to penetrate , or maybe I 've just been lucky with my men .But really what they mean is that you have to guide the penis into the ring to make sure it does n't slip in between the femidom and the vaginal wall .You can insert the condom up to eight hours before intercourse , although if you do this I 'd advise a quick check all is still in place before getting down to business !The condom is lubricated on the inside , although you can use additional lubricant .The lubricant is non - spermicidal ( meaning it does n't kill those tadpoles ) and is silicon based .Normal condom rules apply .Also , the femidom can only be used once , by which I mean for one act of penetrative sex only .Removing the condom is pretty easy , just twist the outer ring , which should still be outside your vagina if used correctly , and then pull the condom out , and throw it away .Femidoms can also be used during anal sex .In my own experience of using the condom , inserting it did take me around five minutes , the first time , mainly due to the fact that I was following the instructions as I went along .Although it took me a while to insert , it was not hard work , just a little unfamiliar .I 've used it twice since , and insertion has been a little easier each time .For me the benefits of the femidom are numerous .I like the fact that because it is made from polyurethane rather than latex I can use it with oil based lubricants , meaning I do n't have to carefully check bottles and tubes before purchase if they are to be used in conjunction with the femidom .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"113.058426"}

Romney had no stronger supporter in the commonwealth than Lt .Govenror Bill Bolling .There were no other really definitive endorsements in the state other than Tom Davis for John McCain .Most of the other major Republicans laid low , with Bob McDonnell and George Allen backing Fred Thompson , who sputtered out long before their endorsement mattered .Of all the major Republicans in 2008 , Bolling was most agressive in his support for any of the 2008 GOP candidates .At the time , Romney had positioned himself as the conservative alternative , winning the endorsement of the National Review .But things have changed in the last few years .As Barack Obama pushed Obamacare and its socialistic tendancies towards forced mandates and federal enforcement , eyes turned to Massachusetts where its last Republican governor installed a similar system sans the federal enforcement .But Romneycare is a major shackle on the Romney for President bandwagon , but its doubly - so here in Virginia .Virignia is the epicenter of the anti - Obamacare revolt among states , with AG Cuccinelli captaining the ship .As his signature issue , it puts the health care debate under a super - hot spotlight in Virginia , and will eventually put a spotlight on Bolling 's support of Romney .Now , the bet is that Romney does become the nominee .If that happens , sure Bolling 's early 2008 endorsement will be huge .But if health care drags Romney down , he could be dead weight that drags Bolling down as well as Cuccinelli champions the the demise of government healthcare .As much as I love an open primary , I sincerely dread the thought of a Bolling vs. Cuccinelli primary , even moreso than McDonnell and Bolling last time around .Mostly because I appreciate so much the sacrifice Bolling made in running for reelection - it was that decision that was the catalyst for the GOP renassiance that took place later that year .And while others have made headlines , its been Bill Bolling who has been criss - crossing the commonwealth over the last year working to bring business , keep business , and support business all across the state .His work has n't been headline - grabbing but its been relevant and vastly undereported by both the new and old media .And I still have n't forgotten Bill Bolling the state senator who was the conservative leader in a chamber so riddled with mushy , squishy , fake Republicans .It was Bolling who lead the fight against the Warner tax cuts , comparing them to the end of the Wizard of Oz and what was behind the curtain .But he ca n't beat Ken , and he will never beat him if he has to wear Romney 's colors all over him should Mitt fail in his aspirations ( which I think he will ) .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"114.90465"}

{"text":"And the promise of women 's health in the question of the termination of pregnancies has always been at the center of the court 's jurisprudence on abortion .And that has been true for more than three decades .It has been true since Roe v. Wade .The court has required that if there are abortion restrictions that cause delay , or otherwise ban procedures or ban abortion , there must be exceptions for women 's health .In Planned Parenthood v. Casey , at issue was a parental consent law .And the first thing they did was look at the fact that if there was any waiting involved , there was a medical emergency exception .And the court reasoned , and I 'm quoting here from that case , \" ... that the essential holding of Roe forbids a state from interfering with a woman 's choice to undergo an abortion procedure if continuing the pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health .\" If there is a delay , there must be a medical emergency exception .So , applying these longstanding ( three decades ) and constitutional principles , the First Circuit , in looking at New Hampshire law , said it is unconstitutional ; you need that medical emergency exception .New Hampshire and the Bush administration , and other amici who filed briefs in this case , are arguing for a radical change in this core constitutional commitment from Roe v. Wade onward .And this case , therefore , is a prime example .What 's also not at issue tomorrow is , will Roe v. Wade be overturned .But it is a prime example of the way there has been a push - back to chip away at the right to privacy and the right to abortion ever since Planned Parenthood v. Casey .If the court were to agree with the state of New Hampshire and the position of the Bush administration , then we 're not talking about just chipping away at this core value , this constitutional commitment to women 's health .It would be taking an axe to the trunk of the tree of the constitutional protection and cutting it down .The second issue , which we 've also talked about , is this standard of review that the court is also going to be looking at .And as David said , throughout the 30 years of history on abortion jurisprudence , the court has allowed pre - enforcement ( before the law goes into effect ) injunctions against laws that are unconstitutional on their face .By reading them - like reading New Hampshire 's law - you can read that there is no medical emergency exception , it does not comport with the Constitution .And in those cases , what the court has said is , you can enjoin that law .They did it in Planned Parenthood v. Casey with the requirement in Pennsylvania 's law that a woman must notify her husband .They did n't say this is only unconstitutional for those women in difficult domestic circumstance who can not tell their husbands .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"124.117294"}

{"text":"For example , if there are parental rights , what is their foundation ?Most contemporary philosophers reject the notion that children are there parents ' property and thus reject the notions that parents have rights to their children and over their children .Some philosophers argue for a biological basis of parental rights , while others focus on the best interests of children or a social contract as the grounds of such rights .Still others reject outright the notion that parents have rights , as parents .Some do so because of skepticism about the structure of the putative rights of parents , while others reject the idea of parental rights in view of the nature and extent of the rights of children .The claim that parents have obligations , as parents , is less controversial .Nevertheless , there is disagreement about the basis of such obligations .Apart from biological , best interests , and social contract views , there is also the causal view of parental obligations , which includes the claim that those who bring a child into existence are thereby obligated to care for that child .Philosophers are concerned not merely with these theoretical questions related to parental rights and obligations ; they also focus their attention on practical questions in this realm of human life .There are many distinct positions to consider with respect to medical decision making , the autonomy of children , child discipline , the licensing of parents , and the propriety of different forms of moral , political , and religious upbringing of children .While both the theoretical and practical aspects of the rights and obligations of parents are receiving increased attention , there remains much room for substantial work to be done on this important topic .What is a parent ?The answer one gives to this question will likely include , either implicitly or explicitly , particular assumptions about the grounds of parental rights and obligations .Parenthood and biological parenthood are often seen as synonymous .But of course , adoptive parents are also parents by virtue of assuming the parental role .What does it mean for a parent to possess rights , as a parent ?Why think that such rights exist ?What obligations do parents have to their children ?What is the role of the state , if any , concerning the parent - child relationship ?These questions are central for our understanding of the moral , social , personal , and political dimensions of the parent - child relationship .Philosophical Accounts of Parental Rights and Obligations .When considering the rights of parents , both positive and negative rights are involved .A negative right is a right of non - interference , such as the right to make medical decisions on behalf of one 's child without intervention from the state .A positive right in this context is a right to have the relevant interests one has as a parent in some way promoted by the state .For example , some argue that parents have a right to maternity and paternity leave , funded in part or whole by the state .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"124.45454"}

{"text":"At the end of the twentieth century , this changed .Contemporary philosophers have begun to explore , in a substantial way , a range of issues connected with the rights and obligations of parents .For example , if there are parental rights , what is their foundation ?Most contemporary philosophers reject the notion that children are there parents ' property and thus reject the notions that parents have rights to their children and over their children .Some philosophers argue for a biological basis of parental rights , while others focus on the best interests of children or a social contract as the grounds of such rights .Still others reject outright the notion that parents have rights , as parents .Some do so because of skepticism about the structure of the putative rights of parents , while others reject the idea of parental rights in view of the nature and extent of the rights of children .The claim that parents have obligations , as parents , is less controversial .Nevertheless , there is disagreement about the basis of such obligations .Apart from biological , best interests , and social contract views , there is also the causal view of parental obligations , which includes the claim that those who bring a child into existence are thereby obligated to care for that child .Philosophers are concerned not merely with these theoretical questions related to parental rights and obligations ; they also focus their attention on practical questions in this realm of human life .There are many distinct positions to consider with respect to medical decision making , the autonomy of children , child discipline , the licensing of parents , and the propriety of different forms of moral , political , and religious upbringing of children .While both the theoretical and practical aspects of the rights and obligations of parents are receiving increased attention , there remains much room for substantial work to be done on this important topic .What is a parent ?The answer one gives to this question will likely include , either implicitly or explicitly , particular assumptions about the grounds of parental rights and obligations .Parenthood and biological parenthood are often seen as synonymous .But of course , adoptive parents are also parents by virtue of assuming the parental role .What does it mean for a parent to possess rights , as a parent ?Why think that such rights exist ?What obligations do parents have to their children ?What is the role of the state , if any , concerning the parent - child relationship ?These questions are central for our understanding of the moral , social , personal , and political dimensions of the parent - child relationship .Philosophical Accounts of Parental Rights and Obligations .When considering the rights of parents , both positive and negative rights are involved .A negative right is a right of non - interference , such as the right to make medical decisions on behalf of one 's child without intervention from the state .A positive right in this context is a right to have the relevant interests one has as a parent in some way promoted by the state .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"128.73204"}

{"text":"Some proponents of mandatory parental involvement justify the differential treatment of abortion and other reproductive health services on the ground that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is less a medical choice than a major life decision .Because terminating an unplanned pregnancy can have a significant long - term impact on a woman 's psychological and emotional well - being , they say , parental guidance is especially important .However , states allow minors to make other decisions that can have a lasting effect on their lives .Most states , for example , permit teenagers to drop out high school without their parents ' approval , despite the documented adverse effects associated with the lack of a diploma .Although all states require young people to stay in school at least to age 16 or 17 , except in very limited circumstances , once that age threshold has been reached , the states generally impose no barriers to minors ' deciding to leave .A few states permit a minor to marry without parental consent under certain circumstances , usually pregnancy .Notably , more than half of the states that require parental involvement for abortion permit a pregnant minor to make the decision to continue her pregnancy and to consent to prenatal care and delivery without consulting a parent .In addition , 11 states make no distinction between minor and adult parents ; in these states , it appears , the decision to relinquish her child for adoption rests with the young mother .In practice , it is likely that some adoption agencies and judges ( all adoptions , regardless of the mother 's age , have to be approved by a court ) require that a young woman 's parents be involved in the adoption decision .In principle , however , virtually all states consider a minor mother capable of making an independent decision about whether or not to place her child for adoption ( although a few states require that the minor have a court - appointed guardian ) .Ensuring Minors ' Access to Health Care .Most youth - serving agencies and medical professionals believe that access to confidential services is essential , because many sexually active adolescents will not seek care if they have to inform a parent or have their parent 's consent .\" Minors ' consent laws are extremely important , \" argues Abigail English , director of the Center for Adolescent Health and the Law .\" They encourage young people to seek the health care services they need and enable them to talk candidly with their providers . \"Advocates of parental involvement laws , which include organizations such as Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council , maintain that minors ' consent laws reflect \" an increasing nonchalance about the sanctity of the family unit on the part of the government . \"Government policies , they contend , undermine parental authority and family autonomy .Conservative activists also argue that granting minors access to confidential services is tantamount to condoning sexual activity .Despite access to contraceptives , they say , pregnancy rates among teens remain high .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"129.9021"}
