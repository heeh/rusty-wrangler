{"text":"Should I worry about long term , since we have to go for 37 treatments .Hello Michael .This is a great question , and one that can be best answered by a pharmacist or your mother 's prescribing doctor .Basically , if she 's taking fairly regular doses of Xanax weekly , will she develop physical dependency on Xanax ?Seek medical advice for this so that you can know what to expect .I am concerned about my older brother .I know he takes Xanax , sometimes adderal and that he also drinks excessively .Last weekend he locked himself in a bathroom and can only imagine what he was doing in there .He turns into an entirely different person and does n't even seem to remember the awful things he does .He also seems like he 's in denial and has started lying about other things that I know he 's done .I also know that he does cocaine .This has been going for years .I have no idea what to do .What happens to people after this long ?Hi Sarah .Physical dependence on the drugs can happen .Or damage to the liver or kidneys .Plus , lots of negative social , work , or family consequences .I 'd suggest that you plan an informal or formal intervention with your family .The goal would be to get him to realize the need for help , and to accept going to seek help .Also , look into family therapy .Often , there 's something dysfunctional in a family system which causes compulsive drug use in the first place .Does that help ? hello , my doctor gave me a 1 mg prescription , taken three times a day as needed .But I have to take it to sleep , because i 've tried every sleeping pill there is and they do n't work , But the real problem is that I have to take about 10 mg of xanax to actually go to sleep because I have insomnia .what are your opinions .please and thank you -Zay .Hi Zaatrix , Talk to a psychologist about your anxiety !While a normal part of our modern human life , anxiety should not hold you hostage while you try to sleep .Lifestyle changes can help , as can meditation .But taking so much Xanax is not good for you , either !Ok so I was really stupid and drank 9 beers and took 6 mg of Klonopin and maybe 20 mg of flexeril(muscle relaxer ) .I woke up and was fine but I 'm worried that if I had respiratory depression if that may have caused brain damage that is not noticeable .Is this likely ?Hi BJ .The only way to diagnose possible brain injury is to seek the counsel of a neurologist and to undergo diagnostic procedures , such as an MRI or CT - scan .These brain imaging procedures can help pin point possible injury ... but they are expensive and may not be necessary .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"76.07889"}

{"text":"If you are taking prescription xanax and are used to a certain level of it and stick with your prescribed dose , and if you do n't drink while you are using it , you probably wo n't suffer blackouts .But you still might and not know you did .That is sort of the definition of a blackout .For example , I was taking xanax for 6 years .Always according to prescription .However , I did go out and drink a little during that time .I did n't notice any blackouts .But I definitely had one at least .I found out about it months later online .I ran into a friend on facebook .He knew all about my daughter and the school she was in .I assumed it was because is in the business that she is going to school for .A week or 2 later I asked her how she knew this guy .She said she did n't .So I asked him later online how he knew about my daughter .He said I told him one night at a bar .I have absolutely no recollection of even seeing him at any bar ever .But apparently I did , and it was no casual conversation .So the blacking out form xanax can be very insidious .I got off xanax in a rough way .I got a job but could n't learn how to do it .Very uncharacteristic of me .So I lost that job in 2 months .I panicked and went to my doc to ask if i could get a higher dose of xanax for a month ( not realizing it was xanax that caused me to lose the job in the first place , but tha'ts another story ) .Instead he cut me off cold turkey .Before I describe what then took place , let me stop a second and tell you why I 'm here in the first place .This is not whining or blaming .It was my abandoning of my usual great care about using any drugs that caused this to happen in the first place .I let my guard down and got punished , but it was me who was careless .I started xanax 6 years ago because of a stalking situation .I asked the doc for a few a month to get my nerves under control .He would not do that .He inisisted I take Effexor and also take xanax regularly to counteract any anxiety from the Effexor .What did I know ?I did research it but the bad effects of xanax are not well - reported .So I did what he said to do .It worked very well .I got off my ass and took all the steps to rid myself of the jerk .But xanax does n't let go so easy .Over a few years my dosage went up and up .I lost a couple jobs in that time .Employers knew I was on xanax but they had wives on it and did n't see it as a problem .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"84.373184"}

{"text":"Because of their short half - lives , these drugs leave the body and brain so rapidly that they can shock the brain into potentially life - threatening seizures .It took me 3 seizures from trying to get off Xanax on my own before I got some tips from people on this forum ( milo ?Francoise ? ) about what was really going on .I learned that , for anyone going off of these drugs after being on them for months or years , it is extremely important to first switch to a long - half - life drug like Valium ( or Klonopin ) before tapering slowly off of the drug .While Xanax has a half life of 11 hours , Valium has a half - life of almost 200 hours per dose .Valium is also a relatively big pill , meaning you have the opportunity to break the pill down into gradually smaller and smaller doses to give yourself a smooth , safe taper .But Ativan , for example , is already only .5 to 1 mg or so , so it 's very hard to break the pill down to taper with .Plus , even if you could shave the pill down gradually , the short half life would still present the danger of shocking your brain into a seizure .Since my doctor switched me to Valium , I 've been slowly tapering down , but now I do n't fear those horrible seizures , which can be life - threatening .The valium leaves the body so slowly , that it 's gradually becoming less and less likely that I will experience any more seizures .As far as the difference in effect , all these drugs are eventually metabolized by the body into diazepine -- it 's just a matter of how fast and how long - lasting .So , be warned , but do n't be afraid -- now that you know -- when you want to discontinue the Xanax , first have your doctor switch you to Valium for the period of your taper .This will help keep you safe from sudden withdrawal seizures and give you a slow , comfortable detox with a minimum of discomfort .It 's shocking how many doctors do n't even know this , causing them to just cut their patients off and put they 're lives at risk needlessly .Patient , educate thyself !By the way , the warning signs of an impending benzo - withdrawal seizure are typically numbness in the hands and feet , aura , extreme muscle tension , extreme anxiety , tight chest , shallow breathing .But it 's the numb hands that are the biggest giveaway that a seizure is imminent .If you 're tapering off benzos and you experience some or all of these symptoms , get to your doctor or to an ER ASAP ! !Remember , you could have a benzo - related seizure behind the wheel of a car and kill innocent people .Just food for thought .Now , the criminal part , mmmmm , your name is n't Soprano , is it ?","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"88.318535"}

{"text":"The next morning , Riedel admitted to officers he had been drinking .According to court documents , he said he did n't remember running over Flower .At one point , Riedel faced a felony hit - and - run charge .These days , his record is clean , thanks to Columbia County District Attorney Jane Kohlwey and Riedel 's attorney , Bruce Rosen of Madison .Rather than potentially stand trial on the charges , Riedel was offered a deferred prosecution agreement .Under Wisconsin law , a deferred prosecution agreement allows a person facing criminal charges to fulfill certain conditions in return for a dismissal of the charges against them .To be eligible , the offender , in this case Riedel , usually does not have a criminal record , must be willing to participate in the agreement and accepts responsibility for the crime .An investigation by the Baraboo News Republic , a sister publication to The Capital Times , revealed that Kohlwey pledged to destroy documents that detailed what Riedel would do to get the charges against him dismissed .Meanwhile , Flower was kept in the dark .Last August , the manner in which this case was handled caused the Crime Victims Rights Board , an independent agency with staff support from the Wisconsin Department of Justice , to reprimand Kohlwey for her handling of the case .With no felony conviction , Riedel could continue to own and operate a gun .The deal saved his career .In an interview with the News Republic in December , Kohlwey said saving Riedel 's career was not her intent and that entering into the \" secret agreement \" to keep the conditions of the deferred prosecution agreement confidential was a \" serious judgment error .While the charges against Riedel still were pending , Hillsboro Police Chief Thomas Richardson needed to fill a part - time spot on his small staff , a staff that included himself , another full - time officer and two part - time officers .Richardson said when he called Riedel 's attorney and authorities in Sauk County , he was told the charges against Riedel were going to be dismissed .With no conviction pending , Richardson said he felt comfortable hiring Riedel as his third part - time officer .He is a very good officer , and therefore he is still working here , \" Richardson said .\" From what I understand , he got messed up with the wrong girl .Like Riedel , Henderson -- the Madison officer who was fired -- also received a deferred prosecution deal .He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and making a telephone threat connected to an incident with his stepson and was terminated from the department in 2006 , but the charges against him were dismissed after he completed the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement .Henderson 's domestic violence issues came to light after he allegedly put his wife 's 15-year - old son in a headlock and slammed him into a door in 2004 .His wife told officers investigating the incident with her son that she had twice called police to report domestic violence incidents , but when they arrived , she told them that nothing happened because she feared Henderson would lose his job .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"95.89032"}

{"text":"Short - acting benzos like Xanax and Ativan work fine while you 're on them .The problem occurs when they 're abruptly discontinued .Because of their short half - lives , these drugs leave the body and brain so rapidly that they can shock the brain into potentially life - threatening seizures .It took me 3 seizures from trying to get off Xanax on my own before I got some tips from people on this forum ( milo ?Francoise ? ) about what was really going on .I learned that , for anyone going off of these drugs after being on them for months or years , it is extremely important to first switch to a long - half - life drug like Valium ( or Klonopin ) before tapering slowly off of the drug .While Xanax has a half life of 11 hours , Valium has a half - life of almost 200 hours per dose .Valium is also a relatively big pill , meaning you have the opportunity to break the pill down into gradually smaller and smaller doses to give yourself a smooth , safe taper .But Ativan , for example , is already only .5 to 1 mg or so , so it 's very hard to break the pill down to taper with .Plus , even if you could shave the pill down gradually , the short half life would still present the danger of shocking your brain into a seizure .Since my doctor switched me to Valium , I 've been slowly tapering down , but now I do n't fear those horrible seizures , which can be life - threatening .The valium leaves the body so slowly , that it 's gradually becoming less and less likely that I will experience any more seizures .As far as the difference in effect , all these drugs are eventually metabolized by the body into diazepine -- it 's just a matter of how fast and how long - lasting .So , be warned , but do n't be afraid -- now that you know -- when you want to discontinue the Xanax , first have your doctor switch you to Valium for the period of your taper .This will help keep you safe from sudden withdrawal seizures and give you a slow , comfortable detox with a minimum of discomfort .It 's shocking how many doctors do n't even know this , causing them to just cut their patients off and put they 're lives at risk needlessly .Patient , educate thyself !By the way , the warning signs of an impending benzo - withdrawal seizure are typically numbness in the hands and feet , aura , extreme muscle tension , extreme anxiety , tight chest , shallow breathing .But it 's the numb hands that are the biggest giveaway that a seizure is imminent .If you 're tapering off benzos and you experience some or all of these symptoms , get to your doctor or to an ER ASAP ! !Remember , you could have a benzo - related seizure behind the wheel of a car and kill innocent people .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.67401"}
{"text":"Its kinda long winded ... but i guess that s not really different from any of my other posts , ha .Anyway here it is copy / pasted from the original document : . \"Dependency \" is a normal physiological ADAPTATION to repeated dosing of a medication .An opioid - dependent patient with chronic pain has improved function with their use of the drug .It is the use of a drug for medicinal purposes that can cause an eventual physical need for that drug .Physical dependence is solely a physical state , indicating that the body has grown so adapted to having the drug present that sudden removal of it will lead to negative consequences such as a withdrawal reaction .\" Addiction \" is a COMPULSIVE behavior that demands more and more of a drug , regardless of the consequences that lead to dysfunction .It is the EMOTIONAL need for a drug .A person who is addicted to opioids has a disease that undermines optimal function and drives one to compulsively use a drug , despite the negative consequences .dependency is not necessarily indicative of addiction or drug abuse .Hope that helps ya understand that use of meds is nt a bad thing .I hate to see people suffering from things , ESPECIALLY anxiety , because they re afraid because they \" do nt wanna get addicted \" .It 's definitely not situational anxiety , and although she is under extra stress at the moment ( school pressure / moving ) she pretty much always has it .I tried to talk to her about Xanax / lorazapam and she 's against them because she does n't want a bunch of man - made chemicals in her system everyday that makes her feel numb or has a bunch of side effects .She wants the SJW/5HTP since they 're natural , but needs the Imitrex so I do n't really know what other options there are at this point .She does n't believe in going to a psychiatrist to be put on drugs , so I do n't think prescriptions are even a choice now .Do n't worry about the long text Grey , I 'd rather that then a short answer with little explanation .Although I looked at Imitrex under the ' Interaction Checker ' and it seems to not do well with most SSRI 's , and 5HTP is even considered a \" major interaction \" and can lead to serotonin syndrome as well .I 'm sorry but what s 5HTP ?Will it help with my depression or anxiety too ?Its starting to say Fish Oil helps with depression .Hope that helps you .For regular Fish Oil at GNC it was 11 dollars .The ones with more DHA in it it goes up 1 or 2 $ .Just to confirm what sweetlemon said , imitrex does not interact with any benzos or SSRI depression medications .And i ca nt tell you INDEFINITELY that MAOI antidepressants do nt interact , but i ve never heard of anything like that .Imitrex is nt a very ' volatile ' substance , in fact it can be bought OTC in the UK .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.74477"}

Burke Jr. said .The judge said he was particularly swayed by the testimony of two Wilkes - Barre police officers who showed up at Glodzik 's home on April 17 on the report of an intoxicated and out - of - control female causing a disturbance .Sgt .Charles Casey and Officer Alan Gribble , who eventually arrested the Nanticoke woman on public drunkenness and disorderly conduct charges , said an extremely drunken O'Donohue did n't have any visible injuries and never alleged abuse by Glodzik before shouting vulgar slurs and spitting on them .At one point , they inquired about a single bruise on her leg and she said it was caused by another man and told them it was \" none of your ( expletive ) business , \" they said .The ruling was a victory for Glodzik , who has various other legal battles ahead of him , including a criminal trial starting Monday on allegations he pocketed $ 2,100 in bait money in an FBI sting operation after a tow .Glodzik , owner of LAG Towing , was Wilkes - Barre 's exclusive towing contractor from April 2005 until his May 31 , 2013 arrest for the alleged theft .Glodzik 's attorney Joseph Sklarosky Sr . , who has called the theft case \" bogus , \" said the ruling was the start of the vindication process for Glodzik .\" Have you read the papers lately - the last year and a half ?It 's nice to win one , \" he said .O'Donohue 's attorney Andrew Katsock argued it 's possible , and likely , the cops were more apt to take Glodzik 's side because he developed a cozy relationship with police officers during his time as the city 's towing contractor .The Citizens ' Voice has previously reported the FBI is looking at possible connections among Wilkes - Barre police officers , auto loans and Glodzik as part of a wider investigation , but that issue was not raised on Thursday .On the night in question , Katsock noted Glodzik bypassed the county 911 dispatch center and summoned police to his Morgan Drive home by calling several officers on their personal cell phones .He got Casey to admit he and Glodzik are friends and he once attended a social function at Glodzik 's home years ago .Gribble , one of the officers Glodzik contacted directly on the phone , seemed insulted his integrity was being questioned after 20 years on the force .\" I 'm not going to screw that up for anybody , \" Gribble told Katsock .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"100.21817"}
