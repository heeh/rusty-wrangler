{"text":"Not very good customer service when you ca n't even relate or justify my feelings or frustrations .6/22/2007 , the saga continues .My daughter and her friend were to fly out today at Noon .Because they are traveling as unaccompanied minors I had to make special arrangements for someone to take them to the airport , stay with them until their flight left , and arrange for someone to be there to pick them up .Everything was all set .AT midnight , the night before ( last night ) , I get a call from NWA telling me the flight is canceled !They have to put them on an early morning flight and I need to give them a commitment right then .Nice .My girls who are still awake now must finish up any unfinished packing , get to bed and be up in less than 5 hours to catch a flight .This was not a good way to end the trip .Fortunately , I was able to get the mother to re - arrange her schedule ( from work ) to get to the Detroit airport to pick them up 4 hours earlier than originally planned .I pray this last leg of the trip is uneventful , and just glad my time with dealing with NWA is over .I forgot to mention .Went to the airport last night to get reimbursed for the clothes I bought .I was told I would be reimbursed $ 50 for \" each ticketed passenger \" the first day and $ 25 each additional day for each ticketed passenger .I reiterated on the phone that it was only one suitcase lost , but that it contained the clothes of two people .Customer service reiterated I should not have a problem as reimbursement if per ticketed passenger and not # of luggage .I get to the airport - they will only reimbursed me $ 150 for one person .They tell me the policy is only a maximum of $ 150 .So why did n't the person on the phone tell me this ?Second trip to the airport to get reimbursed ( more gas and time ) and I 'm now another $ 250 in the whole ( their replaced clothes actually came close to $ 400 ) .Right now I do n't have much confidence in NWA nor am I impressed with your customer service .When will the suitcase arrive ?I have no idea ?Will I ever get reimbursed for the replacement clothing ?I have no idea .Right now I doubt either will happen .I do n't have much confidence in NWA !My husband and I decided to take a vacation 6 years overdue , we could have used another airline that would have been $ 50 cheaper but decided to use Northwest for two reasons , because of the size of the airline and also because they offered non - stop .Seemed like a no - brainer to go with Northwest .Our flight was from Minneapolis to Orlando .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"34.70838"}

Don´t let anyone hold you by the hand or wrist - they may whip your watch or wallet off you .They would much rather rob someone who is clueless and unaware than someone who is confident and challenging them .You are more likely to have problems in the south and east of Europe - specifically Italy and Eastern Europe .In these areas the train staff will often not take much interest in anything and you can´t expect much help from them .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"62.277645"}

{"text":"I made my request , mentioned the two trips that I have already purchased tickets for in January , and informed Northwest that these two trips would put me in excess of 50,000 miles in a 10 month time frame .To their credit , Northwest responded quickly .The first response informed me about an exciting opportunity to earn gold status by flying 5 round trips in certain fare classes in the first 90 days of 2008 .Of course that would be great if I ever flew in those fare classes .When I responded that would not help me and that my company would not be willing to pay more for a ticket so I could have a particular fare class , I got a \" we make no exceptions \" response .I was told that the only way to earn gold elite status is to fly the right number of miles in a CALENDAR year , not just in a 12-month timeframe .This seems crazy to me and their \" no exceptions \" response is insulting .I know they must get many requests and I would n't expect them to grant all of them .I certainly did n't expect ( or request ) the silver status they gave me in the years I did n't travel much .My final response to them has been sent .In that response I pointed out that they were willing to make exceptions when I did n't travel often and did n't request it but would n't consider a request when I was actually giving them a lot of business .That seems backwards to me .I also have made two offers to discuss this and my other concerns about Northwest customer service with anyone who is interested .I included my phone number each time .After the last response from Northwest , I contacted another airline that flies the routes that I travel most frequently .If they are willing to grant me status in their frequent traveler program , I will be switching my business .My husband is also a gold level traveler ( was platinum last year ) and he is also considering making a switch based on Northwest customer service .Northwest has disappointed me for some time with the level of service they provide in flight and the nickel and dime approach to amenities .When I have had to travel other airlines this year , I have been impressed by how much better the service is .If Northwest does n't reconsider , I have very little reason to stay .I am amazed by how little the airlines seem to care about their customers .Clearly the airlines that have figured this out ( Southwest , JetBlue ) are the only ones doing well .Why are the large carriers having such a hard time understanding such simple concepts ?This is EASY stuff to fix and they just seem unwilling to address a growing problem .MINNEAPOLIS , MINNESOTA -- I used to fly NW a lot way back when , but have n't much in the last few years .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"73.537"}
