{"text":"In September 2003 , CIA Director George Tenet requested a Justice Department probe of the possibility that high officials of the Bush administration leaked to journalists the secret CIA identity of Plame .In December 2003 , Patrick J. Fitzgerald was appointed Special Counsel in charge of investigating the leak of the identity of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame .A grand jury was convened to hear testimony from reporters and members of the Bush administration .The federal indictment suggests that Libby lied about what he told reporters Tim Russert , Matt Cooper , and Judith Miller .\" When citizens testify before grand juries they are required to tell the truth , \" Mr. Fitzgerald said .In February 2002 , Joseph Wilson was asked to travel to Niger by the Central Intelligence Agency in order to investigate claims that Niger had sold yellowcake uranium to Iraq , a substance that - after a lengthy purification process - can be used to make a nuclear weapon .On the 28th of January , 2003 , President George Bush stated in his State of the Union address that , \" The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . \" Much of the President 's address was focused on building support for the War in Iraq , on the grounds that Iraq had been developing Weapons of Mass Destruction , and this statement was a key part of the rationale to justify going to war .On July 6 , 2003 , Wilson wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times attacking the validity of Bush 's assertion by describing how his experiences in Africa had led him to believe no such sale had taken place .He went on to accuse the Bush Administration of manipulating intelligence data in order to exaggerate the threat posed by Iraq .Ultimately , the White House was forced to retract the statement regarding Niger in the State of the Union address .On July 14th 2003 , journalist Robert Novak published a news article that disclosed the identity of Valerie Plame as a CIA operative .Novak attributed the information about Plame 's identity to \" senior administration officials . \"After Novak 's article was published , other news reporters speculated that Plame 's identity as a CIA operative was leaked by the Bush administration in an effort to punish Mr. Wilson for his public criticism of the administration .Valerie Plame and Joseph Wilson are married , although Valerie had been using her maiden name \" Plame \" in her role as a covert operative rather than using her married name .In June 2004 , President George W. Bush was questioned about the leak by the Justice Department , but not in front of the Grand Jury .Bush first promised to fire anyone in his administration who leaked the CIA identity of Plame , then later qualified this as meaning that he would only act if it could be shown that a crime was committed .With the Grand Jury scheduled to conclude its term in October 2005 , reporter Judith Miller was jailed in July 2005 for refusing to reveal the source of the Plame leak .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"67.889435"}
