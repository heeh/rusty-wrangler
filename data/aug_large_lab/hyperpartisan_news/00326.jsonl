{"text":"Recognizing the historical contingency and limits of the old denominational labels is the necessary first step toward thinking about them usefully .Today 's American Jewish denominations are very much the products of their time and place and of the specific circumstances of American religious life as a whole , heavily shaped as that life has been by essentially Protestant nomenclature and modes of organization .Interestingly , the denominational structure is dramatically different from that prevailing in Israel or other places in the world .No less interestingly , the denomination registering the greatest current growth , or at least the greatest internal retention rate , is the one with the least centralized structure and the most thoroughgoing demands on the faithful - namely , Orthodoxy .So is the denominational structure hopelessly obsolete , as the rise of alternative congregations and rabbinical training schools suggests , and should the movements be thinking strenuously of ways to reconfigure themselves ?There is , as it happens , plenty of thinking going on , and plenty of experimentation even within the denominational template .The crucial distinction may lie between those who explore and those who drift away altogether .The sociologist Steven Cohen has written of a dual process of non-and post - denominationalism .The former term refers to those who maintain only minimal ties to formal Jewish life as a whole and who intermarry in substantial numbers ; the latter , those who remain deeply committed and engaged but who express their commitment outside the large formal structures of the denominations .\" Express \" is a key word here .If one feature of modern life is the ascendance of reason and science as sources of knowledge and authority , another is expressiveness , the conviction that the truth is to be found in one 's own subjectivity and in the recesses of one 's own experience and passions .This impulse , helped along by new technologies and forms of organization that make for more diffuse structures of authority and belief , and by currents like feminism that link the expressive ideal with the demand for equality , has powerfully reworked all of contemporary religion .In Western societies today , even the most stringent form of traditionalism is chosen ; if it does not find an echo in the subjective experience of the individual , it will not long endure .But there is another way of looking at the relation between the impulse to maintain boundaries and the impulse to push beyond them .The late anthropologist Victor Turner observed in The Ritual Process that social and religious life proceeds through a dialectic of structure and anti - structure .Both are essential , the one for continuity , order , and responsibility , the other for meaning , passion , and critique .This systole - and - diastole motion can be seriously destructive if it springs from self - indulgence or slides into mere argumentativeness .When driven by real commitment , it may be one of the healthiest features of Jewish life .It is not the denomination per se but how people view them that causes the problem .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"62.13743"}

{"text":"About half of American Jews think continued building of Jewish homes in the West Bank hurts Israel .In general the survey reveals a very strong connection to and support of Israel , a positive trend that appears to be slightly increasing .The statistics about intermarriage provide a wealth of information .Whereas 44 % of Jews said they were married to non - Jews , the number rose to 58 % among those marrying since 2005 .Unsurprisingly , 98 % of those identifying as Orthodox married Jews , whereas 50 % of Reform Jews and 31 % of non - affiliated reported doing so .This , combined with the finding that almost 50 % of those born Orthodox change their affiliation , points to increased intermarriage .But these statistics can be misleading .Although it appears \" just 17 % \" of those married before 1970 intermarried , this does not take into account all those who intermarried who no longer identify as Jews and thus are not included in the survey .In 2001 it was reported that 13 % of those who we d before 1970 were intermarried .Were more pre-1970 intermarriages discovered in the past 10 years or did more Jews come forward who intermarried and begin identifying once again as Jews ?The shock expressed after data such as these is released , showing so much intermarriage , reminds us of the \" Will your Grandchildren be Jews \" article published in 1996 in the Jewish Spectator or the \" Vanishing American Jew \" article in Look in 1964 .Reports of the disappearance or decline of American Jewish community due to intermarriage have been exaggerated in the past , and there is no reason to think the current rate of intermarriage is an existential threat .The Pew research provides an important snapshot of the Jewish community , but it should not be concluded that it reveals major shifts , because it does not .Comparing National and Local Population Surveys .The results of Philadelphia 's latest Jewish population study were released almost four years ago , prompting alarm bells about the high level of intermarriage and low level of affiliation among young adults in particular .But the results of the 2009 \" Jewish Population Study of Greater Philadelphia \" - released in January 2010 - were less alarming than the data contained in a new national survey of the American Jewish population undertaken by the Pew Research Center .The two surveys asked similar questions regarding intermarriage , attachment to Jewish community , the raising of children and attitudes toward Israel .The local survey was sponsored by the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia , while the Pew study got major funding from the Philadelphia - based Neubauer Family Foundation , which has partnered with the Federation to fund incentive grants for Jewish camping .The most glaring difference between the national and Philadelphia surveys lies in what is perhaps Pew 's most interesting twist on the contemporary conversation about Jewish identity .In a sense , the survey created a new category by iden­tifying people who consider themselves Jewish by ethnicity but not religion .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"66.03792"}

Bamberger , who opposed secession , should instead now be followed .To Independent Patriot , I actually think that is a terrible answer to \" What kind of Jew are you ?\" It 's negative , and shows no reason to be actively engaged in a Jewish life but for someone else 's hate .It provides no real reason to maintain an identified Jewish life , something I 've taught my children is paramount , not because people hate them , but because it 's a positive way to live .As for the denominations , the centrifuge of Jewish existence will determine , ultimately , what is relevant and what resonates with those actually living their Jewish lives .Denominations may provide a \" truth in advertising \" baseline , so people somewhat know what they may expect in a given experience , but beyond that , it remains to be seen .No question Chabad is a world unto itself .But it represents a major shift in modern Jewish life .Many Jews who would self identify as non Orthodox are finding themselves part of a community that at its core is dedicated to traditional Jewish principles of Torah and Halacha .Many are leaving Conservative in particular as it drifts closer to Reform ( and Reform itself moves closer to tradition ) .Issues like Gay Marriage etc . are driving people towards Chabad .The new business model is also a factor .But what it basically does is stop frontloading extensive fees .As people become more involved in Chabad they choose to increase their support .The frequently heard complaints like that of Larry Kaufman that the demands are less in Hebrew School etc .It 's clear from the Avi Chai Study this is not true .Chabad has created a new kind of program that is very successful on its own merits .And what usually happens is a deepening of a bond between the Jew and the Rabbi .In Chabad Centers that are based on a smaller demographic the personal relationship is much stronger between the rabbi and congregant then larger liberal congregations .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"68.53894"}

{"text":"I believe the answer is yes , and here I differ from my more radical colleagues , who are proclaiming the end of Jewish peoplehood .At the 2007 United Jewish Communities General Assembly in Nashville , Tennessee , Aaron Bisman , founder of New York - based JDub Records , said : \" The age of peoplehood is over .I agree with Bisman that the decline in interest in Israel has much to do with a move toward universal values , especially among American Jews .But his approach fails to explain why groups of diverse Jews create new kinds of networks and relationships to connect with one another .It is hard to say peoplehood is over when American gay and lesbian Jews are drawn to support their Israeli , Argentinian , and German counterparts , when Russian - speaking Jews see themselves operating in their own global network , whose primary point of interaction is the website livejournal .It does n't explain why new forms of religious communities such as minyanim , chavurot , or Jewish renewal communities are springing up throughout the world outside the traditional synagogue network .But we must hear Bisman , because he reflects a particularly American sensibility that points to the decline in the notion of peoplehood as it is currently understood .The president of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership , Rabbi Irwin Kula , recently echoed Bisman at a Young Jewish Leadership conference .He said the post - war generation successfully achieved its main goals of the 20th century - security , wealth , power , and control over one 's destiny .For the first time , most of the world 's Jews do not have to worry about day - to - day antisemitism or poverty .This means , according to Kula , that the era of worrying about \" the Jewish people \" is over .In its place , he says it is time to stop thinking so much about peoplehood and time to start thinking about , in his words , \" the purpose of the people \" .Twenty - first century Jewish peoplehood is about centres , not a centre ; it is about individual Jews and not \" the Jews \" .It is about Judaism capturing hearts and minds in a spiritual marketplace , not about Judaism as a filial obligation .This notion of peoplehood starts from a global , not diasporic vision that sees Israel , as the above examples show , as part of a creative dynamic diverse Jewish map .Shifting the lens to \" centres \" does not spell the end of klal yisrael , nor does it diminish the importance of Israel as a key Jewish centre .It just allows us to see how Jews and Jewish life flourish in all sorts of places without creating a hierarchy of value based on where people call home .The global community has two ways of responding to the global facts on the ground .This is a conservative approach , which attempts to preserve global Jewish life as it has been .Or the global Jewish community could adopt a more responsive , creative , and entrepreneurial vision of peoplehood and community that looks at the same statistics and comes to the opposite conclusion - that Jewish life is thriving .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"68.76368"}

{"text":"News Analysis : Religious Pluralism Battle Erupts Anew on Two Fronts .Exactly one year ago , a committee headed by former Israeli Finance Minister Ya'acov Ne'eman was putting the finishing touches on what was billed as a historic compromise over the conversion crisis in Israel .It aimed to usher in a new era of dialogue between Orthodoxy and the liberal streams of Judaism and to start a process of reconciliation between Israel and Diaspora Jewry .The compromise was designed to avert the Knesset 's adoption of a bill that would codify into law the Orthodox monopoly over conversions to Judaism performed in Israel .It called for the establishment of an institute in which the three major streams of Judaism would be involved in preparing candidates for conversion , while leaving the actual performance of the conversions under Orthodox control .But one year later , that compromise appears destined to become no more than a historical footnote , and some fear its failure could lead to an unprecedented rift in Israel - Diaspora relations .Although the institute is preparing to open , the compromise proposals were never accepted by Israel 's Orthodox Chief Rabbinate .The liberal movements will participate , but without the rabbinate 's endorsement , Reform and Conservative leaders in Israel fear graduates of the institute may never have their conversions recognized .Nothing , they say , will have been achieved .Instead of dialogue , the apparent failure of the Ne'eman Committee 's compromise has sent both sides in the religious pluralism campaign back to the battlefield - which is now being waged on two fronts .Conversions : Orthodox parties in the Knesset are attempting to revive the conversion bill after the Jerusalem District Court last week ordered the Interior Ministry to recognize as Jewish 23 people who underwent conversions performed by Conservative and Reform rabbis .The bill has been redrafted to incorporate the Ne'eman Committee 's proposals .But leaders of the liberal movements say this undermines the spirit of the compromise , which was meant to avoid legislation codifying Orthodox control over conversions .The ruling is being appealed to Israel 's Supreme Court , which is considered likely to uphold it .But recognizing the potential for further discord , Hanan Porat , chairman of the Knesset 's Law Committee , said he would ask the Supreme Court to postpone hearing the appeal until after Israel 's May 17 national elections .The so - called \" bypass bill \" requires every member of a religious council to abide by rulings of the Orthodox Chief Rabbinate .Reform and Conservative leaders are furious , saying the bill mocks the court 's ruling .This week the Knesset Law Committee postponed the second and third votes on the bill by the full legislature .But at the same time , the Chief Rabbinate ordered local religious councils not to convene as long as Reform and Conservative members take their seats .The liberal streams see much at stake in this battle because the religious councils , supervised by the Religious Affairs Ministry , have exclusive jurisdiction over marriage , kashrut , burial and other religious matters for all Jews living in Israel .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.27075"}

{"text":"Pew 's figures are very close to those reported , also in October , by the Brandeis University 's Steinhardt Social Research Institute , which constructed estimates from hundreds of national surveys .The SSRI estimate of a total population of 6.8 million is a bit higher than Pew 's mostly because SSRI included all children belonging to Jewish households rather than only those whose parents indicated were being raised as Jews .( I am affiliated with the SSRI , although not with the demography project . )The remarkable thing about these figures is how much larger they are than previous estimates , including the well - regarded 1990 National Jewish Population Survey , conducted by the Federation movement , which set the Jewish population at 5.5 million .The Pew Research Center 's report alluded to the population increase , albeit obliquely .Drawing on annual surveys conducted by a variety of research outfits , including Gallup and the American National Election Survey , the report shows a \" long - term decline \" in the Jewish by religion share of the adult population beginning in 1948 .However , the report notes - almost as an aside - that \" the Jewish share of the adult population appears to have held fairly steady in the past two decades .\" How is it possible that , during a period of massive immigration from Latin America and Asia - and notwithstanding average fertility and the high rate of intermarriage - the Jewish population grew at the same pace as the American population ?Some Jewish population growth is due to immigration from the Former Soviet Union and some to the growing Orthodox population - but clearly not all of it .The analysis sketched above suggests that over the past two decades intermarriage did not suppress - and may have contributed modestly to - a Jewish population increase .Indeed , the age distribution reported in the Pew study actually skews young ( although not as young as the American population as a whole ) suggesting the possibility of further population growth in the years ahead .Religious Observance .The rapidly increasing proportion of children of intermarriage in the overall Jewish population also clarifies the modest decline in observance from a decade ago .Comparing the National Jewish Population Survey of 2000 - 2001 to the new survey , Pew reports a decline in attendance at a Passover Seder , from 78 percent to 70 percent , and a decline in observance of the Yom Kippur fast , from 60 percent to 53 percent .It is now evident that these declines are not the result of abandonment of Jewish practice by those who had once embraced it ( or their children ) .Rather , the modest declines reflect the increasing proportion of adult children of intermarriage in the younger generations .Notably , the declines would have been steeper had that population identified exclusively or mostly as Jews of no religion ( instead , they divided evenly between Jews by religion and Jews of no religion ) .Attachment to Israel .Recognizing the growing share of the Jewish population made up of adult children of intermarriage makes the Pew study 's findings about emotional attachment to Israel all the more remarkable .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.39795"}

{"text":"Finally , although more weakly tied to religious observance and the Jewish community , the Jews of no religion still look fairly Jewish in terms of their demographic and political profile .They also express pride in their Jewish identities ( 83 percent ) and hardly ever attend non - Jewish worship services ( just 11 percent attend yearly or more , compared to 59 percent among the non - Jews of Jewish background ) .What do the new analyses tell us about American Jewry 's demographic future ?For more than two decades social scientists have tried to predict the future contours of the Jewish community by asking intermarried parents how they are raising their children .NJPS 1990 reported that 28 percent of intermarried couples were raising their children as Jews ; NJPS 2000 - 01 estimated the figure to be 33 percent .Because these figures were well below 50 percent ( the demographic threshold for breaking even ) , the general view was that intermarriage would drive down the Jewish population .The Pew study offered respondents who were parents a wider range of possible responses .Among respondents with a non - Jewish spouse , 20 percent were raising their children Jewish by religion , 25 percent partly Jewish by religion , 16 percent Jewish not - by - religion , and 37 percent not Jewish .But the Pew report overlooked much more valuable information than parental intent .For the first time , there is data on how the adult children of intermarriage actually turned out .As we have seen , among the Millennials , 59 percent identify as Jewish , roughly divided between those who say Judaism is their religion and those who say they have no religion but identify as either Jewish or partly Jewish .Does this mean that American Jewry 's demographic future is secure ?Perhaps , but not necessarily .The increasing tendency of the children of intermarriage to identify as Jewish , from the oldest to the youngest cohorts , may be related to stage - of - life .Most of the younger Jews in this category will probably marry non - Jews , and whether in the future they or their children will consider themselves to be Jewish is impossible to predict .But we can derive some confidence from the failure of previous grim projections .Since the early 1990s , social scientists , making straight line extrapolations from a small number of data points , have warned about demographic decline and the alienation of American Jewry from Israel .Over the next two decades , the Jewish population increased by more than 1 million Jews , keeping pace with population growth in the broader American society , and attachment to Israel remained as strong as ever .Admittedly , the secret of Jewish survival may be the propensity to panic about our fate .The grim predictions made in the 1990s may have proved wrong because Jewish organizations , federations , and private foundations did what they needed to do to turn the tide .They funded massive new investment in Jewish summer camps , Hillels , Taglit - Birthright Israel , and innovative startups - all programs that reach a fairly wide spectrum of Jewish children and young adults .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"75.13689"}

{"text":"It 's not just Jews who are slipping to liberal denominations from strict ones .Generational shifts between denominations are a common theme across American religions .In the 1960s , as evangelicals became wealthier and more mainstream , they left their Baptist churches en masse for the more liberal mainline Protestant churches , leaving behind congregations associated with low socioeconomic classes .\" That was a very steady flow of people for a lot of years , \" said Mark Chaves , a professor of sociology , religion and divinity at Duke University .This tide slowed in the 1990s , as evangelical churches were more successful at appealing to middle - class professionals .\" It became less important as a status marker for people once they became college educated ... to not be a Baptist anymore and be a Presbyterian or Methodist , \" Chaves said .Mainline denominations , however , had come to count on the evangelical defectors to fill their ranks , and they soon found they had a membership problem that is ongoing today .The Jewish story is similar .Class differences that once drove shifts in denominations have since flattened out , according to Steven M. Cohen , a leading sociologist of American Jewry and an adviser to the Pew study .Decades ago , Cohen said , \" poor Orthodox parents gave birth to middle - class Conservative kids who in turn gave birth to upper middle - class Reform grandchildren . \"Today , however , income levels are relatively even among most groups of Jews , excluding the ultra - Orthodox .It 's difficult to say whether that economic flattening has stemmed the flow of Orthodox Jews to liberal denominations .The Pew findings on the size of the Orthodox community are difficult to parse .On the one hand , it 's clear that the community is n't growing nearly as fast as some of its boosters claim .Though the birth rate among Orthodox Jews is 4.1 children per adult , vastly higher than America 's average of 2.2 , the study found that Orthodox Jews make up 10 % of the American Jewish population .That 's up only 2 % from 10 years ago , according to data from the 2000 National Jewish Population Survey , provided by Cohen .( The Pew survey draws some rough comparisons between the 2000 survey 's findings and the new findings , but notes that exact comparisons can not be made , because of differences in how the surveys were conducted . )According to Pew , the majority of Orthodox Jews are ultra - Orthodox .Modern Orthodox Jews , who are less insular than the ultra - Orthodox and value secular as well as religious education , make up just 3 % of America 's .Jewish population .Ultra - Orthodox Jews make up 6 % , according to Pew .Orthodox Jews who identified as neither ultra - Orthodox nor Modern Orthodox make up 1 % of the Orthodox community .Some large part of the nationwide growth in that community occurred in the New York area , where the population of Orthodox Jews grew by more than 100,000 between 2002 and 2011 , according to a survey published in 2012 by UJA - Federation of New York .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"81.10152"}

{"text":"The stand of Conservative Judaism , as articulated by institutions such as the Rabbinical Assembly and the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York , is clear : Its rabbis will not conduct intermarriages , and it actively encourages activities to promote endogamy .Yet at the same time , virtually all of the leaders of the movement say they favor outreach to intermarried couples and welcome them into their synagogues .As Rabbi David Booth of Temple Beth Torah in Ocean , N.J. , put it in his keynote address to the conference : \" I 'm against intermarriage , not intermarrieds .\" Is this admittedly mixed message viable ?Booth - who spoke of his own marriage with a young women whom he met at college , and who ultimately converted to Judaism - is convinced that the goal of Keruv , or \" outreach , \" is possible .But he , and his movement , face a formidable challenge .To their right , Orthodox Jewry faces no great dilemma about intermarriage .They are opposed to it .To the Conservatives ' left are the Reform and Reconstructionist movements that , while not advocating interfaith marriage , are far more open to accommodating the growing population of interfaith families .In contrast to the Orthodox and the Conservatives , the Reform movement accepts children of a Jewish father and a non - Jewish mother as Jews .And while some Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis still speak openly of opposition to intermarriage , the movements do not formally disapprove of rabbis conducting interfaith ceremonies .Reform 's shift to support patrilineal descent makes it a natural home for intermarrieds .That leaves Conservatives squarely - and not always comfortably - in the middle .On the one hand , they can appeal to a broad audience of Jews who like their more traditional , though non - Orthodox , approach to Judaism .But to the increasing number of people who were raised in Conservative shuls but who find themselves married to non - Jewish spouses , the USCJ 's adherence to principle on this issue is unacceptable .As long as the Conservatives refuse to give rabbinic sanctions to interfaith weddings and oppose the participation of non - Jewish spouses of members in Torah services or their holding positions of leadership in their synagogues , the perception remains that intermarrieds need n't bother coming in the door .Booth understands that \" intermarrieds more often join Reform shuls because Reform rabbis marry them . \"To that end , Conservative shuls should start practicing what they preach about being welcoming .According to Booth , that means they need to do things such as as allowing children who are not Jewish according to halachah to take part in their religious schools in the lower grades .This will give families who are searching for spiritual meaning a real option .They should be allowed to explore and learn about Judaism without making a commitment first or being told they do n't belong .But can such a \" mixed message \" really succeed ?A Community of Faith .Indeed , for many American Jews , any mention of religion , let alone the Conservative take on halachah , is a turnoff .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"88.1944"}

{"text":"But Swedish Jewry , too , has felt this phenomenon .Swedish Jewry seems , however , to have been the only segment of society not just to be affected by the violence , but also to notice it .In the country at large , the tendency of growing Arab and Muslim anti - Semitism has been almost completely ignored , and to this day most Swedes are unaware of the anti - Jewish sentiments among immigrants from Arab and Muslim countries and their descendants .Judging even by Swedish public discourse over the past decades , anti - Semitism no longer belongs exclusively to neo - Nazis on the extreme Right .Yet Swedes have been socialized into treating anti - Semitism as a branch of racism among ultranationalist groups , and anti - Semitism among other sectors - such as the extreme Left , Arabs , and Muslims - is mostly unknown .Moreover , in some cases Arab and Muslim anti - Semitism has been denied .Arab and Muslim Anti - Semitism .Arab and Muslim anti - Semitism has nothing to do with dislike of Semitic peoples in general ; by definition , anti - Semitism can only be directed at Jews .Bernard Lewis notes that a common defense of Arab anti - Semites is that they can not be anti - Semites because they themselves are Semites .Anti - Semitism is the hatred or dislike of Jews qua Jews , nothing more and nothing less .The term was coined in the 1870s by Wilhelm Marr , partly to dress his anti - Jewish sentiment in a new , modern , ostensibly scientific vocabulary and partly to distance it from Christian anti - Judaism .4 It is hard to give an all - encompassing definition of anti - Semitism beyond the fact that it always involves some elements of negative attitudes or notions about Jews .Helen Fein defines it as a lasting , latent structure of beliefs about Jews as a collective .Similarly , anti - Semitism in the Arab and Muslim world has an Islamic and a secular - nationalist dimension .6 The latter is more or less identical with the secular forms of anti - Semitism that developed in nineteenth - century Europe .With the growth of European influence in the Middle East , the Arabs imported not only cheap goods and political ideas but also anti - Semitism in this modern , racist form .The first to embrace it were often the local Christian communities , which had closer ties with European Christians than their Muslim neighbors .With the rise of Arab nationalism , an ideology that Christian Arab intellectuals were often among the first to adopt , the Jews were increasingly seen as an alien body in the Arab world , distinct from the Arab Muslims and Christians .Religious Muslim anti - Semitism differs from Christian anti- Semitism .Traditionally , Islam does not have the same kind of problematic relationship to Judaism as Christianity has , since Jews in the Muslim tradition were perceived as a vanquished people that did not pose any threat to Islam .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.287094"}

Bush and later Barack Obama determined that an Israeli military strike against Iran 's nuclear weapons program does pose a high - level threat to the US .As a consequence , both administrations have taken concerted steps to prevent Israel from attacking Iran .On the merits , both of these policies are easily discredited .But the fact that they continue to be implemented shows that they are supported by a large and powerful constituency in Washington .To oppose Iran 's nuclear program effectively , American Jews are required to oppose these strongly supported US policies .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"93.861244"}

{"text":"If the choice were between Orthodox Judaism and Reform Judaism , you would have a point , and maybe I would agree with you .That is not the choice .The choice of most Jews would be between Reform Judaism and nothing , or even converting out of Judaism .So the correct comparison that should be made is not between Reform / Conservative Jews and Orthodox Jewry .The correct comparison should be between Reform / Conservative and nothing / atheism .Given those are the choices , ( and I can say for the most part , that is the reality ) the real question should be whether Reform / Conservative Judaism is better than nothing at all .And the answer to that question , in my mind , is a clear yes .There are real benefits offered in Reform / Conservative shuls .Firstly , technically speaking , Conservative shuls believe in Halacha , however , the synagogues are integrated by gender , and most of the congregants do not follow Halacha in their daily lives .How is it a negative if Jews in that category are exposed to what is authetic Judaism when they go to shul , which they otherwise would not do ?Then there are Reform congregations , which do not follow Halacha and do not necessarily believe in Halacha .I would argue that the validity of these synagogues is on a case by case basis .Some are basically churches with a few Hebrew words uttered ; I see little value in that and no point in holding on to Judaism if that is all that is left .Other synagogues offer much more .Your analysis is very black and white , whereas the world of Reform / Conservative Judaism is anything but that .Finally , you have not addressed the rest of what I said , which I believe to be the bottom line basis for the self hate .I do not see this as a particularly theological Jewish struggle , except to the extent that Judaism is and can be used as an alternative to the destructiveness of communist self hate .I have atheist Jewish friends who are the biggest Zionists around .They identify with capitalism and secular humanism , and even vote for the religious parties in Israel , as they are also capitalist and anti - communist .The root of the self hate in Israel is the same root found in Eurodhimmiland , the US , and the rest of the West .It is communism , which we know is linked with Islamofascism .It is that root which must be expunged , not Reform and Conservative Judaism .P.S. : I never said that Reform or Conservative Jews are as committed as Orthodox Jews , because they are not .However , most congregations are much more committed to Israel and the Jewish nation than the general population of the US or Eurodhimmiland .Moreover , if any kid of a secular Jew is to make teshuva , they would come from the Reform / Conservative pool , NOT the pool of kids with atheist parents .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"101.8233"}
