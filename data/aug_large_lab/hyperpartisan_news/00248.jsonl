Ariz.Sheriff Arpaio Apologizes for Mishandled Cases .PHOENIX - Sheriff Joe Arpaio apologized Monday to victims for mishandled investigations of a large number of sex - crimes cases as the tough - talking lawman faced a growing outcry over allegations of mismanagement in his office .Arpaio called a news conference to discuss the investigations in the city of El Mirage a day after The Associated Press ran an article outlining some of the bungled cases .The Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office was under contract to handle law enforcement duties in the city on the edge of Phoenix at the time .\" If there were any victims , I apologize to those victims , \" the sheriff said in his office 's most detailed public comments about the cases .Chief Deputy Sheriff Jerry Sheridan said the sheriff 's office is poised to take possible disciplinary action as early as this week against the employees responsible for the cases .The reopened cases resulted in 19 arrests , a figure the sheriff 's office considers to be average and equal to the number of sex - crimes arrests made so far this year countywide .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"51.164215"}
{"text":"Detectives interviewed the suspect , Brian Hester , within three days , obtaining a confession about the girl 's abuse that the Sheriff 's Office had ignored a year before .Sheriff 's detectives , unaware Mesa police had arrested Hester , approached the family months later to try to restart their investigation .\" We said , ' He 's already been arrested , ' \" Hester 's ex - wife recalled .\" My daughter and I looked at each other and said , ' Oh , is n't that a little late ? ' \" But until now , only the victims of the alleged assaults and a few sheriff 's investigators have been aware of the full impact of MCSO 's failures in these investigations .An Arizona Republic investigation into the 400-plus reopened cases reveals the Sheriff 's Office failed to adequately investigate reports of abuse and assault -- in some cases never interviewing a suspect or running a background check .Some cases were ignored -- the files were later found sitting in a drawer or in a deputy 's garage .Those shortcomings , combined with lengthy delays in resolving cases , left alleged predators free to continue finding other victims , sometimes for years .The delays also may have led to some cases never being prosecuted .For example , a sheriff 's detective took 21 months to follow up on a teenage boy 's 2006 allegation of abuse in his home .By the time investigators took the case to the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office in 2011 , prosecutors declined to proceed , citing no reasonable likelihood of a conviction .The Sheriff 's Office delayed for five years an investigation into an allegation against a convicted rapist .While the probe was on hold , another police agency received a report that the same suspect had allegedly assaulted a teenage girl .In another case , the agency ignored for a year one girl 's allegation that her horse trainer had molested her .The suspect was accused of molesting three more girls before being indicted .Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio concedes there were investigative failures in the special - victims unit , but defended his agency for trying to correct the problem after it came to light .He said in an interview last week that difficulty investigating sex crimes is not uncommon in police agencies , and that he felt his agency was being singled out .\" Right now , I 'm comfortable with the management I have , that this situation has been resolved , \" Arpaio said .\" I do n't expect it , and I will not tolerate it if it happens again .I probably will give more special attention to this type of unit than I may have in the past , \" he added .\" I 'll probably look into it more closely myself to make sure it 's running smoothly , and give it more resources .Current and former employees say past staffing shortages were exacerbated by the agency 's preoccupation with other priorities , such as illegal immigration , public corruption and animal - abuse crimes .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"51.47896"}
