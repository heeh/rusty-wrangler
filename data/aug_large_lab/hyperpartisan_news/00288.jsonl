' ' The buck stops at the President .While this committee has been far more successful in obtaining relevant records than any other previous investigation , its painstaking efforts have met with obstruction from President Clinton 's staff at every turn .As a result , in some areas the committee 's investigation is still inconclusive .Since the firings and especially since the 1994 elections , the White House Counsel 's office hired a team of lawyers for a major damage control operation which we have concluded focused on withholding from the committee documents related to Harry Thomason , Mrs. Clinton and President Clinton .In January 1995 , Congressman Clinger became the chairman of the new House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and announced that a thorough investigation into the growing Travel Office scandal would be undertaken .Three hearings had been held and subpoenas were issued when documents suddenly materialized inside the White House that previously had been subpoenaed by other bodies and requested by the committee .On March 9 , 1996 , the U.S. House of Representatives by voice vote adopted House Resolution 369 which authorized committee staff to take depositions pursuant to a subpoena in the White House Travel Office matter .The committee has deposed 72 witnesses , informally interviewed 23 witnesses , obtained 58,734 documents from the White House and approximately 45,000 documents from the Justice Department , Treasury Department and other agencies .The committee was determined to ensure that the Clinton administration did not succeed in its attempt to derail this Travel Office investigation , as it had with every preceding investigation .Unfortunately , the committee found that issuance of subpoenas was not sufficient to ensure the production of all relevant records .It became necessary for the committee to take the rare action , holding White House Counsel John M. Quinn in contempt of Congress on May 9 , 1996 by the committee .It was only after scheduling a May 30 , 1996 , House floor vote on the Resolution that the White House turned over 1,000 pages over which it initially had asserted were ' ' subject to ' ' executive privilege .However , the White House continued to withhold 2,000 pages of documents .President Clinton asserted a blanket claim of executive privilege , stalling for time throughout the summer of 1996 .The White House Counsel 's Office / Chief of Staff 's Sherburne ' ' team ' ' finally provided the committee with access to the 2,000 pages of overly - redacted documents only when a second threat of a House floor vote on contempt of Congress was made .Only at that point did President Clinton finally relinquish the outstanding subpoenaed documents to the committee on August 15 , 1996 .A date calculated to attract the least attention from the media as it was the same evening that Senator Dole accepted the Republican nomination for President .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"55.637833"}

Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt . ) by 44 percent to 40 percent ; Vice President Joe Biden by 44 percent to 42 percent ; and former Vice President Al Gore by 44 percent to 41 percent .The poll also found that 30 percent of respondents believe Trump will eventually be the Republican nominee , leading the field .It is also interesting that Sanders and Biden come closer .At this time it is not known whether Biden will enter the race , and his support could go in either direction if he is seen as a candidate .Sanders has been on an upward trajectory as Clinton 's support has been falling , especially in the battle ground states , and Sanders now looks like the most electable of the candidates who is currently in the race .While Clinton 's support is more limited to strong Democratic voters , Sanders is showing greater ability to reach out to independents .Gallup has results similar to those reported Wednesday from the Washington Post / ABC News poll .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"56.901005"}

{"text":"During the 2008 primary battles , Hillary Clinton argued that she should be the Democratic nominee because Barack Obama was not electable and she was .We saw how that turned out .This year Clinton supporters are trying the same strategy , claiming Bernie Sanders is not electable .As Matt Taibbi discussed in Rolling Stone , the media has also been complicit in spreading this false narrative , often failing to take Sanders seriously as a candidate .Polling data has consistently shown that the argument that Sanders is unelectable is false , and further data this week also demonstrates that he is electable .An NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton and Ben Carson tied , with Clinton beating the other Republican candidates she was matched with .The tie with Carson was largely due to greater support for Carson among independents .They did not poll a head to head race between Carson and Sanders but did find that when polled Sanders did slightly better than Clinton against other Republicans : .Sanders leads Trump by nine points , 50 percent to 41 percent ( versus Clinton 's eight - point advantage ) , and he 's ahead of Rubio by five points , 46 percent to 41 percent ( versus Clinton 's three - point lead ) .National polls such as this long before an election have limited meaning , but seeing Sanders consistently doing as well as or better than Clinton against Republicans does suggest that there is no truth to the argument that Clinton is more electable .There are additional reasons to speculate that Sanders can do better than Clinton a year from now .Sanders is much less well known and on an upward trajectory while Clinton is already well known and has far less upside potential .Clinton had been on a downward trajectory until some fortuitous events for her in October .She came out of the first Democratic debate l ooking strong , but this was largely because she was more skillful at dodging questions and her opponents barely confronted her for poor answers .Republicans will not let her off the hook so easily , and hopefully Sanders and O'Malley will confront her more in subsequent debates .Sanders is not involved in a major scandal , but there is danger for a further drop in support for Clinton as more voters become aware of the specifics of the scandals .While Democrats do not seem to be dissuaded by the scandals , polling has shown that independent voters are concerned , and have an unfavorable view of Clinton .Republicans will probably make considerable use out of the scandals in a general election campaign .Elections often come down to turn out , and Sanders is showing far greater ability to get people to turn out to his events .Hopefully this enthusiasm for him will extend to turning out to vote .On the other hand , many voters are likely to stay home instead of turning out for a candidate which a majority considers to be dishonest and they have an unfavorable view of .[ Due to technical glitches involving links to the post , it was necessary to post this twice ] .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"58.90963"}

{"text":"However the pundits did not predict what has actually happened .Voters are telling pollsters that Clinton won , but an increasing number want Sanders to win the nomination .With the first Democratic debate in the books , a new CNN / ORC poll finds most who watched think Hillary Clinton had the best performance of the night , but her strong showing has n't boosted her standing in the race for the party 's nomination ... .Compared with pre - debate polling , Sanders ' support is up five points since mid - September , but no other candidate showed significant change .Gravis Marketing similarly found that a majority thought Clinton won the debate , but also that Sanders pulled within eight points of Clinton nationally - overall a favorable outcome for Sanders .Clinton is welcome to accumulate debate points if Sanders is picking up voters .Sanders holds a 38 - 30 percent lead over Clinton in the first - in - the - nation primary state , while Biden draws 19 percent in the poll of 403 likely Democratic primary voters conducted immediately after last week 's debate .Sanders ' 8-point lead is essentially unchanged from the 44 - 37 percent advantage the Vermont senator held in a stunning Franklin Pierce - Herald poll in August - the first to show the former Secretary of State behind in New Hampshire .The new poll also has Sanders holding an even bigger 10-point lead over Clinton if Biden is n't in the presidential field .The results suggest Clinton will have a tough time overcoming the deficit , as more than half of notoriously finicky Granite State voters now say they have made up their minds .Seven in 10 Sanders supporters say they 've made a \" firm choice \" to vote for him , a 26 percent increase from the last Franklin Pierce - Herald poll in August .And 62 percent of Clinton backers now report they 're firmly in her column , compared to just 40 percent in August .This does show that the pundits who claimed that Clinton was once again unbeatable after the first debate got it wrong .Beyond that , I would n't believe any predictions that the polls today will accurately predict what will happen when people turn out to vote .If you need an example of that , check out this report from December 2007 describing how Clinton has a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Polls in a primary battle mean very little , and a single debate will not decide the nomination .Nothing is even close to getting settled until people start to vote , and ignore those pundits who tell you otherwise .A lead in the national polls is especially meaningless as these often change dramatically afte the results of the first contests are known .Strong performances by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire can totally redefine the race .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"59.443886"}

Lewinsky could be another damaging political blow for the president following last week 's release of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr 's explicit 453-page report about Clinton 's activities .Aides fear the sight of Clinton being grilled -- particularly in moments where he appears angry , defensive or evasive -- could be a far more powerful political image than even the salacious Starr report narrative of his sexual encounters with the onetime White House intern .The tape , they assume , will be shown repeatedly on television networks and possibly used by some Republican candidates in the fall congressional elections .A GOP congressional aide familiar with the tape yesterday described it as \" devastating \" for the president .Said a White House official who has not seen it , \" We 're going to hold our breath and all watch it together .I 'm totally dreading it because I 'm sure he does n't \" come across well .The development underscored Clinton 's weak position as Congress wrestles with whether to open the first impeachment proceeding against a president since Watergate .With no political leverage , Clinton was unable to negotiate to influence the outcome as the Judiciary Committee 's Republican majority pressed forward with disclosure plans , according to his own advisers .While privately trying to keep the tape secret , White House officials offered no strong public protests and acknowledged there was little they could do about it . \" The House is going to have to employ the video however they see fit and we just hope that it 's not misused , \" said White House press secretary Michael McCurry .\" But it will be up to the House to decide . \"Despite complaints by Democrats on the Judiciary panel , Republicans signaled their willingness to move forward with the release of Clinton 's testimony , as well as that of other key witnesses such as Lewinsky , as early as this week .The committee will meet in secret session to make the decision , expected by Thursday .It could take 24 hours after the vote to prepare the evidence for public release , according to sources .Similarly , Democrats got nowhere with GOP leaders yesterday as they floated a trial balloon for a middle - ground punishment to head off a formal impeachment inquiry .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"59.753162"}

Holder Jr. and Robert S. Mueller III , the FBI director .Both men have declined to comment .FBI agents interviewed Broadwell for the first time the week of Oct. 21 , and she acknowledged the affair , a government official briefed on the matter said .She also voluntarily gave the agency her computer .In a search of it , the agents discovered several classified documents , which raised the additional question of whether Petraeus had given them to her .She said that he had not .Agents interviewed Petraeus the following week .He also admitted to the affair but said he had not given any classified documents to her .The agents then interviewed Broadwell again on Nov. 2 , the official said .Based on that record , law - enforcement officials decided there was no evidence that Petraeus had committed any crime and tentatively ruled out charges coming out of the investigation , the official said .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"64.448395"}

Arlen Specter 's campaign bought thousands of ad minutes on Philadelphia black - oriented radio stations to air a clip of President Obama 's praising him .And Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins made robo - calls to city Democratic voters saying that Specter has \" proven he 's on our team \" by supporting the economic - stimulus and health - care overhaul .For Specter , surviving the Democratic Senate primary against Rep. Joe Sestak may well come down to his hometown , the city that launched his long political career in 1965 , when he was elected district attorney - as a Republican .In a response to President Bush 's weekly radio address yesterday , Democratic congressional candidate Joe Sestak urged the Bush administration to \" speak honestly \" about the true cost of the war in Iraq .Labeling himself an underdog in an increasingly bitter race , U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon ( R. , Pa. ) mounted a furious attack on Democratic opponent Joe Sestak in the pair 's final debate yesterday .\" My opponent can throw out all the crap he wants about my kids , but in the end , the people of this district will decide , \" Weldon told a mostly friendly audience at the Delaware County Chamber of Commerce event .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"65.836174"}

Bush has been virtually silent for his brother Jeb Bush in the 2016 presidential campaign .One would wonder why a former two - term president would be kept in the shadows and not used as leverage in a bitter fight with other candidates who have no presidential connections .With only four days left until the New Hampshire primary , it appears as though Bush 's \" Right to Rise \" Super PAC has decided to bring George W. into the game .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"66.37659"}

{"text":"I. Summary Overview Travelgate is a story about the failure of the Clinton White House to live up to the ethical standards expected of the highest office in the land .The wrongdoing of this administration lies not in the firings of the seven Travel Office employees .They served at the pleasure of the President .If the President chose to fire them to reward political cronies , that was his prerogative .And he must reap the consequences .Rather , the wrongdoing occurred after the firings .It resulted from a desire to hide the truth about who actually fired them and why .The committee spent 3\\1/2\\ years investigating not just who fired them and why , but the wrongdoing that followed .The resulting mosaic pieced together from the facts uncovered reveals the answers the White House refused to disclose .In the end , the actions of the Clinton administration following the firings may have a lasting and damaging impact on the Office of the Presidency .The committee has found that the motive for the firings was political cronyism : the President sought to reward his friend , Harry Thomason , with the spoils of the White House travel business .A pretext for the firings was created , and the trigger was pulled .When the public reacted to the firing with outrage , the roles of the President , First Lady and Thomason were minimized as the White House staff engaged in a colossal damage - control effort .First , it had to portray the victims of the firings as the wrongdoers .This was achieved by White House officials unleashing the full powers of the Federal Government against the seven former workers .The extraordinary might of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice -- not to mention the prestige of the White House itself -- all were brought to bear .These actions constitute a gross abuse of the rights of seven American citizens and their families .Second , an enormous and elaborate cover - up operation , housed in the White House Counsel 's Office , sought to prevent numerous investigations from discovering not only the roles of who fired the workers and why , but also their efforts to persecute the victims .As a result , it is the committee 's view that the White House stands in contempt of its own constitutional responsibilities to faithfully uphold and execute the Constitution and laws of the Nation .Never before has a President and his staff done so much to cover up improper actions and hinder the public 's right to learn the truth .The following chapters reveal the facts that tell this story .Before long , Bill Clinton , who campaigned on the mantra , ' ' I feel your pain , ' ' caused a great deal of pain in the lives of seven career Government employees as well as countless others caught up in the events known as ' 'Travelgate .

{"text":"The above electoral map prediction from Western Illinois University has received a lot of attention , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders , for showing Sanders winning in a landslide .Some argue that we should take this seriously because the mock election model has been right in every election it was used in since 1975 .The catch is that it was only used three times since 1975 .They deserve some credit for correctly predicting victories for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford before many people had heard of Carter , and for predicting the election of Obama when many were ( as with Sanders now ) claiming he was unelectable .While I would love for this to be true , it is also very hard to accept the results in specific states , such as Sanders winning Mississippi and Georgia but losing in Hawaii and Maryland .Of course the claims of being right are limited to the final results and not accuracy of state by state predictions .A victory for Sanders , even if closer and involving a different set of states , would still be welcome .It is easy to dismiss this prediction , and I could not blame either Clinton or the Republicans for denying any meaning to it beyond the enthusiasm of college students for Sanders .The bigger question this year is whether we can believe the conventional polls , especially when they are being used to determine who qualifies for the debates , which can potentially influence the outcome .Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie have been eliminated from Tuesday 's main debate , along with George Pataki and Lindsay Graham being excluded from the undercard debate .Even some pollsters have argued that the polls should not be used in this manner .One problem is that the Republican candidates are too close together to use the polls to separate them .Then there is the question of whether the polls are all that accurate in predicting a primary election well before the vote .I 've followed the Democratic primaries far more closely , and have noted many times how little predictive value the polls have .This polling report from December 2007 described how Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Among the problems with these polls , many voters in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire do not decide until the last minute .People are far more likely to switch between relatively similar members of their own party than they are to switch from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican in a general election .Pollsters also adjust the raw results based upon projections as to who will actually vote , but that is difficult to predict .Some polls this year are basing their prediction upon whether someone voted in previous Democratic primaries , but this excludes the people are who , at least from discussions on line , are saying they have just recently registered to vote Democratic in order to vote for Sanders .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"75.00812"}

{"text":"While it 's unlikely that Tinder outreach would do enough to sway an election , it 's still a very innovative way to get young voters involved .The Name \" Hillary \" Dropped 90 Percent in Popularity While She Was First Lady .Friday , February 5 .By Christine Rousselle .While it 's normal for baby names to fluctuate in popularity over time , a Michigan State PhD student found that the name \" Hillary \" dropped 90 percent in popularity during Hillary Clinton 's tenure as First Lady .While other names of First Ladies experienced a drop as well , the decline in popularity of the name \" Hillary \" was unique in that the name was experiencing a surge prior to Bill Clinton 's election in 1992 .The second - biggest drop in popularity of a First Lady 's name was \" Laura , \" during the eight years of the George W. Bush presidency .When we look at Figure 1 we can see that naming popularity seems to be heavily affected by First Ladies .Most names experienced a steady downward trend in popularity .The name \" Rosalynn \" is an exception as it peaked in popularity during the Carter administration before falling by the end to have risen in popularity once again .The name \" Hillary \" is very unique in this pattern as unlike most names , it was growing rapidly in popularity prior to the Clinton administration .However , early into the Clinton administration the popularity dropped rapidly falling to pre-1980s levels for the name .Except for a small rally in during the 2007/2008 primary campaign against Obama , it has not recovered .While this is certainly quite silly and does n't necessarily mean anything , it 's strange to think about how many American girls could have potentially been named Hillary if Bill Clinton had lost the 1992 election .Analysis : Governors Soar , Rubio Stumbles Early On in Crucial NH Debate .Saturday , February 6 .By Guy Benson .MANCHESTER , NH --In desperate need of a strong showing in New Hampshire , three Republican governors stepped up and won tonight 's debate .Jeb Bush , Chris Christie and John Kasich all turned in outstanding performances , which may disrupt the state of play ahead of Tuesday 's votes .In a cycle that has been notably unkind to governors , these chief executives finally broke through .Marco Rubio , surging out of Iowa , endured a brutal opening segment , getting sliced and diced by Christie .The New Jerseyan attacked Rubio as scripted and untested , which Rubio parried well at first , but then proceeded to repeat almost the same verbatim defense of himself as Christie poked and prodded .With each similar Rubio response , Christie urged the audience to take note of how the Floridian was confirming the knock the governor was advancing .This was Christie the prosecutor , puncturing a reluctant witness on the stand : .A cringeworthy stretch for Rubio .Let 's see if he suffers because of it .I should add that Rubio rebounded quite well later in the program , offering excellent and detailed answers on a host of questions -- particularly in exchanges on ISIS and abortion .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"75.427826"}
