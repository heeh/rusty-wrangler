{"text":"Incredibly , eight states still do not allow public charter schools to exist .That means children assigned to low - performing schools in places such as Birmingham , Alabama , Louisville , Kentucky , and Omaha , Nebraska , are trapped without a choice or a way out .These are n't teacher problems , or student problems .These are policy problems .In far too many states , the laws and policies in place that govern education put up significant barriers to higher student achievement .In fact , according to a first - of - its - kind report card that we published this week , nearly 90 % of states earned less than a \" C \" grade on the subject of education policy .Ours is a new type of education report card that does n't look at teacher performance or students ' test scores , but instead focuses solely on the laws in place determining how our schools are allowed to operate .StudentsFirst will publish it annually , and this year no state earned higher than a B - minus .That ought to shock parents , educators , and lawmakers alike .It indicates that no matter how hard our children study , and no matter how much passion teachers pour into their classrooms , the rules and regulations governing education are holding schools back .There is no shortage of effective educators and innovators in our country .However , they are currently forced to operate in a bureaucratic , out - of - date environment .That 's why StudentsFirst 's singular mission moving forward is to shape policy and help pass laws at the state level .It is clear there are three key policy areas - call them pillars - upon which a solid education system must be built .First , the teaching profession must be elevated .That means using meaningful evaluations of teachers and administrators in making personnel decisions , ensuring teachers are paid as professionals , and providing alternative means of getting qualified instructors certified and into classrooms .Second , parents must be empowered with meaningful information and choice .And third , transparency is necessary to ensure that education funding is being spent wisely and school districts are governed properly .We hope the report cards provide a wake - up call .They can serve as roadmaps for policymakers to use in creating the kind of environments that prioritize students ' interests and give educators the tools to improve student achievement .The report cards also provide reason for optimism .Florida , for example , is setting an example - beginning with a strong foundation for reform built by Governor Jeb Bush and continuing today , under Governor Rick Scott - by bringing more rigor and accountability into its school system .The changes are paying off ; Florida students recently outperformed a majority of the country and the world in an internationally benchmarked test .Tennessee has also seen student achievement rise following the enactment of student - focused reforms there .Some states have also shown that reform does n't require an incremental , years - long process .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"81.11993"}

{"text":"The following article originally ran on October 24 , 2006 .In light of recent events , President Bush organized a summit on school safety .Of course , the reason these events make the news is because they are in actuality not that common once you consider how many shootings have taken place relative to the number of schools there are in this country .For example , in 2006 there have been only four incidents with guns at school .Basically , schools are safe places for children ; they are more likely to die violent deaths at other locations .So , while I agree that we do n't want to have a knee - jerk reaction to certain events , the real issue that must be addressed is why schools are not allowed to protect themselves from psychotic or evil people .According to John R. Lott , Jr. , Ph.D. economist and author of More Guns , Less Crime and The Bias Against Guns , banning guns might seem to be the logical way to keep children safe in school .However , he uses a simple analogy : .Would you feel safe putting a sign in front of your home saying , \" This home is a gun - free zone \" ?Law - abiding citizens might be pleased by such a sign , but to criminals it would be an invitation .Lott points out that in 1985 , only eight states had right - to - carry laws - laws that allow a person to automatically get a permit , provided he passes a background check and completed a training course .Today there are forty states that have some version of these laws .Lott 's examination of the data showed that \" from 1977 to 1999 , states that adopted right - to - carry laws experienced a 60 % drop in the rates at which the attacks occur and a 78 % drop in the rates at which people are killed from such attacks . \"Moreover , he points out that before 1995 , it was possible for teachers to bring guns to campus in many states and that \" the rash of student shootings at schools began in October 1997 in Pearl , Mississippi after the ban , \" ( my italics ) .Israel and Thailand have been cited as examples of how guns in schools can save lives .In fact , Rep. Frank Lasee ( Republican ) of Wisconsin plans to introduce legislation to allow teachers and administrators to carry guns here in the United States .Undoubtedly , liberal Democrats and Republicans will not support such legislation , arguing that guns are too extreme a measure to take .Some more conservative politicians will probably propose legislation mandating that all local governments provide a police presence at all schools in the country .But , if providing education is supposedly a government duty and teachers at public schools are agents of the government , why ca n't they be trained to carry a gun to protect the children the state has placed under them ?The question here is whether or not properly trained teachers and administrators should have the freedom to bring a weapon to campus - to act as extensions of law enforcement on school campuses .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"84.737"}

{"text":"\" Connecticut has a relatively new bullying law for schools that all bullying incidents must be reported to the state .According to the legislator who wrote the bill it was not being used .A relative was being physically injured in Kindergarten including being choked and put in head locks and being kicked in the stomach and punched .The victim knows martial arts but felt bound by the code of ethics to not use it in school to defend himself .The teacher was aware but nothing was being done to punish the bully or stop future attacks from happening , it repeated over and over , in the class and at recess .Finally it escalated to the principal and the parent asked if bully reports had been filed to the state and what was being done about the bully .The parent pushed the envelope , still nothing was done .The next week the victim was playing at recess with is friend from martial arts class .They were playing around with moves from class , faking moves and sometimes lightly touching to block hits , and were alone ( not with anyone else ) and laughing .The Assistant Principal saw it and yelled at the kids , then phoned the father threatening to do a bully report on his son saying \" that is what you wanted last week , for us to report to the state \" .This was clearly a power play game for the school staff and not centered at all on student safety .To boot the ' victim ' child has a learning disability anxiety disorder that already affects his ability to trust and communicate with the adult workers at school and to speak up for himself to other students .Incidents when teachers do n't help the victim of bullying and when being yelled at for nothing done wrong does not help the child feel he can trust the adults at school .The parent is now having detailed discussions of which parts of the marital arts moves the boy should use on the bully to make him stop but not hurt him too badly for self - defense acts .The boy is struggling with ethics still due to what the martial arts teacher says in class .These adults in schools who have charge of kids do not seem able to use good judgement .They look the other way for real incidents yet seem to like to over - punish the things that do n't have any real negative consequences ( toy guns , squirt guns , typical boy roughhousing when kids are happy , candy , etc . ) .I feel this is due to the coward mentality .In other words the adults do wish that all things were good and right ( no violence , no bullying , safe environment ) but it is hard to confront the real issues when they happen but easier to overreact to stupid non - issues .Cowards have an easier time , for example , making a mountain out of a molehill to complain about it rather than doing the hard thing and really addressing the problem face to face .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"87.29164"}

Lopez ) because it violated the limits of the Commerce Clause in the Constitution .Legislation stills makes it illegal to have a gun within 1,000 feet of a school .Finally , educators can play a part in prevention by creating an environment where students feel comfortable telling an adult whenever they hear about someone who is considering doing harm to another person , or even whether the people are considering harming themselves .Once such an environment is created , it will remain important that the adults in that environment listen to students and handle the information they receive in a fair and responsible manner .So there we have it : the government that is supposed to protect people ends up only recommending a gauzy \" environment \" in which everyone is supposed to feel special and listened to .Instead of protection , we get therapy .People respond to incentives .Economic analysis can be applied to criminal behavior .People choose to do more of something when the cost is low and choose to do less of something when the cost goes up .Why does this logic suddenly fall apart when we are talking about degenerate , cowardly adults or students who want to commit murder ?They too might think twice if they knew they could be stopped .The situation becomes more infuriating when it comes to private schools .Why private institutions are not allowed to determine their own safety policies is a clear violation of property rights by the government .Let the voluntary decisions of individual schools and parents ( consumers ) decide if children should be in the presence of teachers with guns .After all , do n't parents have the right to take care of their children in the manner they see fit ?I can hear the objection : \" What if a teacher is psychotic and decides to shoot all his students ?\" I am perplexed when I hear that same argument being used against allowing airlines to arm their pilots ( and , hence , protect their own private property ) .If a pilot has mental issues , ca n't he fly me into the ground and kill me if he wants to already ?In fact , I would rather he put me out of my misery with a gunshot to the head then allow me to think about my impending death as he nosedives into the Earth .My point is if a teacher is emotionally unstable , there is nothing that prevents him from bringing a gun to campus and committing his cowardly , pathetic act now .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"91.883575"}
{"text":"More and more people are speaking up and the public is catching on to the failure of test , test , test .The momentum is growing .Time is running out .John Thompson , widely published writer , historian and teacher , wrote this post for the blog .Secretary of Education Arne Duncan obviously knew what he was doing when he timed the USDOE revocation of Oklahoma 's NCLB Waiver on the proverbial \" take out the trash day , \" just before the long Labor Day weekend .One Duncan soundbite is that Common Core is not a top down corporate and/or federal mandate , but he does n't want to call national attention to his own repudiation of that claim .It is now impossible for anyone to believe Duncan 's spin after he punished Oklahoma for repealing its standards and tests .Neither can Duncan deny anymore that his policies are about reward and punish .In its letter informing Oklahoma that it must return , this year , to the discredited NCLB accountability regime , the USDOE admits that it is imposing a policy that \" is neither simple nor desirable . \"Technically , Duncan did not punish the teachers and students of Oklahoma because the state yielded to bipartisan grassroots pressure and rejected Common Core .It did not even throw our underfunded and overwhelmed schools into another mess , at the beginning of the school year , because Oklahoma rejected college - readiness standards .Oklahoma has long had such standards , known as PASS , and those widely praised standards are again in place .Despite the dubious nature of the legal authority that he claims , Duncan threw our schools into turmoil because Oklahoma did not meet his schedule for proving that our democratically enacted standards meet his standards .The USDOE had given Oklahoma sixty days to prove that its standards are college ready .The Oklahoma State Regents was tasked with determining that a student who met those high school standards would not require remediation in college .The Regents apparently was on schedule to ratify or not ratify that status by October .In other words , Secretary Duncan remains consistent in not only demanding that all states , schools , and teachers toe the line , but that they remain on his timetable when implementing everything on his corporate reform wish list .Duncan tipped his hand when Oklahoma repealed Common Core , snidely commenting on the state 's high college remediation rate .Clearly Duncan believes the failure to produce college ready students was linked to our failure to see the wisdom of Common Core .It could n't be due to generations of poverty , an out - of - control incarceration rate ( especially of mothers , ) lack of access to health care for children and families , or our incredibly low per student spending ( of about $ 8000 per student . )Our shortcomings were not due to education budget cuts of 22 % , more than any other state .Neither could our high remediation rate be attributable to what we are doing right .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"92.000015"}

{"text":"Are Teacher Colleges Turning out Mediocrity ?By Gilbert Cruz , Friday , Oct. 23 , 2009 .There has been a mantra of sorts going around education circles over the past few years : \" Nothing matters more to a child 's education than good teachers .\" Anyone who 's ever had a Ms. Green or a Mr. Miller whom they remember fondly instinctively knows this to be true .And while \" Who 's teaching my kid ? \" is an important question for parents to ask , there may be an equally essential ( and rarely remarked upon ) question - \" Who 's teaching my kid 's teachers ? \"On Thursday , Secretary of Education Arne Duncan went to Columbia University 's Teachers College , the oldest teacher - training school in the nation , and delivered a speech blasting the education schools that have trained the majority of the 3.2 million teachers working in U.S. public schools today .It was a damning , but not unprecedented , assessment of teacher colleges , which have long been the stepchildren of the American university system and a frequent target of education reformers ' scorn over the past quarter - century .( See pictures of the college dorm 's evolution . )But Duncan 's speech raises another question : If most teacher colleges are \" mediocre , \" does that mean the teachers they produce are equally lackluster ?One of the major problems with answering that question , says David Steiner , New York 's education commissioner , is that we simply do n't know , ca n't know .It is nearly impossible in many states to tell which teachers produce the best student outcomes , let alone which teacher colleges . \"And if we ca n't identify the skills that make a difference in terms of student learning , then what we 're saying is that teaching is an undefinable art , as opposed to something that can be taught , \" says Steiner .Until recently , Steiner served as dean of Hunter College 's School of Education , where he was a vocal critic of the typical ed - school approach , in which teachers - in - training study theories and philosophies of education at the expense of practical , in - the - classroom experience .Steiner maintains that institutions need to turn their eyes toward the practical and away from the hypothetical .( See pictures of a public boarding school . )Which brings people like Steiner to a central concern : What good are teachers ' credentials if we ca n't tell how much their students are learning ?To that end , Duncan said , \" I am urging every teacher - education program today to make better outcomes for students the overarching mission that propels all their efforts . \"( See TIME 's special report on paying for college . )\" If you want to get more - effective teachers , one of the obvious places to begin is to look at the supply side , \" says George Noell , a researcher at Louisiana State University who has worked for several years on the state 's Teacher Quality initiative .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"92.91635"}

{"text":"EPA head Lisa Jackson to step down .Led push to enforce the Clean Air Act by dropping carbon emissions .News outlets are reporting that Lisa Jackson , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , will not return for the second term of the Obama administration .Jackson will probably be remembered as the point person for the first US attempts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions .It was n't necessarily a position that she - or Obama - chose .But partisan gridlock ensured that there would be no legislation addressing emissions , and Jackson inherited a Supreme Court decision from the Bush administration that indicated the Clean Air Act required some sort of action .Within months of the inauguration , Jackson 's EPA used Bush - era research to issue an endangerment finding on greenhouse gasses .Three years later , that finding led to the first limits imposed on carbon dioxide emissions by large sources , limits that would severely curtail the construction of new coal plants .By the time they were issued , however , a sharp fall in the price of natural gas was already doing more to limit the use of coal than any EPA regulation could .( Fracking , which led to the plunge in prices , was also the subject of some initial EPA oversight . )Under Jackson 's leadership , the EPA also negotiated with automakers to finalize a deal that was first cut as part of the auto bailout package .That agreement will cut carbon emissions by increasing the average fuel economy of cars sold in the US , and it marked the first time that such standards were raised in 20 years .Whoever replaces Jackson will likely face a very different set of challenges .Most of the big decisions appear to have been made , but the lawsuits that will attempt to keep them from taking effect are probably just getting started .I usually defer to states on such matters but when one state 's policies can drastically affect the neighboring states I think we need some form of Federal oversight .For example , companies that can dump into the river or ocean in one state and then detrimentally affect the living conditions of people in the other .We do n't need the EPA .Each state is fully capable of setting their own environmental regulations .Because air , rivers , lakes , and groundwater all respect state boundaries .Plus there 's nothing carmakers love more than tailoring their product to the differing demands of every state .And it 's not as though electrical grids cross state lines , right ?I usually defer to states on such matters but when one state 's policies can drastically affect the neighboring states I think we need some form of Federal oversight .For example , companies that can dump into the river or ocean in one state and then detrimentally affect the living conditions of people in the other .That 's when a state sues that company into bankruptcy .You make it sound like states who are hurt by careless companies do n't have any kind of recourse .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"129.55653"}
