Public to have it .So ... .Socratic question # 2 : You agree that it is better to know .And yet in a previous paragraph you asked me how it 's better to know the truth , and accuse me of perspective borne of ideology not fact .How do you reconcile this ?Easily .I have stated before that the public is still at the whim of the decisions that their elected officials make which is often times decided upon through corporate interaction .Knowing the truth , from the perspective of the majority populace does not necessitate that corrective action will occur .I can say peace and love all day , referencing my environment , but I am not actually describing my environment .The debate topic is not centered upon the ideological mission of WikiLeaks it is upon whether or not WikiLeaks is doing more harm than good .I am referring to the idea that an instance or two of catching wrong doing does not necessarily reflect the entirety of our system nor does it necessarily reflect the aspects of the system that has resulted in these behaviours and actions .The ' greater problem ' is how the population is informed and how that information is spun into partisan arguments resulting in constant argument while these instances continue to occur .It is more relevant , in my opinion , to focus on the populace and how they have historically reacted to scandal and as well take a look at how our elected officials and other leaders have dealt with the same .Save for a few aspects of our system , such as Supreme Court Appointees , our leadership is a revolving door .There is a laundry list of scandal in America alone , known and unknown , and while these issues are best known the result is just another person to fill in the shoes of the publicly shamed .The same lobbying efforts occur , wargames are still played , assumptions on what is best for our nation is constantly being influenced by presumed threats , real or unreal .This will always be the case but the process that our elected officials utilize in their campaigns are centered on basic rhetoric that assumes what is best for the average citizen - assumptions which differ depending on party , religion and so forth .WikiLeaks has been played by the media to this extent , providing information to the public based on terrorist assumptions and extending that accusation to Assange and his organization .WikiLeaks is not benefiting the public because WikiLeaks will never have full access to the attention of the full public and as of current there is no real expression from WikiLeaks save for leaked documents .Which allows for the partisan media to spin it and divert attention .As a result , inadvertently as it may be , WikiLeaks is perpetuating the partisan divide inherent in the pre - WikiLeaks media .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"72.5805"}
