Anderson ?There 's no time for a criminal history on the name , of course .Did McEvoy know shots had been fired ?Maybe he heard the shots fired inside the townhouse as he approached , and decided in an act of bravery to go in before back - up officers arrived .So how much did officer Michael McEvoy know as he was walking up to the townhouse ?Usually we could rely on recorded radio traffic , but ... .Multi - Million Radio System 's Recorder Fails The radio communications , that are supposed to be recorded , failed during the incident .According to NWCDS Assistant Technical Services Director Pat Dollard , the recording system went offline at 10:45 a.m. Dec. 12 , 2013 .Also according to NWCDS , the malfunction was not noticed until late at night after McEvoy was shot .The recorder was n't functioning again until the early morning hours of December 13 , 2013 .What is remarkable is that NWCDS only has one point in the system that records their radio communications audio , and that the Arlington Heights Police Department did n't have any redundant system so they could replay their radio communications independently of the 9 - 1 - 1 center .NWCDS has had numerous failures with their new multi - million dollar radio system , which went online on June 5 , 2013 .NWCDS has also had numerous failures with their Computer - Aided Dispatch System ( CAD ) .It is remarkable that designers and administrators have not worked on redundancy in their system to assure that critical functions are available .However , on June 5 , 2013 , when police switched to a multi - million dollar radio system from Motorola , they switched on military - grade encryption which prevents scanners from monitoring public safety communications in most of the northwest suburbs .Because of the actions of NWCDS and the Executive Committee decisions , there is no record of the radio communications of this extremely important and critical event .The integrity of NWCDS is in question .There should always be checks in government to validate that an agency is performing as expected .It is reprehensible that there is no radio communication recording of the incident , especially since police radio communications were secured from public monitoring less than one year ago .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"91.26218"}

Assigning command and control functions under the ATF 's National Response Plan [ edit ] .The decision to designate Chojnacki as incident commander and Sarabyn as tactical commander was mandated under the ATF 's National Response Plan .Chojnacki was selected as incident commander because he was the special agent in charge of the field office in whose region the raid was to occur .While the special agent in charge of a geographic area may have a great interest in an operation that takes place in his area , his position has little bearing on his qualification to run the operation .And even though Chojnacki had 27 years of law enforcement experience , there were other agents involved in the raid who possessed substantially more experience in tactical operations .Chojnacki , in turn , appointed Sarabyn , to be tactical coordinator because the National Response Plan required that position to be filled by an assistant special agent in charge who had completed special response team ( SRT ) training , as had Sarabyn .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"92.028465"}

{"text":"Finally , it works even in confined spaces .You do n't need much room ; just crash into him and then immediately initiate the next step .Counterattack - We all know how to draw our duty guns .Unlike disarming techniques , it is n't a complex skill reserved for close - range threats , but something we have been doing since our first day at the range .The counterattack puts this skill to use .As you move inside , draw as rapidly as possible , bring your gun up close to his body and keep shooting until he ceases to be a threat .It should be mentioned , however , that there is a slim chance that the slide will be pushed out of battery if the muzzle is shoved too hard into his body , which temporarily disables the gun .So be ready to eliminate this problem by backing the muzzle away slightly if the gun does n't fire .( For more on this , see George T. Williams ' excellent article , \" Real World Contact Shots , \" in the January / February 2006 issue of The Police Marksman magazine ) .Gunfire is n't the only option for the counterattack .In some cases , a disarming technique may be applicable or even preferable .In others , eye jabs , throat strikes , etc . may disable or stun your attacker to the point that he can be disarmed .Because of the increased range of options provided by these techniques , officers who have made the effort to adequately develop them have a definite advantage in close combat .Keep Pressing the Attack - Your assailant will almost certainly back away instinctively as you move in on him , so be ready for it .Keep moving into him , and keep up your counterattack until he is no longer a threat .These principles are easy to remember and simple to apply , but that does n't mean training is n't necessary .Like any other skill , close combat skills should be practiced on a regular basis , preferably in dynamic one - on - one exercises .One word of caution - this training entails dynamic , rapid movement , making it dangerous with live ammunition .Drills should be done with Simunitions , AirSoft or nonfunctioning training guns .These drills can also be practiced on your own with safe weapons , and/or reinforced through mental imagery .The draw is especially important here .It must be quick , sure and solid to ensure the quickest possible deployment .Unfortunately , some officers neglect this aspect of firearms training .They do n't practice , or they cheat themselves by leaving their holsters unsnapped during firearms training , which can have devastating results on the street .Practice your draw , and always draw from a fully secured holster during training .Finally , awareness is crucial , because even the best countermeasures lose their effectiveness if we are n't mentally prepared to use them .Keep in mind that close range attacks can happen any time .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"92.85892"}

{"text":"One of the reasons suspicious person calls are so dangerous is because there normally is n't much information and the danger signs are usually quite vague .While there may be enough information to cause concern , there is seldom enough to be sure about the risks , leaving us ambiguous about how to approach the situation and leading to decisions which may put us at greater risk than originally anticipated .In this case , the officers understandably choose to approach Garcia in a low profile manner .In retrospect , it becomes clear that he should have been taken down at gunpoint .When assessing the risks of a suspicious person call , remember most people are reluctant to call the police .They do n't want to bother law enforcement if it looks like their fears are unwarranted .Therefore , they often wait until they are reasonably certain that something is wrong before they call .In addition , most citizens are intimately familiar with the businesses , people and circumstances in their neighborhoods , and have a good idea about what is suspicious and what is not .Because of these factors , we should always take suspicious persons calls seriously .The safest approach is to assume there was a good reason for the call and know that we may be walking into a dangerous situation .Similarly , suspicious persons and circumstances that you observe on your own should be considered potentially dangerous .If they catch your attention , there is probably a good reason for it .Even if you ca n't put your finger on what aroused your suspicious , you must assume that your instincts are correct .What we call gut instinct comes from subtle clues perceived only at the subconscious level , and communicated to our conscious mind as a feeling .We may not know why , but we know something is wrong .Rather than ignore the feeling , or try to explain it away , we should use it as a trigger to raise our awareness and prepare us to take action .When responding to a suspicious person call , remember appearances may be deceiving and we may have very little information to go on .We must slow down , assess the situation thoroughly , plan our actions carefully and approach with caution .Tactics Another reason suspicious person calls are difficult to handle is because although the risks are significant , high - risk tactics may not be justified .Unless we detect something that makes it obvious that danger is present , we have to use low - profile tactics .So many variables are involved in these calls , making it difficult to develop universal procedures to apply to every situation .Still , there are basic principles that apply to most , like slowing down , gathering as much intelligence as possible before making contact , keeping your guard up , using backup and when possible , ordering the subject to come to you .Beyond that , we must remain flexible and open minded about our options so we can quickly adapt to the situation .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"95.609344"}

{"text":"Do Something !Detective Bertalotto 's counterattack was n't perfect , but it got the job done .It prevented him from taking multiple hits to center mass and enabled him to drag his assailant to the floor , thereby disrupting the attack until Evans and Yates could come to his aid .The critical point is that he did something .Doing something is always better than doing nothing .Even if it is n't exactly right , it will usually catch your assailant off guard and force him to rethink his game plan .This buys you time and puts him on the defensive , giving you a psychological advantage .Bertalotto did n't just stand there and take hits .He did something , and in so doing provided us an outstanding example of how to fight back and win , even when the odds are against us .Backup Suspects We should consider the role that Hernandez and Ramos might have played in this incident .They were in a good position to move in behind the officers without being seen and launch an attack from the rear .Fortunately , this did n't happen , apparently because the pair did n't have the stomach for a fight , but the officers were vulnerable to an unexpected attack from an unseen threat .This fact highlights the danger posed by backup accomplices on holdup teams .In this case , the officers were told that there was no holdup while still en route to the call , which explains why they were n't concerned about peripheral threats .Still , considering the fact that suspicious person calls are so dangerous , we ca n't discount any risks , including the possibility of peripheral threats .Whether responding to a holdup alarm , a suspicious person call , or any other high - risk call , we must take the time to consider and watch for this potential hazard .Body Armor Like most plainclothes officers , Detective Bertalotto rarely wore body armor .Admittedly , it 's not very comfortable , it does n't blend in well with civilian attire and many plainclothes officers feel like their job is n't dangerous enough to justify its use .Unlike uniformed officers , many believe they are unlikely to encounter violence without warning .Instead , they believe the nature of their job allows them to anticipate potentially violent encounters far enough in advance to don their vests prior to the danger .Although this is normally true , violent encounters often occur when least expected regardless of our assignment .Detective Bertalotto was on his way to lunch with no plans to become involved in any police action at all .However , he ended up going into a high - risk situation without the benefit of a vest .Even though the wound to his stomach was n't particularly serious , it easily could have been .If he had been a split second slower in responding to Garcia 's attack , or if the bullet had entered at a slightly different angle , it could have been fatal .Similarly , if it had not been for Evans and Yates ' intervention , there is a good chance that Bertalotto would have been shot several times in the back when Garcia tried to execute him on the floor .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"104.45734"}

{"text":"My take .So why did I cover this story in past blog posts , and why am I bringing up the retraction now ?Well , it 's because of the feminist agenda .I want to point out how the feminist left uses stories like this in order to push a wedge between men and women .Women who are indoctrinated for four years in misandry are less likely to look to men as protectors , providers and moral / spiritual leaders .Marriage , with its traditional gender roles of men working and woman raising the kids , will be out .If men are all rapists , then how could a woman give up her own dreams and career to stay home and raise kids ?If men are all rapists , how could a woman trust a man to be faithful to her ?If men are all rapists , then how could a man be trusted to provide for a family .If men are all rapists , then how could a woman trust a man to stick around when she is old and wrinkly ?And of course , this lousy impression of men is all reinforced by the binge - drinking , hooking - up , and serial cohabitation that is so popular in university campuses .There is a reason why Rolling Stone ran with this story , despite all the warning signs - it made the point that they wanted to make .Women who think that they ca n't depend on men will naturally turn to bigger government to provide for them , and that 's what people on the left want women to do .Marriage is subversive to their plan .Having a lot of children is subversive to their plan .Homeschooling is subversive to their plan .It was 1 a.m. on a Saturday when the call came .A friend , a University of Virginia freshman who earlier said she had a date that evening with a handsome junior from her chemistry class , was in hysterics .Something bad had happened .Arriving at her side , three students -\"Randall , \" \" Andy \" and \" Cindy , \" as they were identified in an explosive Rolling Stone account - told The Washington Post that they found their friend in tears .Jackie appeared traumatized , saying her date ended horrifically , with the older student parking his car at his fraternity , asking her to come inside and then forcing her to perform oral sex on five men .In their first interviews about the events of that September 2012 night , the three friends separately told The Post that their recollections of the encounter diverge from how Rolling Stone portrayed the incident in a storyabout Jackie 's alleged gang rape at a U - Va . fraternity .The interviews also provide a richer account of Jackie 's interactions immediately after the alleged attack and suggest that the friends are skeptical of her account .The scene with her friends was pivotal in the article , as it alleged that the friends were callously apathetic about a beaten , bloodied , injured classmate reporting a brutal gang rape at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"105.01825"}

{"text":"Despite all their twisting and pounding , the feminists have convinced only their devotees that false rape claims are a \" myth .\" The rest of us ai n't buying it .News account after news account posit a mind - numbing cavalcade of false rape reports and support the objectively verifiable figures showing that false rape claims are a real and significant problem .What is also true is that in case after case , police bemoan the effect that false accusations have on real rape victims : real rape victims are less likely to be believed because of false claims .Since they are less likely to be believed , they are less likely to come forward .This is common sense : it is difficult to get the public to presume the validity of a rape claim when injustices to innocent men are common .So what is the solution ?The radical feminists ' solution is to put their heads in the sand and keep on pretending that false rape claims are a \" myth \" and that women are essentially incapable of lying about rape .And we should teach them that false rape claims are a crime that may be punished by jail time .If we could eradicate false rape claims or render them a de minimis problem , we would wrap real rape claims in a cloak of presumed validity .If women hardly ever lied about rape , the claims of real rape victims would be afforded greater respect , more victims would come forward , fewer innocent men would be unjustly deprived of their liberty , and more rapists would be imprisoned .This logic is unassailable .The only thing standing in the way is that in the area of rape , common sense is trumped by a radical left political agenda .Behind every false rape claim , there is generally some motivation .In many of the news accounts , such as the one below , the motivations are not stated .But this much is clear : in many if not most of these cases , young women tell lies that they do n't intend to spiral out of control .They do n't intend to hurt a specific male by crying rape , and name only an unspecified , phantom male .But sometimes their lies do spiral out of control and hurt innocent men and boys , not to mention real rape victims whose cries are viewed with a jaundiced eye because of such lies .It would be helpful if young people were educated about the dangers of false rape claims -- about how seemingly little white lies can spiral out of control , mainly because the police invariably take rape claims very seriously and sometimes nab an innocent man .Sadly , sexual assault counselors are content to deny that false rape claims even exist and so are unlikely to help spearhead any effort to educate our young people about them .That effort must fall to people like us who do take such claims seriously .Erica Ansley Emmett of Cartersville was arrested in Bartow County for allegedly lying to investigators about a recently reported sex crime and theft .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"109.360054"}

{"text":"But is a polygraph more stressful to a rape accuser than a stint in jail is to an innocent man falsely accused ?The question scarcely survives its statement .And if you do n't think it 's common that innocent men are jailed for rapes they did n't commit , spend several hours reading this Web site to see the actual news accounts of that very thing happening .And then read the objective sources that place false rape claims anywhere from nine to more likely closer to fifty percent .If a polygraph would keep an innocent man from languishing in jail , we should not exempt rape accusers from polygraph tests .That is really the bottom line .( Some radical feminists do not agree with that , which tells us everything we need to know about their vile agenda . )The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , for example , has upheld the use of polygraphs for this purpose , saying that polygraph testing \" produces an incentive to tell the truth , and thereby advances the sentencing goals .\" The vast majority of states require polygraphs for use when it comes to sex offenders .Thus , polygraphs are perfectly acceptable when used on men who want to avoid a vile sex charge .Do you see the pattern here ?Let 's spell it out : .Polygraphs : good , when men are asked to take them to help law enforcement officials discern if they 've committed a vile sex crime ; .Polygraphs : bad , when women are asked to take them to help law enforcement officials discern if they are lying about being victimized by a man 's alleged vile sex crime .This is a gross and intellectually dishonest double standard .No rationale justifies exempting rape accusers from submitting to polygraphs .Such exemption only serves to exalt the radical feminist agenda to jack up rape convictions over any concern for innocent men falsely accused of rape .But that , after is , is really the entire purpose of this immoral , politically driven double double standard , is n't it ?In the news stories below , a college student lied that she had been raped .The reactions to this revelation are most interesting : .The Dean of Students made a refreshing statement one rarely hears in these situations : that he is grateful that no rape occurred .Does anyone ever recall hearing a sexual assault counselor or a radical feminist say that ?For example , after it turned out the Duke Lacrosse accuser lied ?In fact , the reaction after the Duke lacrosse players were declared \" innocent \" by the state 's attorney general ( his word , not mine ) was exactly the opposite -- anger and disappointment .Think about that : some radical feminists apparently would have preferred the accuser to have been brutally raped ( or , more likely , to have her lie go undetected ) as opposed to having the three young men declared \" innocent , \" as occurred .Three totally innocent young men were released from a year - long hell , and the only thing that some radical feminists could muster was to angrily declare that \" something must have happened \" the night of the alleged rape .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"116.851"}

{"text":"In addition to rape and death threats , the messages described Eramo as a \" wretched rape apologist \" and \" a disgusting , worthless piece of trash \" who should \" burn in hell forever . \" Yes , that 's what we call \" radical feminism \" .The whole point of radical feminism is to tell lies and make fake statistics to make women look like victims , and men look like evil brutes .Then the government steps in and fixes everything , e.g. - giving women free birth control pills .And that 's why feminists vote for bigger and bigger government , because they have been told , through these myths and fake statistics , that they are victims .This is the same big government , by the way , that is now going to war with freedom of speech and freedom of religion .Should Christians care about puncturing the myths that cause people to vote for the big government that comes after us ?We better start making the connections and getting in the game now , before it 's too late .We as Christians really need to consider why people are voting for the bigger secular government that turns around and trashes our liberties , for example , with the Hobby Lobby case and the mandate that companies pay for drugs that cause abortions .If you do n't want Christian - owned companies to be forced to do bad things , then understand that you have to counter the reasons why non - Christians vote for bigger government .If it 's global warming , you have to defeat that .If it 's higher minimum wage , you have to defeat that .If you want your religious liberty , your right to work , your right to keep what you earn , then you 'd better start connecting the dots and confronting the people around you .Christians , we can not absorb doctrines like radical feminism into our worldview , we have to fight against it by telling the truth .The Wall Street Journal reports on the conclusion to this radical - feminist scandal .I 'll explain later why I am writing about this , too .Excerpt : .Rolling Stone retracted an explosive article detailing an alleged gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity after Columbia University 's Graduate School of Journalism concluded that the story was a \" journalistic failure that was avoidable . \"The Rolling Stone story was written by Sabrina Rubin Erdely and published last November under the headline \" A Rape on Campus .\" It sparked a national uproar over sexual misconduct at college campuses .At UVA , President Teresa Sullivan suspended all Greek activities for six weeks and students marched in protest .But before long , other media reports raised serious doubts about the veracity of the article and the reporting and editing process behind it .[ ... ]The \" most consequential \" decision , the report found , was Rolling Stone 's acquiescence to the fact that Ms. Erdely \" had not contacted the three friends who spoke with Jackie on the night she said she was raped .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"130.61441"}
