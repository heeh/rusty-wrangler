McDonald of Colorado in 1907 .Two years later , Tammany Hall man Timothy Sullivan introduced a successful bill in the New York state legislature to make Columbus Day a state holiday .By 1910 , 15 states had officially adopted the holiday .Over time , many more states followed suit , and in 1934 Congress made Columbus Day an official holiday of the United States , to be celebrated annually on October 12 .As a result of the Uniform Monday Holiday Act , which became effective in 1971 , Columbus Day is now observed on the second Monday in October each year .While the Columbus Day celebrations of the nineteenth century were often resisted because of their association with Catholicism and immigration , resistance to the celebration today has emerged on altogether different grounds .Renewed attention has been given to the darker aspects of the explorer 's journeys , including the enslavement and maltreatment of natives , the diseases that the Europeans brought with them to the New World , and the opening of the Atlantic slave trade .As a result of the contention surrounding Columbus 's legacy , some states have chosen either to celebrate alternatives to Columbus Day , or to not observe it at all .Hawaii does not recognize Columbus Day , instead celebrating Discoverers ' Day , commemorating the Polynesian discoverers of Hawaii .South Dakota likewise does not recognize Columbus Day , celebrating instead an official state holiday known as Native American Day .In addition to these states , some counties and cities throughout the country have opted to celebrate October 12 as \" Indigenous People 's Day \" or \" Native American Day , \" rather than Columbus Day .Perhaps somewhere between the false dichotomies of Columbus as either hero or villain , the real Christopher Columbus - human , adventurous , imperfect - can be found .As the historian Felipe Fernández - Armesto notes , the answer to whether Columbus was saint or criminal \" is that he was neither but has become both .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"49.928627"}

In 956 , famed Islamic historian , Abul Hasan Ali Ibn Al Masudi , created a map from his research of this journey that depicts an unknown landmass where America is located .Other voyages to the New World chronicled in Muslim histories includes that of Ibn Farrukh , who seems to have visited islands far to the west of the Canaries in 999 C.E. .Proponents of the Muslim exploration theory repeatedly turn to an intriguing map drawn in the early 16th century by the famous cartographer , Piri Reis .Reportedly copying from ancient documents found in a Turkish library , it is widely accepted that Reis created the map in 1513 .Even though this is after Columbus \" discovered \" the New World , the Piri Reis map depicts the accurate placement of islands and landmasses far before they were visited and mapped by Europeans .In fact , it shows the Andes Mountain range , which was not \" discovered \" by Pizarro until 1527 .In his controversial book , 1421 :The Year China Discovered the World , Gavin Menzies theorized that the great Chinese admiral , Zheng He , commanded an immense fleet that spread across all of the world 's oceans on voyages of discovery between 1421 and 1423 .It is well accepted that Zheng He was a great admiral of the Ming Dynasty and , between 1405 and 1433 , orchestrated at least seven massive naval expeditions to explore the Indian Ocean , as well as the seas of Southeast and South Asia .Intending to extend the power of the Ming Empire across the known world , the fleet established trade throughout Southeast Asia , India , Arabia and the Somali Peninsula .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"59.605537"}

{"text":"Contrary to popular belief , not only did Columbus realize the world was round , so did his contemporaries .In fact , it was so well accepted that daring seafarers had been exploring the Atlantic for hundreds of years before Columbus ' time .Without a doubt , men of the early Renaissance knew the world was round , and that the Nina , the Pinta and the Santa Maria were in no danger of sailing over the edge .The ancients were well aware the world was a sphere .Pythagoras ( 6th century B.C. ) is generally credited with having first suggested a round Earth .Aristotle ( 4th century B.C. ) agreed and supported the theory with observations such as that the southern constellations rise higher in the sky when a person travels south .He also noted that during a lunar eclipse , the Earth 's shadow is round .Eratosthenes ( 3rd century B.C. , head librarian at the Library of Alexandria ) built on their ideas and calculated the circumference of the Earth with remarkable accuracy at about 252,000 stadia .Later , the Roman Ptolemy added to the collected wisdom .He observed that as a man approached a far off mountain , it appeared to grow out of the ground - a clear indication of a curved surface .He later devised the forerunner of modern - day longitude and latitude , including measuring what we now call latitude from the equator .In Christian medieval Europe , Bede ( 7th century C.E. ) , a scholar and a Catholic monk , produced an influential treatise that included a discussion of the spherical nature of the world .This work , The Reckoning of Time , was copied and distributed to clerics across the Carolingian empire .Later , in the 1300s , Dante Alighieri 's Divine Comedy also describes the Earth as a sphere .The Catholics were n't the only religious sect that thought the world was round .The Islamic world is known to have consistently maintained the scientific knowledge of the Greeks and Romans , preserving the works of Aristotle and Ptolemy , among others .They were well aware the Earth was round , having calculated with relatively good precision its circumference in the early 9th century .As historian Jeffrey Burton Russell stated , .With extraordinary few exceptions , no educated person in the history of Western Civilization from the third century B.C. onward believed that the Earth was flat .The debate since then among the educated , both religious and secular , was not whether the Earth was approximately a sphere , but exactly what the size of the Earth was .The idea of sailing west to reach India also has its origins in antiquity , with the first known person to mention the notion being the Roman writer Strabo in the 1st century BC , who stated : .Beyond the educated , even the most empty headed sailor knew the Earth was round simply by the fact that ships and the like disappeared over the horizon with the bottom first and then the mast the last to be sighted .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"62.178093"}

' ' Friedman repeats one of the oldest myths in American history , a legend that rivals the tale of George Washington and the cherry tree .Columbus and his sailors did not believe that the Earth was flat , nor did the King and Queen of Spain .They all knew the world was a globe , from the shape of the Earth during lunar eclipses .Aristotle and Eratosthenes had discerned this 1,800 years earlier .The church taught that the Earth was a globe , but argued that the Sun revolved around it .The real question at issue was the size of the Earth , not its shape .Columbus thought the globe was small enough to reach China and the east by a relatively short voyage , while others correctly argued that the Earth was too large for such a voyage to be practical .They were right , but Columbus found America rather than Asia .Columbus did not prove the Earth was round , and no one feared sailing off the edge .The flat - Earth myth was exposed by J.B. Russell in his book , Inventing the Flat Earth .James W. Loewen , in his book , Lies Across America , traced the legend to a fable by Washington Irving in 1828 .I also wrote a letter on April 6th to the Public Editor appointed in the wake of the Jayson Blair scandal to act as ombudsman .Dear Public Editor : .The New York Times Magazine on April 3 published an article by Tom Friedman opening with the statement that Columbus reported that the world was round .This is a false statement of fact .Columbus and his men never believed the earth was flat and neither did the authorities at the time .I have pointed this out in letters to the editors of the Magazine and of the Editorial Page ( which posted the article on its website ) .I am writing separately to you because of the wider implications .Why is the Times propagating false historical information ?Why is it portraying myth as fact ?Why not require the writer to state correctly that \" legend has it that Columbus proved the earth was round \" ?This is just appalling .Everyone believes that \" Columbus proved the earth was round , \" but now they will believe it more because it is printed in the Times .The story started as a fable in the 19th Century , then was exposed as fiction in the 20th .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"62.369293"}

Most- correctly -thought Eratosthenes ' estimate was probably reasonably accurate , meaning that if one did not encounter a well stocked land mass in between Spain and Asian to resupply , Columbus ' expedition would end in failure with the crew dying of thirst or starvation .In fact , this would have happened if not for Columbus encountering the Caribbean islands around where he expected to encounter his destination .Queen Isabella eventually sided with Columbus and agreed to finance the expedition , despite the objections of scholars who were consulted over the plan .As to how the myth that people during Medieval times thought the Earth was flat came about , this is up for debate .The myth gained significant traction in the 19th century with various works , such as Andrew Dickson White 's History of the Warfare of Science with Theology .The \" Columbus / Flat Earth Myth \" itself was widely popularized in Washington Irving 's The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus , which was in numerous places largely fiction , though presented as fact and a scholarly work .In fact , there is no first hand record of any such objection to Columbus ' expedition , with the primary documented objections having to do with the length of the journey .One of the only significant Christian works that seems to put forth the notion of a flat Earth was written by an Egyptian Monk in the 6th century AD , Christian Topography .On the whole , though , evidence seems to indicate this work was n't very influential , as you might expect given that most educated Christians were well aware of the mountain of evidence that the world was a sphere .That being said , Christian Topography was often cited as support for the notion that Christians thought the world was flat until recently , with those authors casually ignoring all evidence to the contrary .Another common myth surrounding Columbus ' voyage was that he was the first to discover the \" New World \" .In fact , there is no question that North America was visited by Northern Europeans in the 10th or 11th centuries .Specifically , Norse settlements , one of which has since been excavated , were established in continental North America in the 10th century .The settlements were a failure in part , it appears , due to problems with the Native Americans , who the Norse called Skrælings .However , according to recent scholarship , the Norsemen continued to meet and trade with indigenous Americans , at least sporadically , even after the failure of the two colonies they setup .Not the dull oafs of legend and Capital One commercials , the Vikings apparently made a map of their North American conquests .The Vineland map is believed by some to have been made circa 1440 , and demonstrates that at least some Europeans were aware of the existence of continental North America , well before Columbus set sail .Today , there is also increasing evidence , and speculation , that the Americas were visited by Muslim and Chinese explorers long before the \" Age of Discovery \" in the late 15th and 16th centuries .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"66.07712"}

{"text":"When his thoughts and actions throughout his voyages are considered , one can see that Columbus was never respectful of the rights of the natives he encountered .His first sight of what he termed \" Indians \" was of a group of attractive , unclothed people .Speculation is that , to him , their nakedness represented a lack of culture , customs , and religion ( Wilford 159 ) .Columbus saw this as an opportunity to spread the word of God , while at the same considering how they could possibly be exploited .He believed that they would be easy to conquer because they appeared defenseless , easy to trick because they lacked experience in trade , and an easy source of profit because they could be enslaved ( Fernandez - Armesto 83 ) .It obviously did not occur to Columbus to consider these people in any terms aside from that of master and slave .These thoughts were merely a foreshadowing of what was to come .Even in Columbus 's own letters one can see the arrogance he possessed in claiming the islands he found .In a letter describing his findings to his friend Luis de Santangel , he wrote , \" And there I found very many islands filled with people innumerable , and of them all I have taken possession for their Highnesses .... \" ( 12 ) .Columbus never stopped to consider that these islands were not his to take , nor were the people that inhabited them .He simply took over these lands , even going so far as to rename them all .In order to let everyone know of his great discovery , he returned to Spain with many new items , including kidnapped Indians ( Fernandez - Armesto 89 ) .He was attempting to glorify Spain and its monarchs while creating fame for himself .Columbus 's arrogance and exploitation regarding slavery began on his second voyage .Ferdinand and Isabella had ordered that the natives be treated kindly .In opposition to this order , Columbus began exporting slaves in great numbers in 1494 .It was because he was not making any real profit elsewhere on the island that he decided to exploit the one source of income -- people -- he had in abundance ( Fernandez - Armesto 107 ) .When word reached him that the crown did not want him sending more slaves , Columbus ignored it .He was desperate to make his expeditions profitable enough for Ferdinand and Isabella 's continued support .Evidently he was not reprimanded because thousands of Indians were exported .By the time they reached Spain , usually a third of them were dead .Bartolome de las Casas wrote that one Spaniard had told him they did not need a compass to find their way back to Spain ; they could simply follow the bodies of floating Indians who had been tossed overboard when they died ( 17 ) .It is horrible to consider that the exportation of these natives resulted in thousands of deaths .It is much worse when one realizes that they were caused by one man 's desire for glory .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"73.503914"}

{"text":"One of Columbus 's first stops in Spain was the monastery of La Rábida in the southern port town of Palos de la Frontera , not far from the Portuguese border .At the monastery Columbus found not only a boarding place for his son Diego but also support from the friars , several of whom became great believers in his vision .One of them , Friar Antonio Marchena , spent many hours discussing geography with Columbus .He also helped shape Columbus 's plans by directing him to the writings of the ancients and of church authorities who were known to support the idea of a westward crossing of the ocean .Through Marchena , Columbus was introduced to powerful noblemen as well , including Friar Juan Pérez , one of the guardians of the monastery - and the confessor of Queen Isabella .Pérez introduced Columbus to the court of the Spanish monarchs .Columbus moved to Sevilla ( Seville ) in 1485 , and between May 1486 and September 1487 , he was maintained at the expense of the queen .Although interested in his ideas , the king and queen were in the midst of a protracted war to conquer the province of Granada in southern Spain , which had been held by the Moors , a Muslim group , since 711 .This war left the monarchs little time to consider Columbus 's plan .Finally , in 1487 , Columbus presented his project to a committee of experts called to hear the case .The committee raised numerous objections , asked many questions , and , in the end , rejected the plan .Among the reasons given for the rejection was that the ocean was simply too large to cross .While waiting for the war in Granada to end , Columbus established a liaison with a young peasant woman named Beatriz Enríquez de Arana .During this period of great despair , Columbus 's one comfort was his love for Beatriz .Although the two never married , in 1488 they had a son named Ferdinand , who later accompanied his father on his final voyage to the Americas .In the last weeks of 1491 Columbus made his final appeal to the Spanish monarchs in the royal camp as the monarchs prepared for their final battle with the Moors in Granada .But again his plan was rejected .Columbus had successfully won over many of the learned scholars and scientific advisers , but this time the rejection was due primarily to his excessive demands for rewards .According to tradition , as Columbus rode away on his mule , Ferdinand 's treasurer , Luis de Santángel , interceded on Columbus 's behalf .Arguing that the investment was small considering the potential reward , Santángel convinced the king and queen to reverse their decision .A court official was dispatched on horseback to bring Columbus back .After several more weeks of negotiating a contract , in April 1492 Columbus left for Palos de la Frontera and his rendezvous with history .The people of Palos were ordered to provide and equip two caravels ( small , light sailing ships ) .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"77.07879"}

Roosevelt signed the day into law as a federal holiday in 1937 , the rest has been history .In an attempt to further thwart the celebration of this \" holiday , \" we at ICTMN have outlined eight misnomers and bloody , greedy , sexually perverse and horrendous atrocities committed by Columbus and his men .After obtaining funding for his explorations to reach Asia from the seizure and sale of properties from Spanish Jews and Muslims by order of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella , Columbus headed out to explore a new world with money and ships .Brimming with the excitement of discovering new land , Columbus offered a reward of 10,000 maravedis or about $ 540 ( a sailor 's yearly salary ) for the first person to discover such land .Though another sailor saw the land in October 1492 , Columbus retracted the reward he had previously offered because he claimed he had seen a dim light in the west .We 're not talking about the Leif Ericson Viking explorer story .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"81.38025"}

{"text":"[34 ] Las Casas ' Confesionario was designed to enforce all the New Laws .The confessor was to deny absolution to anyone who profited from Indian life and land .Moreover , since these rules asserted the illegality of the encomienda system and the conquest - a defiance of royal authority , because it was the king who had granted them -- he was questioning royal authority .This amounted to his questioning the divine rights of kings .He would surely have been charged with treason , punishable by death if the rules had leaked out .This is true because it seems that Las Casas wrote his Confesionario partially in response to the Emperor 's revocation of important parts of the New Laws on November 20 , 1545 .Charles V gave into the arguments and petitions of the representatives of the colonists at court .In anticipation of this accusation Las Casas wrote a letter to the Regent , Crown Prince Philip , who was in charge of the Spanish dominions in the Emperor 's absence , arguing for ecclesiastical exemption from the coercive power of secular princes .[ 35 ] Even with his preemptive defensive letter to Philip , his manual became known and raised a political as well as an ecclesiastical storm .After attending the meeting of bishops and church leaders in Mexico City , he returned to Spain in 1547 .He would never see the New World again and later resigned his bishopric .By this time in his life , it seems that he understood that his true place was at court , and that there he alone could serve as the much - needed \" universal procurator \" of his beloved Indians .[36 ] The beleaguered Bishop probably did not foresee that he would first have to serve as procurator in his own cause .[ 37 ] .Back in Spain in 1547 , Las Casas encountered accusations concerning his now public Confesionario .His defense against charges of high treason from his detractors , for his confessors manual , reached its climax when he debated the humanist Juan Ginés Sepúlveda .In his counterattack Las Casas challenged Sepúlveda 's Democrates Secundus , a tract that justified waging war in the process of the conquest in order to \" christianize \" the peoples of the Americas .Las Casas debated Sepúlveda at the Junta de Valladolid of 1550 - 1551 where the judges of the exchange were a panel of fourteen distinguished religious and laity , of whom four were fellow Dominicans .Sepúlveda appeared the first day and gave a three - hour summary of the doctrine of his Democrates Secundus to the Junta .For the next five days , Las Casas offered his rebuttal , Argumentum Apologiae , countering that , even if some of the Indians were guilty of human sacrifice and cannibalism , it could be explained as a rational step in the development of religious thought .[ 38 ]Although no verdict was handed down , the royal cédulas of the Council of the Indies continued to apply the thesis of Las Casas .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"85.33444"}

{"text":"I recall a short science article by Isaac Asimov as far back as the early 1960s that debunked this fable , but it lives on .It seems to me that a legend born in the 19th Century and demolished in the 20th now has new life in the 21st .Book Review : Inventing the Flat Earth by Jeffrey Burton Russell .I have known about the flat earth error for some time but I have never actually read a book or even a scholarly article detailing where the myth started and how it entered our popular culture .Then I came across Inventing the Flat Earth by Dr. Russell , and I was impressed with how quickly he presented the argument and dealt with the issue .It covers the topic very well and gives you a good sense of how , and why , the flat earth error started .But because of its length , it is only good as a starting point if you want to get deeper into the subject .For those who only want to learn about the flat earth error and how it started then this is the book for you .First , the book is about the flat earth error also referred to as the Myth of the Flat Earth , not to be confused with the error of the flat earth .Simply put , the flat earth error is the idea that people in the middle ages thought that the earth was flat and not spherical .As Dr. Russell demonstrates , ever since the Greeks proved the sphericity of the earth the scholarly consensus has been that the earth was spherical .There was some debate as to the size , whether or not there was land on the opposite side and whether or not that land was inhabited .But there was never any serious question as to whether or not the earth was a sphere .Dr. Russell explains that the only opposition to Columbus was not from people who thought the earth was flat , but from other scholars who thought that the earth was bigger than Columbus calculated it to be ( which it was ) .If Columbus 's calculations were correct then it would have been possible to sail west from Europe to Asia using the boats they were building at the time .If he was wrong , then the distance would have been too great and they would not have been able to make the journey ( alive ) .That was the only concern raised by scholars at the time .Other than that those writings were not cited , noted , quoted , or even read until the 1800 's when historians and scholars began citing them as evidence that \" everyone \" believed the earth was flat .Dr. Russell goes into more detail in his book .Thus scholars cherry picked the writings of a few theologians from the middle ages and said , \" Look !People used to think that the earth was flat , and they thought this until Columbus proved that it was round . \"","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"104.289154"}

{"text":"Oxytocin makes some muscles contract , but it results in lactation if there 's milk ( prolactine is needed for it first ) and in birth if uterine muscles are big enough ( it takes some nine months of pregnancy first ) .Jan : Do you have a citation for CS correlating more with baby blues ?I do n't know if that 's oxytocin , or the fact that CS has a longer recovery time associated due to the abdominal surgery .Would like to see that study .The lactivists say that baby blues is likely to be aided by breastfeeding , and I think C - sections are more associated with never breastfeeding .That said , I think the CS and postnatal depression link is not well - established , although there are a number of studies looking at it .Have there been any studies about what , precisely , \" bonding \" means ?Viewing it as some purely biological response linked to feeding alone seems a bit perilous to me .Humans are not animals .Generally , they choose to carry a child for nine months and their feelings about infants are a whole lot more complex than merely reproduction .The few studies I have seen on bonding are laughably vague .Maybe oxytocin does provoke some kind of extra conditioned response , but I find it extremely difficult to believe that its absence has that much effect on mother / child bonding in the sense I mean it - unconditional love and life - long commitment .And as for CS / baby blues , the anxiety following what may have been a perilous birth is , again , not the same as a purely hormonal response .I would concede that the scientific study of hormones is interesting and instructive , but it too easily can be used to feed more ideological than scientific thinking .I would believe that there is a correlation with C - sections and postpartum depression because I think what causes both is insufficient nitric oxide .Not all C - sections are due to effects of low NO , but enough that there should be a correlation .I think that essentially all postpartum depression is caused by low NO .NO is important for angiogenesis and the proper vascularization of the placenta .Gestational diabetes causes the fetus to grow larger than it should ( perhaps causing cephalopelvic disproportion ) .All of these correlate with obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome .Postpartum depression is ( I think ) caused by insufficient liver metabolic capacity to support gluconeogenesis for lactation .That is caused by insufficient NO to trigger enough mitochondria biogenesis .Without enough mitochondria , the mitochondria potential gets pushed high , where more superoxide is made to acutely increase metabolic capacity .When that gets chronic , then the NO level never gets high enough to support the level of mitochondria biogenesis that is needed .You have to reduce metabolic load enough to reduce mitochondria potential so that NO levels can go up and mitochondria biogenesis can resume .If you do n't , then postpartum depression proceeds to postpartum psychosis .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"110.610916"}

{"text":"For it 's true , oxytocin DOES influence behavior .Oxytocin DOES promote things like affiliative behavior with one 's young .Examples : rats , once they give birth , will pick up pups and carry them around .They 'll build a nest for them ( if they have n't already ) , and lick them and basically associate with them like good rat mommies .However , if you give a rat mom something to block oxytocin , she will not pick up the pups , carry them around , or make a nest .Giving oxytocin to sheep will induce maternal behavior by sheep for lambs that are not their own , even if the sheep has never given birth .And this pattern appears to hold true in humans as well .Mothers who have secure attachments to their newborns have stronger activation of the pituitary ( where oxytocin is released ) when they see pictures of their child , than mothers with less secure attachments .Some studies also indicate that women with particular oxytocin gene regulation may show more signs of \" sensitive \" parenting .It appears that oxytocin release is a significant part of how women react to their babies , and how much they affiliate with them in the first months of life .And this is where people get squirmy .Because does n't this mean that women are the TOOLS of their HORMONES ? !And if women are the tools of their hormones , does n't this mean they that BIOLOGY has DECREED that they stay indoors , barefoot and pregnant ?And of course there 's the even more squirmy question : if some women are better at raising children than others due to their genes , should women be screened for these genes before having children ?In my opinion , heck no .Women ( and men ) are certainly influenced by their hormones , and certainly influenced by their genes .But hormones and genes do not act in a vacuum .They act within an environment , and very importantly , within a society .A woman is very capable of both affiliating and responding sensitively to her baby and to still maintain a life .And we are certainly not forced by our hormones to play certain roles .It 's important to remember that societal interactions are as important , and sometimes MORE important , than hormones and genes .Oxytocin never prevented the societal norms of sending rich women 's children to wet nurses and governesses back in the day .Oxytocin genes might help more sensitive parenting from the start , but someone who lacks them is not necessarily an insensitive parent .We are all capable of learning from our surroundings and learning what works best for our children , and it is obvious that fluctuations in oxytocin levels are not the be all end all of parenting .If they WERE , then all parents would have uniformly high oxytocin levels , evolution having weeded out over time the primate females who had low oxytocin levels , and thus did not care for their young effectively and raise successful offspring .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"119.52442"}

{"text":"The muscle stretching of the cervix triggers receptors which send nerve impulses to the brain .4 ) Brain releases oxytocin .5 ) Oxytocin further softens and dilates the cervix .6 ) Baby weight pushes downward on the softened cervix and stretches it . 7 )Lather , rinse , repeat .8) BABY ! ! !\"Positive feedback \" is the stretching of the cervix which promotes oxytocin , which promotes stretching , which promotes MORE oxytocin .The actions of the hormone trigger the release of more hormone .If you 're like Sci , you will think this is really , really cool .However , oxytocin is not necessarily NEEDED for birth .There are oxytocin knockout mice that do not have oxytocin and can still reproduce ( but these are knockout animals , and so growing up without oxytocin , their bodies could compensate ) .But it 's very clear that oxytocin is very important in the normal birth process .So , pretty important .Lactation Another one of oxytocin 's big roles in women ( and in female mammals in general ) is in lactation , where it serves a very important role in milk letdown .While other hormones ( like prolactin ) are involved in actually MAKING milk , oxytocin is very important for releasing it , in what 's known as the let - down reflex .Goes like this ( again , the simplified version , the complicated version involves dopamine and a host of other hormones ) : 1 ) Baby sucks at nipple 2 )The sensation of suckling heads to the brain ( skipping some detailed steps here ) .3 )The hypothalamus is stimulated and oxytocin is released from the posterior pituitary .4 ) Oxytocin in this case acts to contract the muscles around the alveoli in the breast .5 )The squeezed alveoli deliver milk to the milk sinus via the duct .6 ) Baby sucks , milk comes out .And now we get to the third , best part of oxytocin in women : Orgasm .( um ... pic here ... um ... nah ... )Oxytocin is actually important in sexual arousal for both men and women ( I 'll cover more about the men in the next post ) .During sexual arousal , oxytocin increases rapidly , with a big burst at orgasm .In fact , in women , the strength of orgasm is directly correlated with the amount of oxytocin .Oxytocin levels correlate to sexual arousal in women , as well as the amount of vaginal lubrication present .The luteal phase is the phase after ovulation , as the egg sits around and grows old until the shedding of the uterine lining during menstruation at the end of the month .Sci will probably have to blog about this sometime ) .So oxytocin is very important physically , helping us enjoy the procreation of the species and allowing the species to get out of the womb and get fed .Now , we move on to the first of many fuzzier roles for oxytocin : Maternal bonding ( awwwww )","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"127.29684"}
