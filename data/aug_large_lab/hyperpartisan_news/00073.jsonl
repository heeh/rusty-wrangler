{"text":"_ _ _ .AP White House correspondent Julie Pace in Chicago contributed to this report .WASHINGTON ( AP ) - Hillary Rodham Clinton jumped back into presidential politics on Sunday , making a much - awaited announcement she will again seek the White House with a promise to serve as the \" champion \" of everyday Americans .And unlike eight years ago , when she ran as a candidate with a deep resume in Washington , Clinton and her personal history were n't the focus of the first message of her campaign .In the online video that kicked off her campaign , she made no mention of her time in the Senate and four years as secretary of state , or the prospect she could make history as the nation 's first female president .Instead , the video is collection of voters talking about their lives , their plans and aspirations for the future .Clinton does n't appear until the very end .\" I 'm getting ready to do something , too .I 'm running for president , \" Clinton said .\" Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times , but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top .Every day Americans need a champion , and I want to be that champion , so you can do more than just get by .You can get ahead and stay ahead .It 's a message that also made an immediate play to win over the support of liberals in her party for whom economic inequality has become a defining issue .They remain skeptical of Clinton 's close ties to Wall Street and the centrist economic policies of the administration of her husband , former President Bill Clinton .Many had hoped Clinton would face a challenge from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who has said she will not run .Unlike some of the Republicans who have entered the race , Clinton was scant on policy specifics on her first day as a candidate .Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul , for example , kicked off his campaign with a website and online videos that described his positions on an array of domestic and foreign policy issues .Clinton also began her campaign for president in 2007 with a video , followed by a splashy rally in Des Moines where she said , \" I 'm running for president , and I 'm in it to win it .\" This time around , Clinton will instead head this week to the first - to - vote Iowa , looking to connect with voters directly at a community college and small business roundtable in two small towns .When families are strong , America is strong .So I 'm hitting the road to earn your vote .Because it 's your time .And I hope you 'll join me on this journey , \" she said in the video .This voter - centric approach was picked with a purpose , her advisers said , to show that Clinton is not taking the nomination for granted .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"28.414433"}

Roosevelt in the early 1930s era of the Great Depression .He reminded many of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler , both of whom had not yet become as aggressive and warlike as they would become in the mid to late 1930s and early 1940s .This despicable man was a true Fascist demagogue with too many people ready to back him , but his cockiness and arrogance and false charges finally brought him down .A true Fascist demagogue of the worst kind , he actually gained five states and 46 electoral votes as a third party candidate for President in 1968 .Then , while running in 1972 again , he was shot and paralyzed for life by an assassin , a tragic event for sure , but brought on by his notoriety and demagogic nature .Wallace 's story is well covered in Chapter 11 of my new book mentioned above .And now we have , at the least , two Fascist demagogues , now considered the front runners in the Republican race for President - Donald Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz !Again , the fight against right wing Fascism and its elements - racism , nativism , misogyny , antisemitism - remain a battle decent people must fight with every ounce of their energy !Now that there are only three Democratic Presidential candidates - Hillary Clinton , Bernie Sanders , and Martin O'Malley - the question rises whether O'Malley has any shot at the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2016 .All were underdogs and not in front in public opinion polls in the fall of the year before each national election .So looking at Democratic Party history , O'Malley MIGHT have a shot at defeating two opponents a full generation older than him-16 years younger than Clinton , and 22 years younger than Sanders .But no one seems to think that this can happen , as Clinton in particular , and Sanders to some extent , have taken all of the oxygen out of the room .Only four Presidents have been able to run from the Vice Presidency for President and triumph , with all but one in the first 50 years of the Republic , as follows : .John Adams 1796 .Thomas Jefferson 1800 .Martin Van Buren 1836 .The other President is George H.

Roosevelt decided to seek a third term .In 1948 , former Vice President Henry Wallace in the third term of FDR tried for the Presidency as a third party candidate ( Progressive Party ) , fighting against fourth FDR term Vice President Harry Truman , who had succeeded FDR upon his death in 1945 .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"68.14224"}

{"text":"As the son of Cuban immigrants , Rubio has a fascinating narrative and is well positioned to take full advantage of his heritage , youth , and position as senator for the key state of Florida heading into 2016 .Accordingly , this visit was all about establishing international credibility and elevating the senator in the eyes of potential kingmakers in the GOP .Senior parliamentarians with whom he met were understood to have been impressed , although those who had not met with him were heard to mutter in the corridors of power ' Is n't he a bit of a nutter ? 'Well , the simple answer is , no , he is n't , and it is concerning that such a view was being aired so openly .Whilst the depth of the senator 's grasp of the issues was never tested , his breadth of knowledge and the span of the talk were more than sufficient .Cuba was mentioned just once , clearly signalling that Rubio is seeking to position himself not as the Cuban candidate , but simply as a candidate who happens to be of Cuban extraction .He will , doubtless , reap an electoral windfall from the huge influx of Latino voters who are expected to form a huge voting bloc in 2016 .One wonders in what capacity London will next welcome Marco Rubio to these shores ?In November 2012 , Barack Obama won re - election to a second term as President of the United States .Since then , many have been eagerly awaiting confirmation as to who he would name to the key foreign policy positions in his administration : State , Defence , NSC , CIA etc .What has emerged can safely be described as having NOT been Obama 's first choice line - up and has taken far longer than expected to emerge .These two aspects are NOT unrelated as the timing of the announcements and the individuals named have been impacted by a series of unforeseen incidents that could have long - term implications , and stretch well into Obama 's second term .In planning for his anticipated second - term , it is safe to conclude that Barack Obama anticipated naming Dr. Susan Rice as Hillary Clinton 's replacement as Secretary of State and to continue with David Petraeus as DCI .The fact that neither individual will be in their anticipated position come Inauguration Day owes much to the debacle in Benghazi , a calamity that will continue to dog Obama into 2013 .It will certainly be an issue for Hillary Clinton if she considers a run for the presidency in 2016 .Her role as Secretary of State at the time of the incident and subsequent incapacity , which has prevented her from testifying in the subject , will doubtless be open to scrutiny in 4 years time .Ironically , it appears certain that part of the reason for allocating this task to Ambassador Rice was an attempt to elevate her visibility and stature ahead of the nomination process in an anticipated second - term .If this was the case then it spectacularly backfired , casing senators to openly question her suitability for the role , and allowing other questions to be raised in relation to her political and personal qualities .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"90.65421"}
