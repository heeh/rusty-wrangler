{"text":"Delmer Smith is only one of several serial killers and rapists who have literally gotten away with murder thanks to lax sentencing , nonexistent parole , and failure to enforce DNA database laws - a systematic neglect of legal reforms that cost countless women their lives .There 's John Floyd Thomas , suspected of killing some 30 women in Los Angeles - his first rape conviction was in 1957 .There 's Walter E. Ellis , who killed at least nine women , and managed to avoid detection because Wisconsin officials failed to bother to hold him responsible for submitting another inmate 's DNA as his own before releasing him from prison .I had just spent several months and many hundreds of dollars to get copies of the police investigation reports for my rape and some of the court records of the man who was accused of , but never prosecuted for the crime .Every time he was sent away on another sex crime conviction , the police closed all the other rape cases they attributed to him .In 1987 he was tried for one sexual assault , and at least six other cases were shelved , including mine .Such was the economy of justice in 1987 : rapes were not deemed important enough to expend the court resources to try every known defendant for every crime .This attitude arose not from the police but from the legal establishment and , by extension , the public .It was an accepted status quo , not just in Sarasota , but everywhere .To behave as if each rape victim actually deserved justice and every woman deserved to be safe from offenders was not anybody 's priority for spending money in 1987 .The same can still be said today , though attitudes have spottily improved .We 've never spent enough money to thoroughly investigate and prosecute more than a fraction of all crimes .Criminals know this , though the public remains largely oblivious .I remember being astonished when the police told me the D.A. would not be prosecuting my case , even though there was evidence and a rape kit .A few months later , the first rape case in the United States using DNA evidence would be won in Orlando , a mere hundred miles and three jurisdictions away .There , the D.A. had decided to be aggressive and use this new technology already in use in Britain , and he succeeded .But more than a decade would pass before DNA evidence was even routinely collected and databased in most states .A lot of people slipped through the cracks unnecessarily during that decade , including my rapist .Sentenced to 15 years for his 1997 crime , he walked out of prison seven years later , the beneficiary of both the state 's unwillingness to fully fund prisons and activists ' efforts to get every convict back onto the streets as quickly as possible .He immediately returned to raping elderly women , his preferred victims , and was n't back in prison until 1998 .At least the prisoner activists , and the defense bar , were happy .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"63.8825"}

{"text":"He leaves his mother 's house only to report to his job as an office technician with the Office of the Virginia Attorney General , Ken Cuccinnelli .Without a writ of innocence or a pardon , Haynesworth can not be cleared .Accepting DNA 's Limitations .In 1992 , the newly founded Innocence Project began taking cases from prisoners with claims of innocence whose cases were suitable for post - conviction DNA testing .By 2000 , 67 people had been exonerated , and the organization was swamped with letters from prisoners seeking assistance .This trend has not slowed in 19 years .Today the organization receives over 3,000 letters a year and nearly 300 people have been exonerated .Yet the total number of wrongful convictions surely surpasses this .Many wrongfully convicted prisoners have no DNA evidence to test .Over 20 % of the cases closed by the Innocence Project since 2004 were closed because evidence had been lost or destroyed .Despite diligent searching , there just is n't a Mary Jane Burton in every state .Evidence preservation laws have become more commonplace , but many jurisdictions , even major metropolitan areas , still have hopelessly outdated paper - based systems .If DNA evidence had existed in all three of Haynesworth 's convictions , it could easily have proven his innocence of those crimes .In a sexual assault case in which a single perpetrator attacks a stranger , and consent is not an issue , the results are easily interpreted .When a real perpetrator , like Leon Davis , can be identified through a DNA database hit , it not only exonerates the innocent but also solves the crime .As it stands , investigators and attorneys had to look carefully at the pattern of crimes in Haynesworth 's cases to see if they were likely committed by the same perpetrator .Such cases have resulted in exoneration before .But what about those cases that are not suitable for DNA testing at all ?Very few cases involve physical evidence that could be subjected to DNA testing , even among violent crimes .Unlike any other type of evidence , DNA testing can conclusively prove innocence ( or guilt ) to an unprecedented degree of scientific certainty .But a system that depends on DNA testing alone to protect the innocent is a failed system .DNA illuminates the flaws in the criminal justice system ; it does not eliminate them .Those flaws include eyewitness misidentification ; improper use of the forensic sciences or reliance on outdated or invalidated forensic methods ; false confessions , admissions , and even guilty pleas ; jailhouse informant testimony , and more .Simple , cost - effective reforms - improving police lineup procedures , for example , or mandating that all interrogations be recorded - can reduce the rate of wrongful convictions , and by extension , assist in the apprehension of real perpetrators .Some states have been slow to adopt these reforms .Before DNA exonerations became common , criminal justice professionals struggled to understand the implications of the technology .DNA testing trumps all other types of evidence- whether it 's a witness who swears that he could never forget a face , a co - defendants ' confession , or a hair analyst who claims to have a match .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"72.17485"}
{"text":"Emotional issues often play a role in false accusations , whether it is intentional or not .The fear of someone finding out about the sexual relationship or the guilt associated with having a sexual relationship with someone , can result in a person being falsely accused .Mistaken identity is also common in these types of cases .False Accusation : Unfortunately , there are situations where a person is falsely accused of rape .An example might be that , after having consensual sex , one of the parties has feelings of guilt because they were involved in a committed relationship .But , rather than admitting to the infidelity , accuses the other party of rape .Also , a false accusation could result after being pressured and coerced by another to say they were raped .The Accused Believed There Was Consent : If the accused did not have a clear understanding that the accuser did not want to have sexual intercourse , this may be a defense .Although , any indication from a party , at any time , that they want to stop , would constitute no consent .There was no actual intercourse .Lack of Sufficient Evidence : If there is no physical evidence and no witnesses , then it becomes one person 's word against the other and therefore , too difficult to prosecute .Mistaken Identity : Because rape victims are traumatized and emotional , it is not uncommon to unintentionally identify the wrong person .If there was poor lighting during the attack , identification is more difficult .If the attacker is wearing a mask , identification becomes extremely difficult .Also , police lineups are often prejudicial and result in mistaken identity .What Does A Prosecutor Have To Prove For A Rape Conviction .To be convicted of rape , it must be proven that : 1 )The parties engaged in sexual intercourse ; 2 )That the sexual intercourse was accomplished by physical force , violence duress , menace , fear of bodily harm , fear of retaliation or fraud .There must also be a lack of consent .What Is Lack Of Consent - The obvious is that the victim did not give consent .The consequences of a rape conviction can be severe and can permanently damage a person 's life .Because of the issues dealing with the emotional and physical evidence of such a crime , often innocent people are accused of this very serious crime .For this reason , it is strongly advised that anyone who has been accused of rape , whether or not an arrest has occurred , should consult with an experienced criminal defense attorney .Often , an attorney who has a good working relationship with the District Attorney 's Office , can speak with the District Attorney reviewing the case for filing , and present information that may result in the case being rejected .A Santa Ana City Councilman , who was also once an Orange County , executive , has been charged with sexual battery , along with several other felony counts dealing with sexual misconduct .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"72.58435"}

Warner launched a massive DNA review of convictions .Burton died in 1999 and never learned of the tremendous impact of her work ; so far six wrongfully convicted Virginians were proven innocent because of her practice of preserving evidence .The review also led to DNA tests in Haynesworth 's case .The DNA testing cleared Haynesworth in one of the rape convictions .Moreover , the Department of Forensic Science matched the sperm sample to the genetic profile of a convicted rapist named Leon Davis .DNA testing on a second rape that Haynesworth was charged with , but not convicted of , also cleared Haynesworth and pointed to Davis .Biological evidence from Haynesworth 's other two convictions , however , does not exist .In one of the convictions , documents show that evidence was destroyed .There never was any biological evidence available in the other conviction .Profile of a Perpetrator .Davis was suspected of committing at least a dozen rapes in Richmond and Henrico County in 1984 , and he is currently serving multiple life sentences for those crimes .Davis and Haynesworth lived in the same neighborhood ; they resembled each other and were sometimes mistaken for each other .All of the crimes were perpetrated within the same one - mile radius and all shared the same modus operandi .If DNA testing proved that Davis committed two of the crimes , it follows logically that he committed them all .Haynesworth now waits for a hearing with the Virginia Court of Appeals .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"75.286"}

{"text":"Most states criminalize sexual conduct that does not include penetration , oral sex or sodomy , but that is conduct that is sexual in nature and occurs without the other person 's consent .This conduct usually is referred to as sexual battery or criminal sexual contact .( Note : Some states define sexual battery as sexual penetration while others define it as only sexual touching . )Consent .Lack of consent is the crucial component of sex crimes .Sexual conduct becomes criminal when sexual touch is not consented to , either because the offender forces another person to be sexual against his or her will , or because the other person is considered incapable of consenting or has a diminished capacity to consent .States generally criminalize sex with a minor under the age of fourteen or fifteen , a developmentally disabled person , someone who is mentally ill , or a person who is incapacitated - drugged , drunk or unconscious - or otherwise physically helpless .When sexual contact is with a developmentally disabled or mentally ill person , the issue of consent may be whether the person had the capacity to knowingly consent to sexual contact .Sexual conduct with a minor .In some states , sex with a minor is criminalized only if the offender is older than the victim by a certain number of years - more than three years , for instance .This allows for a fifteen year old to have sex with her eighteen year old boyfriend without the boyfriend 's actions being criminal .If a 21 year old had sex with a 15 year old in the same state , however , the sex would be criminal .Sexual conduct by person in authority or mental health care provider .Many states also criminalize sex between a person in authority - such as a teacher , police officer or prison guard - and someone over whom that person has authority - a student , a person in police custody , or a prisoner in a correctional facility or jail .The rationale for criminalizing this conduct is that capacity to consent is diminished by the authority the teacher or other authority figure has over the student or other person .Many states also criminalize sex between a psychotherapist or other mental health care provider and a client or patient on the grounds that the nature of the relationship makes the client or patient incapable of knowing , voluntary consent .Defenses .Defendants charged with sexual assault have the usual defenses available to all criminal defendants , starting with \" Someone else committed this offense . \"A defendant also can claim that the sexual activity was consensual .In a sexual assault case , there can be significant questions about what constitutes consent or what constitutes refusal .This has led to the infamous question of when does \" No \" mean \" No .\" Is it as soon as the word is spoken , or must the victim object more vigorously ?Another possible defense is an insanity defense , in which the defense argues that the accused is mentally ill and did not have the capacity to control his behavior , to form criminal intent , or to understand what he was doing or that his actions were unlawful .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"91.33044"}
