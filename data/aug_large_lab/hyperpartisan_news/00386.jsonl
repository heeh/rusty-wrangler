{"text":"And as Hillary Rodham Clinton privately ponders another race for the presidency in 2016 , this year 's annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative seemed to also sum up all the promise of another Clinton campaign , as well as some of the peril .The former New York senator , looking well - rested and happy eight months after resigning as secretary of state , spoke with passion and humor about one good cause after another that she 'll pursue at the newly renamed Bill , Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation .What 's more , she spoke to the kind of people who could easily help her raise the hundreds of millions of dollars necessary for a modern presidential campaign : business leaders , Hollywood types and other assorted millionaires .Yet she did so in the very same week that the New Republic magazine published an article alleging that Doug Band , the man who long managed the Clinton Global Initiative , traded on his influence with Bill Clinton to win big - money consulting contracts .That story followed a New York Times piece that also criticized the foundation 's management practices during Band 's time there .Clinton backers dismiss those stories as mere noise that wo n't distract from the fact that the foundation , which does much good around the world , will offer Hillary Clinton a strong base from which to do the same in the coming years .Not surprisingly , though , Republicans look at the Clinton Foundation and see trouble - which they are determined to exploit as 2016 approaches .Taking to the stage at a Clinton Global Initiative event in Chicago in June , Hillary Clinton proclaimed that the foundation her husband founded after leaving the White House was now a joint venture .\" We are so excited and thrilled to have this be a full partnership between the three of us , \" including their daughter , Chelsea , she said .From there , Hillary Clinton announced that she would focus her work at the foundation on three issues : early childhood development , opportunities for women and girls , and economic development .Last week in New York City , she broadened her agenda , announcing that she would lead an effort to measure the progress of women 's rights worldwide and also work on a partnership aimed at protecting African elephants from poaching .Incongruous as those last two projects may seem , they 're the sort of do - good , feel - good efforts that could offer Clinton a useful public platform while she considers a presidential run .\" I think this is the perfect place for her at this point , \" said Maria Cardona , a Washington - based political consultant who advised the 2008 Clinton presidential campaign , in which the former first lady lost the race for the Democratic nomination to then - Sen .Barack Obama of Illinois .\" It 's a place where she can do some very positive public advocacy .\" The foundation gives Hillary Clinton an unencumbered opportunity to work on issues she 's passionate about , said Ellen Tauscher , a former California congresswoman and undersecretary of state during Clinton 's tenure there .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"46.93896"}

Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , compiled in a three - page letter to Abedin and Secretary of State John Kerry , adds drama to Weiner 's bid .Abedin has been essential to his attempt to move past his sexting scandal .The couple hauled in as much as $ 350,000 in outside income on top of Abedin 's $ 135,000 government salary after Weiner quit Congress amid a sexting scandal when he got caught sending out Tweets of his crotch .Abedin , who served as Clinton 's deputy chief of staff when Clinton was secretary of state , later became a \" special government employee \" who was able to haul in cash as a private contractor .The change in status came to light only last month .Abedin took on the new assignment after she gave birth to son Jordan and began working from New York .One of the clients she did consulting work for while on the government payroll was Teneo Holdings , a firm founded by longtime Bill Clinton aide Doug Band .Grassley , the top Judiciary Committee Republican , wrote that he was concerned Abedin 's status \" blurs the line between public- and private - sector employees , especially when employees receive full - time salaries for what appears to be part - time work . \"He peppered Abedin and Kerry with 13 questions about her employment .Among them : \" Who authorized the change in status in your official title ? \" and \" Who was made aware of the change in status ? \"A State Department official , noted there were 100 such consultants at the agency , saying , \" Miss Abedin 's status was approved through the normal process . \"","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"55.981796"}

Security Council Resolution 1973 for military intervention in Libya .On that day Clinton ordered a general within the Pentagon to refuse to take a call from Gadhafi 's son Seif and other high - level members within the regime , to help negotiate a resolution .A day later , on March 18 , 2011 , Gadhafi himself called for a cease - fire , another action the administration dismissed .In released , but redacted emails , Clinton expressed interest in arming Libyan opposition groups using private security contractors , though at the time , the opposition was not formally recognized by the U.S. or United Nations , which prohibited arming without following strict guidelines and oversight .In an April 8 , 2011 email to her then - deputy chief of staff , Jake Sullivan , Clinton wrote : \" FYI .The idea of using private security experts to arm the opposition should be considered , \" attaching an intelligence report from adviser Sidney Blumenthal , her preferred source of intelligence .Many of those weapons would ultimately be destined for Syria .The cargo reportedly included surface - to - air anti - aircraft missiles , RPG 's and Russian - designed shoulder - launched missiles known as MANPADS , all believed destined for Syrian rebel groups .Both Obama and Clinton had a vested interest in lying about Benghazi and permanently concealing the truth ; Obama to ensure his reelection prospects in 2012 and Hillary to protect hers for 2016 .It is significant , however , that Clinton was the most aggressive administration official promoting the arming of the Libyan Islamists and the first to associate the video with the Benghazi attack ( see timeline ) as well as its most vigorous and persistent advocate . \"The present Shia - Sunni civil war in Iraq was fueled by American abdication of a foreign policy in Syria , where we sub - contracted our interests to Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Turkey .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"79.77075"}

{"text":"He said that France has benefited less from the deal than it expected : .\" I think at the time the French felt there would be an upside for them , in that if it was clear that people could not easily get to Britain it would stop Sangatte building up again .The camp was closed .But history has shown that not to be the case .The French authorities still have a huge amount of pressure on their side .\"That said , the French government receives money from the British to help police Calais and its camps , and various French officials have acknowledged that their ports would receive even more traffic if refugees and migrants believed that it was easier to travel to the UK than before .If the treaty ended , would \" the Jungle \" just move to Dover ?There 's little doubt that because of linguistic and familial ties , and perhaps the perception that the UK is more welcoming than France , many refugees and migrants would come to the UK as quickly as they could to claim asylum here .Whiteman also said on Today that since the 2003 agreement , the annual number of asylum claims in the UK had declined from 80,000 to around 30,000 .So the UK could expect a significant spike in claims if the treaty were to end .But the British asylum process makes it unlikely that anything like \" the Jungle \" would spring up .Instead , those claiming asylum would be dispersed around the country or , if authorities are worried they would flee , held in an immigration detention centre .Why is Cameron saying this now ?This looks suspiciously like one of the Tories ' election strategist Lynton Crosby 's dead cats .That is , in an effort to distract his critics from the detail of the renegotiation , the PM has provoked a row about migrants and refugees .Cameron is clearly keen to move the debate on from the minutiae of different European agreements to bigger questions about security and terrorism .Though getting bogged down in competing interpretations of a treaty from 2003 may not be the best way to move onto that broader terrain .TRIAL OFFER .12 issues for £ 12 + FREE book .Good journalism is expensive .We notice you have ad blocking software enabled .Support the New Statesman 's quality , independent journalism by contributing now - and this message will disappear for the next 30 days .If we can not support the site on advertising revenue , we will have to introduce a pay wall - meaning fewer readers will have access to our incisive analysis , comprehensive culture coverage and groundbreaking long reads .Bill Clinton denies report on Foundation moves .The Post report also said Hillary Clinton took issue with Clinton 's involvement with Teneo , the company co - founded by longtime Bill Clinton aide Doug Band for which the former president served as a paid adviser .Teneo had been representing , among others , MF Global , the firm headed by Jon Corzine that collapsed financially .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"131.31961"}
