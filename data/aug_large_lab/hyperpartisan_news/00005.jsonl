McCain for his honorable service to our country .I have immense respect for him and what he 's endured in our name , but do feel very strongly that Obama 's proven track record in working with members of both parties are what this country needs to start coming back together .You need look no further than this blog to see how deeply divided we still remain ... and a house divided against itself can not stand .I feel Obama offers us the best chance of beginning to bridge those divisions .Will it be easy ?Of course not , but he alone is willing to make that effort .It is right down stupid to expect that Super Delegates should vote based on what others have voted .That boils down to SUPER DELEGATES NOT HAVING A VOTE ...... and if that is the case .... why even have Super Delegate votes if they are just going to copy the majority vote ? ?To tell anyone that they have to vote based on what the majority have voted is not only UNFAIR BUT RIDICULOUS !It is the same as telling a Juror that it does not mater what he thinks , he must go along with what the rest of the Jury believes .Obama supporters see the move as gracious , charismatic , optimisitc and slightly tongue - in - cheek .Obama detractors / Hillary supporters see it as arrogant , presumptuous , and out - of - line .It 's all about perspective .On another note , the trend I seem to be seeing is that Republicans are extremely unlikely to vote for Hillary , ever .But I know of several Republicans that would vote Obama if it came down to Obama / McCain .Anyone else notice something similar , at least among Republicans ?Obviously , my polls are a little skewed , haha , but I thought it was interesting regardless .Lisa : \" Apparently you did n't hear the CNN statistics .25 % of Hillary voters would vote for McCain before Obama .Wake up !The democrats will lose if Obama is the democratic candidate .\" I will never vote for Hillary Clinton .My wife will never vote for Hillary Clinton .And the rest of my family will never vote for Hillary Clinton .And every single Republican in the United States has been waiting for YEARS to cast a vote against that woman .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.85976"}

{"text":"In DEV it is ok .But not for PROD , it would break .Thanks for the reply , But I do n't think I have explained my problem fully , because ...I can see the admin list no problem , and can add to this list too .My problem is that I am not sure if this account allows multiple domains ? and not sure how to check whether or not multiple domains is allowed by the same key?I presume that - because it lets me add multiple domains - multiple domains should be possible with this account ?In Step 5 above it says : .Select the \" Enable this key on all domains ( global key ) \" so you can use the same reCAPTCHA key for all your sites .I am not sure if this option was enabled on set up - to allow for multiple domains ?So I am trying to find out if the problem is with Google CAPTCHA set up or at our end .update , just found out that someone has used another set of keys , so this problem is at our end .Although it would be nice to know if it is possilbe to find out whether or not an account has been set up to allow for multiple domains .Our terms : We reserve the right to edit or delete any comment , so please post thoughtfully .We use your email address only to send you a one - time verification message confirming that you posted this comment .We also store your address to allow you to verify using other Web browsers in the future .For more info , see our privacy policy .The reCAPTCHA service that helps Web sites tell humans and computers apart has been acquired by Google .Started by Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor Luis von Ahn , the company feeds out millions of distorted images a day that deter malicious or commercially motivated automated behavior .Von Ahn and colleagues came up with the term CAPTCHA ( a contrived acronym for \" Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart \" ) , wrote an early paper on the topic , and have continued to advance the academic and practical elements .A CAPTCHA is a puzzle that humans can solve relatively easily but that stymies computers ; it 's used as a type of Turing test .Alan Turing 's famous test involved two parties , one a computer , attempting to convince a human interlocutor of their respective humanity .With CAPTCHAs , an automated system feeds out what are typically hard problems in artificial intelligence - still mostly centered on machine vision and text recognition - to ferret out faux folk .The reCAPTCHA approach is particularly interesting , because it relies on a large base of scanned words that have failed separate attempts at optical character recognition by two different systems .The source scans include a commercial project for The New York Times to turn its vast archives into text .Such OCR - resistant words are perfect puzzles for humans , and they 're helpful for fixing what are called \" suspect \" words in OCR .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"98.751205"}
{"text":"So now the question is : how do we go about this ?If there is a BIG - IP already in the infrastructure we could use it to serve our challenge and authorize our users .While iRules is the most advanced traffic processing and manipulation platform around today , it does not shine at generating images .This left us scratching our heads for a few days trying to figure out how we would generate challenge efficiently and dynamically .Enter Google reCAPTCHA .Google 's reCAPTCHA project is a cleanly packaged CAPTCHA API that operates entirely over HTTP .It was developed to perform two important functions : verifying human interaction and human - operated OCR ( optical character recognition ) .While CAPTCHAs are an annoyance to some users , Google is putting all that seemingly wasted dictation to good use .Current print works undergoing digitization by the reCAPTCHA project include The New York Times and the e - Books offered by Google Books ( a portion of which are free ) .Google estimates that 150,000 work hours each day are spent solving CAPTCHAs .reCAPTCHAis an exemplary model of crowdsourcing in practice .While the goodwill and crowdsourcing aspects of reCAPTCHA could lead to late night philosophical conversations about the future of the Internet , we are more interested in implementing the API in iRules .Let 's begin by discussing how we go about serving a CAPTCHA challenge , ingesting the response , verifying the response , and finally providing passage or denial to our user .This mechanism is facilitated by an key pair obtained from Google .When an unapproved user accesses a protected resource he will receive the CAPTCHA page containing a form which has a small amount of code provided by Google .Within that code there is javascript and an iframe ( for users without javascript ) .The source links of the javascript and iframe reference the public key provided by Google as a GET variable .The CAPTCHA will then be served by Google with the image and an important hidden form field named \" recaptcha_challenge_field .\" The \" recaptcha_challenge_field \" hidden field contains the correct response to the CAPTCHA encrypted with your public key .The user then type his response to the CAPTCHA in to the \" recaptcha_response_field \" text field and submits it for verification .The server receives the response request and assembles a POST request containing the private key ( privatekey ) , the user 's IP ( remoteip ) , the encrypted challenge field ( challenge ) , and the user 's response ( response ) .These four fields are submitted to Google and the response is verified .Google can return any number of reasons for failure ( bad request , bad keys , incorrect response , unmatched remote IP , etc . ) , but will return \" success \" in the body if everything proceeds correctly .Below is a diagram of all the steps involved in presenting and verifying a CAPTCHA challenge with a BIG - IP : .Sideband connections for iRules were introduced in BIG - IP version 11 .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"100.5891"}
