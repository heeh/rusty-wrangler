Jensen .The post was organized 90 years ago in the fall of 1919 and has existed ever since .The memorial honors both those who are living as well as those who are no longer living , \" Simmons said .\" It 's everyone who was in the service .Simmons said he got the idea for the statues when he traveled through Herreid , S.D. , a couple years ago and saw its veterans wall with statues like the ones Ryder now has .\" It looks like they ( the soldier statues ) are guarding it . \"he said .He did n't have a camera with him on that trip but on his next trip through there he brought along a camera and took photos of the statues , then brought the idea back to the Ryder American Legion post members .Donations paid for the statues , which were made in Sioux Falls , S.D. The statues were ordered this spring and delivered just in time on a Monday just before the community 's annual celebration held in mid - July .I wanted them in place for the celebration , \" Simmons said .The concrete statues have a bronze coating .One is a Vietnam - era soldier and the other is a Korean - era soldier , \" Simmons said .He said these particular statues are fitting for the monument because they portray soldiers with guns or guarding the memorial .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"42.469643"}
{"text":"The most recent military memorial in San Antonio is the sculpture dedicated to Vietnam veterans in front of the Municipal Auditorium .It portrays a radioman leaning over a fallen comrade , his face stark with horror .There is heroism here , but certainly no glory .These days abstract sculpture at least has the advantage , which it once did not , of being safe .It is unlikely to excite political or racial trouble ; in fact the least care taken in selecting a sculpture will ensure that it wo n't upset anyone .Furthermore , if the sculpture is by a famous artist , it can not be effectively criticized on the grounds of taste , except in the private , grumbling comments of common folk , who can be ignored .All of that makes abstract sculpture the perfect aesthetic product for the people who pay for most public sculpture today , namely developers and chairmen of corporations .They know that the tenor of the age prevents them from erecting statues to themselves , although I think the results might be intriguing if they would , and a statue of anyone else seems perilous at best .Who would it be ?Better to put some shape out there and be done with it .So it is a peculiarity of our time that only in a pleasant but somewhat remote corner of an amusement park , almost a mile from Shamu , can one find a monument to the people that a Texan might consider heroic .As art , several of the statues on the Texas Walk seem very fine to me , others perhaps something less , and at least one an utter failure .But when abstract sculpture fails as art , it commands no interest whatsoever , whereas here one finds oneself still absorbed with the subjects .Lyndon Johnson stands confidently , his weight on his left foot , his Stetson held in his right hand and resting against his thigh .His shoulders are square , and he looks straight ahead as if he were certain that he could prevail over anything he might see .That all seems true enough , but he also looks at peace with himself , as if no internal demons plague him .Is that right ?It 's a question I 've been pondering ever since .In the oil fields Howard Hughes , the father , wore a tie tucked military fashion into the front of his shirt , and and that 's how he is portrayed in his statue .He is holding at his side the drill bit he invented that was the foundation of his fortune .He is wearing workman 's gloves , his sleeves are rolled up , and the veins in his forearms are bulging .He looks hardworking , lean , sweaty , competent , and in command .Are corporate CEOs still like that ?Katherine Anne Porter , diminutive and pretty , is descending a pair of steps .She is wearing pearls , a straw hat , and a full skirt that furls slightly in the breeze , suggesting a ladylike sexuality .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"42.85144"}

Sherrod Brown 's office earlier this year about doing something nationally to recognize Gold Star fathers .The result is the Gold Star Fathers Act of 2014 , which would give Gold Star fathers of deceased or permanently and totally disabled service members the same 10-point hiring preference for federal employment that is currently given to Gold Star mothers , and unmarried widows and widowers .When Brown introduced the proposal last month , he said , \" By extending federal preference eligibility to fathers , we are righting a wrong that should have been corrected many years ago . \"He recently said that although many people are probably more familiar with Gold Star mothers , \" fathers should also be recognized for their sacrifice and loss .\" A similar proposal introduced in the U.S. House last year has won the support of the 2,000-member American Gold Star Mothers Inc. , according to Becky Christmas , national parliamentarian and legislative chairman for the group .Christmas said the Gold Star Mothers ' national executive board voted in February to support extending the federal hiring preference to Gold Star Fathers .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"46.73227"}

Nov. 11 is a very significant date in American history .Today we celebrate it as Veterans Day .Veterans Day is a holiday to celebrate and remember all of the people who have served , who have died while serving , and who are now serving their country .We honor our veterans on Nov. 11 because The Armistice was signed by the Germans in 1918 on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month .This signified the end of World War I. .Veterans Day was originally named Armistice Day by President Woodrow Wilson .Armistice Day was also known as Remembrance Day .He did not however make it an official holiday .The first Armistice Day was Nov. 11 , 1919 .The United States Congress passed a concurrent resolution on June 4 , 1926 , asking President Calvin Coolidge to observe Armistice Day as a legal holiday .An act of Congress on May 13 , 1938 , made Nov. 11 a legal holiday .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"67.85547"}

{"text":"The vision of this project as we understand it , was to replicate a replica , and do this in such a way that the new version retained the artistic merits of the original while incorporating design elements that would ensure it a long healthy life .This new statue would then be installed in an appropriate setting designed to blend with the current park while being a significant upgrade .The original replica was placed here by the Boy Scouts in 1952 , only 66 years after the dedication of the Statue of Liberty in New York harbor which has become an international symbol of freedom .The Statue should always be a reminder of the best our country has to offer its old and new citizens .We recently took another look at the Ken Burns PBS special on the Statue of Liberty .A similar dispute arose in the mid 1880 's over providing an appropriate base / pedestal for the Statue of Liberty which itself was a gift to the United States from the people of France .Eventually private donations from many citizens funded the construction of the present site on Liberty Island .My wife and I hope that this local vision is not snuffed out by a misplaced sense of expediency , while understanding the realistic nature of budgets and timelines .It is in that spirit that we offer the following comments / suggestions .Priority should be placed on requiring an accounting from Northwest Program for the Arts .How many bricks were sold ?( As of 7/31/2007 they are still asking the public to purchase these bricks on their web site ) .What was the total of donations received ?How was this money spent and how much is left ?This will establish a current baseline enabling a realistic assessment of the money needed to complete the project .It would also be in the interest of the NPA to clarify the situation and hopefully establish their credibility as they solicit donations for future projects .Without some form of closure for those who have already donated and a demonstration of accountability for prospective donors , it might be difficult to generate additional funds .Give the Seattle Statue of Liberty Committee - Phase II , organized by Libby & Paul Carr , a fair chance to get on track and see what develops .The city should work with their organization as quickly as possible to avoid further delays with the accompanying rise in costs .Find a way to address the concerns of those who feel the statue has already been gone long enough .For long time residents who have watched the ups and downs in the Statue 's history , the temptation is to feel enough is enough .They , with good reason , just want the statue back as soon as possible .Would it be possible to bring the new statue back to Alki to be on display for the community while it awaits the completion of its new home ?Would the new Alki Bathhouse be a viable site ?A small exhibit could be set up displaying the history of the Statue and providing ways that interested individuals could participate in the process .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"70.363235"}

{"text":"For Immediate Release : November 28 , 2011 .( Paris , TX )Veterans Day festivities may have now ended , but Lone Star Legal Aid continues our mission to honor veterans and service members by partnering with private attorneys to increase legal services for low - income veterans and service members .It is an unfortunate reality that countless Texas military veterans and their dependents have serious legal problems , and , like other low - income Texans , can not afford to hire an attorney .To help Texas lawyers serve an often - overlooked population , Lone Star Legal Aid 's Paris Branch office is conducting a half - day continuing legal education ( CLE ) event for Texas attorneys .The CLE will take place December 2 , 2011 from 1:00 - 5:00 at the Lamar County Court House located at 119 North Main in Paris .\" These are critically difficult economic times where resources are scarce and our client population 's needs continue to multiply , \" said Kristy Rodgers , Branch Manager for Lone Star Legal Aid 's Paris office .\" Many veterans come to our office in need of help on a range of simple to complex and urgent legal matters , but Legal Aid simply can not serve every one .This harsh reality makes our partnerships with private attorneys so valuable because they help ensure that more low - income Texans have access to justice .We are grateful to be expanding partnerships to help expand legal services for low - income Texans , \" Ms. Rodgers continued , \" especially for our men and women veterans who served our country so bravely .The CLE is free for Texas attorneys who agree to accept at least one civil case from Lone Star Legal Aid for a low - income Texas veteran on a pro bono basis .Attorneys who attend the event can earn up to 4 hours of CLE credit from the State Bar of Texas .The event will be moderated by Lamar County Judge Bill Harris .The program will include an overview of Veteran Benefits , federal and state protections for active service members and other issues of interest to attorneys serving veterans such as IRS considerations .For more information or to RSVP contact Lone Star Legal Aid 's Paris Office at 903 - 785 - 8711 .Lone Star Legal Aid is a 501(c)(3 ) organization that has been addressing the unmet legal needs of financially - distressed Texans for over 60 years in Southeast Texas through a combination of staff and volunteer legal professionals .As the fourth - largest legal aid organization in the U.S. , it serves 72 counties in Texas from Matagorda to Texarkana and 4 counties in southwest Arkansas .Lone Star Legal Aid 's \" Lone Star Lawyers for Lone Star Veterans \" initiative engages Lone Star Legal Aid staff , community partners and pro bono attorneys to honor veterans and service members by providing them free legal advice , advocacy and education regarding their rights and protections .Lone Star Legal Aid 's Longview office conducts a weekly veterans ' legal services clinic as a part of this goal to increase legal services to low income Texas veterans .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"89.18334"}
{"text":"One of the reasons the Texas Walk has such a powerful effect is that seeing a modern portrait statue , much less sixteen of them , is a rare event .In Texas , according to an unpublished inventory by Carol Little of Longview , some 692 sculptures have been commissioned for public spaces since 1960 .About half were realistic , and half were abstractions .In public areas in front of important buildings , the sculptures are inevitably abstract .That is the result of the last one hundred years of artistic styles and theory .The heroic statue of a man on horseback has long been a rarity , and statues commemorating some eminence are equally scarce in cities , although they are still popular in small towns .During the boom , every major building was incomplete without an abstract sculpture from a famous artist .Thus , the plazas of Texas are littered with the work of Jean Dubuffet , Claes Oldenburg , Louise Nevelson , the ubiquitous Henry Moore , and many others .The most spectacular triumph of all is Personage and Birds , by Joan Miró , which stands , sassy and brilliantly colored , in front of the Texas Commerce Tower in Houston .Also in Houston is one indisputable masterpiece , Barnett Newman 's Broken Obelisk , on the grounds of the Rothko Chapel .Other modern pieces range from the very good down to a couple of clear disasters .But even assuming that these abstractions were all the greatest works from the greatest artists , would n't there still be room - wouldn't there still be a need -for public portrait sculpture of notable men and women ?Such monuments are a way of saying to ourselves and to the future , \" This is what we looked like , this is what we did , and these are some of the people who were important around here . \"Still , artists who concentrate on portrait commission find it nearly impossible to earn any recognition from the art establishment .But their work is not in any major art museum in Texas or elsewhere ; they are most likely unknown and certainly thought to be beneath consideration by serious students of contemporary American art .Although they sell to famous collectors - Dolph Briscoe , John Connally , Burt Reynolds , Winthrop Rockefeller , Jr. , Richard Nixon , Bill Hobby , and former Mexican president José López Portillo - those collectors are famous for reasons other than their taste in art .For the first fifty years of this century almost all statues in public places were portrait statues .They were of veterans or local or national heroes or simply a rich and powerful citizen who had left his mark on a town .They were paid for by veterans or civic groups .The grandest example of pure hero worship is the cenotaph in the plaza in front of the Alamo with its idealized portraits of Travis , Bowie , Crockett , and Bonham .One can only begin to imagine the political wrangling and name - calling that would be prompted if that memorial were to be built today .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"89.51343"}
{"text":"Thank you for hearing me out .Zavaleta is most certainly a qualified academic researcher , and there is no justification for calling that into question ( because it is easily verified by anyone who genuinely wants to know ) .That being said , most academics pass their entire careers without much , if any , public notice of their work .In every field , however , there are certain researchers who , for one reason or another , frequently end up with their names in print and their faces on TV .( The name \" Ronald Hutton \" comes to mind . )While this is neither good nor bad in and of itself , it is completely reasonable to ask , why this particular researcher and not some other ?Kilmrnock .I do n't question his qualifacations ................ but what is his degree in and what kind of research does he do .Dr Laura has a degree in literature , but on her show she acted like her degree was in phsycology .If his degree is in archeology or anthropology why is he speaking about religion for , and are his views religisly skewed?His qualifications donot make him a \" occult expert \" a troublesome term to use in the first place .An anthropologist is not a religion expert .Jay .Whether or not this is the case , I do n't know , but it 's certainly not out of the realm of possibility .Kilmrnock .My point is the so called expert does n't seem to know his butt from a hole in the ground when it comes to Santa Muerta .His views seem to be based on Christian Propaganda .He does n't appear to be an expert on mexican syncretic religions .Just as all the other \" occult experts \" were how can i say this politly were full of shyte .Otherwise an expert would have known what the statue was actualy for .I am far from an expert , even in my own beliefs , but even i know a little about Santa Muerta , and their funiary beliefs , day of the dead , etc . .Kilmrnock .I too find the whole occult expert term used in the article disturbing .Just as his discribtion of what the statues purpose is .We do have to give them credit for talking to you , but the inaccurances stated in the article wern't corrected .Rev. Telkal .I 've researched Paranormal activities and \" Occult \" findings for years , and I have always refused to be referred to as an \" Occult Expert \" .Anyone that does so is coming with an agenda , especially if from a Monotheist background .Also , any newspaper that runs a story without two sides of an unknown story is very poor journalism .Today news papers are always trying to get their story out first , instead of getting together as many facts as possible .I also believe that every single story that uses the word \" Occult \" should explain that the meaning of the word is \" Unknown \" versus \" Evil \" and therefore should not be used to create hysteria .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"90.0681"}
