{"text":"If it were internalized by a Romney administration , it would be a step in the right direction .Still , the essay goes awry in significant ways .Let 's start with the authors ' intimation that \" religious fanaticism \" causes terrorism .To be sure , that 's a better explanation than the Left 's \" blame America first \" approach .Yet , it still misses the mark .The real cause is ideology , not religion .The distinction is worth drawing because , for the most part , Islamist terror is not fueled by Muslim zealousness for Islam 's religious tenets - for instance , \" the oneness of Allah .\" We Westerners recognize such beliefs as belonging to the realm of religion or spirituality .To the contrary , Islamist terror is driven by the supremacism and totalitarianism of Middle Eastern Islam - i.e. , by the perception of believers that they are under a divine injunction to impose all of Islam 's tenets .Most of those tenets do not concern religion or spirituality , at least not as Westerners interpret those concepts .Instead , sharia is largely concerned with controlling what we see as secular affairs - political , social , military , financial , jurisprudential , penal , even hygienic matters .Of course , the fact that we separate church and state in the West does not mean our moral sense is without influence - indeed , profound influence - over how we conduct secular affairs .But in the West , we reject the notion that any religious belief system 's tenets should control those affairs .In the United States , we reject the establishment of a state religion - such official primacy would suffocate freedom of conscience , a bedrock of liberty .By contrast , the foundation of Middle Eastern Islam is submission to Allah 's law , not individual liberty .This interpretation of Islam thus rejects a division between the secular and the spiritual .Its sharia system contemplates totalitarian control .That makes Islamist ideology ( i.e. , Islamic supremacism , or what is sometimes more elliptically called \" political Islam \" ) just another totalitarian ideology , albeit one that happens to have a religious veneer .Some of my friends make the error of claiming that \" Islam is not a religion .\" I understand what they mean - it is a clumsy way of making the point that mainstream Islam aspires to control much more than spiritual life .Still , the clumsy rhetoric is a bad mistake , driving a wedge between what should be natural allies : those fearful of Islamic supremacism and religious believers .The latter - for example , American Christians , Jews , and non - Islamist Muslims - today find their core liberties under siege by government overreach and atheist hostility .How convenient for these aggressor forces if , by the hocus - pocus of denying an established creed the status of religion , its adherents may be stripped of their constitutional protections .No , Islam clearly is a religion , and its theological tenets are every bit as deserving of the First Amendment 's guarantees as any other .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"37.467567"}

{"text":"But the Sunnis recognize before Ali the legitimacy of the first three caliphs - Abu Bakr , Umar and Uthman - who de facto rejected the claim of Ali 's supremacy , along with the many other early Muslims besides who supported their caliphates .In invoking the model of the Salaf as - Salih , therefore , Sunni Islamism brought to the forefront the historical circumstances that eventually led to the division of Sunnis and Shiites , and the original quarrels which energized the hostility between them .Since Shiites detest and even publicly revile the first three caliphs , as well as others of the Salaf , the general orientation of modern Sunni Islamism was bound to deepen the already potent divide between it and Shiism , including Shiite Islamism .On the other hand , there have been those within the Sunni Islamist universe - most notably , among the Muslim Brotherhood - who have periodically adopted a more conciliatory , even ecumenical approach toward Shiite Islamism .The basis for this approach derives in part from the contemporary experience common to all Muslims - that is , from the common decline in their worldly fortunes , a problem that Islamism , in both its Sunni and Shiite varieties , have both sought to overcome through reforming Islam .Sunni and Shiite reformers and radicals also had common enemies closer to home - the autocratic , modernizing and secularizing regimes of the Muslim world that had been established in the aftermath of WWII .The reformers regarded these regimes as totally inappropriate to the requirements of Islamic politics and religion .In their view , another model for Muslim political life - the \" Islamic State , \" which was to be governed entirely though and by Islamic law - was required .The conflict between the Islamists and the new secular governments routinely led to harsh repression of the Islamists , which had the effect of enlarging the latter 's sense of grievance and hostility .In these dire circumstances , a certain Sunni - Shiite Islamist fellow feeling became possible .This was somewhat enhanced as a consequence of the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the founding of the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .Among the reasons was the fact that the Islamic Republic represented a form of the \" Islamic State , \" and hence , represented the achievement of a goal that inspired Islamism as a whole .Of course , Iran came to be governed by Shiite rather than Sunni law , and in that respect , many Sunni Islamists viewed it as repugnant or corrupt .Moreover , prior to the Islamic revolution , Iran was a large , powerful state that had been on the road to ever greater secularization - a process distressing to all Islamists - and that was also an ally of the hated United States and West .The extraordinary reversal of these circumstances in 1979 seemed to demonstrate to the Sunni Islamist movement that similar successes were not impossible for them .Khomeini himself attempted to reach out to Sunni Islamists in this spirit , and early on enjoyed some brief success .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"52.18584"}

{"text":"In the years since the revolution , the formation of a new Shiite clerical hierarchy and the increasing concentration of power in the office of the supreme leader and jurist have rendered it increasingly difficult for clerics to register even mild criticisms of the Islamic regime in public .In fact , for a cleric to oppose the supreme leader and the religious hierarchy is seen as tantamount to dissenting politically with the most fundamental principle and institution of the theocratic regime itself - i.e . , the absolute authority of the jurist .The further institutionalization of the Islamic hierocracy has been reinforced by cultural practices within the Shiite community as well .Traditionally , Shiite jurists sought to avoid public disputes among themselves over non - scholarly issues as a way of pretending that they were pious and did not care about worldly affairs , only higher ones .While they openly squabbled amongst themselves over scholastic matters , the clerical community strived to portray itself to society at large as united on virtually all matters of consequence .In addition to this , there are other important factors why clerics have generally been reluctant to publicly oppose or criticize the Islamic Republic .First of all , the supreme leader or jurist was declared to be a jurist unlike any other .To enforce his rule within the hierocracy , the supreme leader is able to exert his authority through a range of coercive instruments - including , perhaps most notoriously , through a body known as the \" Special Court of Clerics \" ( Dadgah - e Vizheh - ye Rowhaniyat ) .This special court operates under the direct supervision of the supreme leader , and it does not follow the juridical procedures and laws of the rest of the country .Since its establishment , the court has become well - known for its brutal and humiliating treatment of clerics of all ranks .For example , Ayatollah Shariatmadari was \" tried \" in this court .He was accused of being involved in a military coup to overthrow the regime and assassinate Khomeini , when in fact his real \" crime \" was attempting to challenge Khomeini 's legitimacy as a ruling jurist .His dossier was closed after many of his followers and relatives were arrested or executed , and Shariatmadri himself was shown on state television making a \" confession \" and begging for Khomeini 's pardon .In addition to the special court , the Islamic regime has developed a range of other techniques for enforcing its rule within the clerical establishment .Among other things , the Islamic regime claimed direct responsibility for the day - to - day management of clerical institutions , and this fundamentally altered the clergy 's access to financial resources .9 To begin with , the Islamic government confiscated much of the property that belonged to Iran 's traditional religious authorities .In turn , this property was placed under the control of the supreme leader .For example , Dar al - Tabligh ( the House of [ Islamic ] Propaganda ) , which was owned by Ayatollah Shariatmadari , became a base for Daftar - e Tablighat - e Eslami - e Qom ( the Office for Islamic Propaganda ) , the head of which is appointed by the supreme leader .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"61.310013"}

{"text":"Khomeini went so far as to enshrine this principle - the principle of expediency - in the state itself through the establishment of the Expediency Council .All of this was justified through the absolute independence of authority that , on the basis of the principle of the rule of the jurist , was conferred upon the newly created office of the Rahbar or Supreme Leader .Some of Khomeini 's supporters went further by suggesting the possibility that Khomeini was himself the Imam - which meant , among other things , that he was morally and politically infallible .At all events , even after Khomeini 's death , his prestige became the basis for further innovations in Shiism .Most noteworthy was the status of his fatwas , or legal rulings .Traditionally , Shiite legal doctrine had affirmed the view that a jurist 's rulings lapsed with his death .That principle was declared to be inapplicable to Khomeini 's jurisprudence .( The most famous example was the fatwa Khomeini pronounced against the author Salman Rushdie , which is still in principle in effect to this day . )But Khomeini 's most general and important legacy was that the Islamic Republic and its requirements were to be definitive to Shiite Islamism 's future .Of course , in the aftermath of Khomeini 's death , the most important issue was who was to succeed him as Supreme Leader .Khomeini himself had made provision for that by designating Ali Khamenei as his successor .The significance of this appointment lay in the fact that Khamenei , while a jurist , was unlike Khomenei in that he was not an ayatollah - or for that matter , not even an acknowledged jurist of the first rank .Notwithstanding this , Khomeini chose Khamenei as the person he considered most trustworthy to continue his governance .It appears , therefore , that even the definition of the \" jurist \" and his \" rule \" could breach the limits of Shiite tradition and its institutions .The net result of this is that Shiism - or rather , Shiite Islamism - is now , in principle , a function of Iran 's politics , both domestic and foreign , and is somewhat indeterminate .One powerful expression of this was the election and rule of the first non - cleric - Mahmud Ahmadinejad - as Iran 's president in 2005 .Lacking clerical credentials , Ahmadinejad in pursuit of various political ends has invoked the only authority that might trump the rule of the jurist - that of the Hidden Imam itself .Of course the president remains subject to the authority of Khamenei as Supreme Leader , as well as to various clerical bodies enshrined in the constitution .He is also opposed by other important figures and groups within Iran 's political - religious establishment .Nevertheless , all this points to the fact that the definition of Shiite Islamism is an evolving phenomenon ; one might say Shiite Islamism is now what Shiite Islamism does - or will do .What it has been doing is the subject of the articles in this volume .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"62.883934"}

{"text":"\" This war , in fact , comprised three separate civil wars .The most crucial of these wars for subsequent Muslim history was the war between Ali and Muawiyah , who was then governor of Syria as well as kinsman to Uthman , the 3rd caliph , who had been murdered by Muslims who were discontented with his administration .Among the causes of this war and its ostensible pretext was Muawiyah 's demand , as near kinsman to Uthman , that justice be done in the case of his murder .Another factor was Muawiyah 's desire to be maintained in his office and , in general , for his clan 's interests to be preserved .During this war Ali was murdered .Although this murder was not at Muawiyah 's hand , he was the main beneficiary .It permitted him , in fact , to assert a claim to the caliphate and to maintain it .In the event , it led to the establishment of the caliphate as a familial dynasty , known historically as the Ummayyad dynasty , which ruled the Muslim empire from 661 to 750 .This familial usurpation of the right to rule only compounded the sense of injustice felt by the partisans of Ali , as did the fate of some of Ali 's heirs and their partisans who resisted the Ummayyad ascendancy .Beginning in 680 and until the end of Ummayyad rule , several revolts were mounted , all of which were ultimately defeated .The most consequential for later Shiite - especially Twelver - sensibilities was the revolt of 680 mounted by Ali 's son Hussain , which as mentioned earlier , ended in his murder near Karbala .But other revolts were also important , as they produced new understandings of the Alid claimants and their fates .The most important of these understandings for subsequent history as a whole was the doctrine of the Mahdi or Hidden Imam , which first emerged in connection with a revolt that took place in 683 .According to this doctrinal perspective , the Alid claimant who had apparently been defeated , had in fact gone in to occultation and would shortly return as the Mahdi or redeemer .It appears that this continually renewed experience of new hope and defeat produced two abiding , related though sometimes conflicting Shiite sensibilities .The first was a utopian and often politically quite radical sensibility whose guiding motto was the ambition to \" fill all the earth with justice and equity as it is now filled with injustice and corruption .\" This remains the motto of Shiism today .But while some in these early years continued to work toward that end as an immediate goal through renewed revolts , the experience of defeat led others to defer its anticipated realization to some future unspecified time .This was especially true of the most important Shiite figure of the Eighth Century - the Sixth Imam , Jaafar As Sadik , who rejected the course of immediate revolt as well as the doctrine of the Hidden Imam .As one consequence of this Jaafari teaching , a living and visible person was necessarily the \" regnant \" Imam , even if that \" rule \" was incomplete .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"67.67471"}
{"text":"However , a tendency to regard Ali and the subsequent Imams as the continuation of prophecy , and as Muhammad 's near equals in this regard , subsequently emerged among the adherents of Ali .In time , this was more formally articulated in one of Shiism 's central tenets mentioned above : the belief in the perfect wisdom and moral infallibility of the Imams .However , it is believed among Shia that Ali and his heirs did enjoy the same privileged access to wisdom and understanding that Muhammad had , including the privileged understanding of the law .This understanding of the status of Ali and his rightful heirs appears to have been first directly articulated by the Sixth Imam , Jaafar as - Sadik , who died in 765 .In the course of general Shiite history - though not Twelver Shiite history - even the remaining distinction between Muhammad and the Imams was sometimes breached .At certain times , for instance , radical Shiite groups emerged and attributed to the Imam that they recognized the right of the lawgiver .The leaders of these movements were thus capable of promulgating a new law , as well as of rescinding the old law .At all events , all forms of Shiism in effect affirm not only Ali 's unique right to rule but tend to understand rightful Islamic rule as a kind of continuation of prophetic rule .But as has been frequently said , Shiism involves not only a different political doctrine but a different religious sensibility , which receives powerful expression in its distinctive rites such as Ashura .This is , in part , a reflection of the unhappy experience of Ali 's partisans in adhering to and advancing their distinctive view of political and religious leadership .In the aftermath of Muhammad 's death , and during roughly the first century of the new Islamic empire , Ali 's unique claim to the caliphate did not achieve political success .His partisans necessarily regarded the rulers of the early Muslim empire as illegitimate .Moreover , they mounted relatively frequent attempts to overturn these rulers , all of which ultimately ended in defeat .The experience of these defeats served to aggravate Shiite indignation with the principled injustice of the denial of Alid rule .This provided Shiism with a sensibility of grievance and the longing for a redress of the series of injustices to which the Alids had been victims .These injustices began with the fate of Ali himself , and with the circumstances surrounding his rule as caliph .For Ali did in fact become caliph , though only after three other men held that office - Abu Bakr , Omar and Uthman .Ali succeeded them as the 4th caliph in 656 .If by strict Shiite principle even this delay was an injustice , it was the sad fate of Ali and his caliphate which , historically speaking , launched and inflamed Shiite sensibility .These circumstances , and the historical aftermath of the 1st century of Islam , thus require a brief elaboration .Although today all Sunni and Shiite Muslims recognize Ali as a rightful caliph , this was not the case at the time he assumed office as caliph .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"67.80936"}

{"text":"The Khomeinist Deterrence The Iranian revolution of 1979 is sometimes portrayed as representing a break with the traditional Shiite quietism .It is true that when Iran 's revolutionary rumblings began in the fall of 1978 , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini played every card in his hand to rally the masses against Shah Reza Pahlavi - including the use of subtle messianic references .Subsequently , Khomeini accepted the prestigious title of imam and even allowed his followers to indulge in messianic rhetoric .In one notorious example , Khomeini did not disavow the collective hallucination of November 27 , 1978 when thousands of his followers claimed to have seen Khomeini 's face in the moon .Since coming to power , however , the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran have generally sought to proscribe , or to at least deter , political messianism within their realm .In fact , as a matter of principle Khomeini adamantly opposed political mahdism : His break with the traditional Shiite clergy came not on the issues of messianism , but on the question of political power .During his exile from 1966 to 1978 in Najaf , Iraq , Khomeini developed his political doctrine of velayat - e - faqih , or rule of the Islamic jurist , while the Shiite clerical hierarchy based in Qom continued to advocate a centuries - old separation of religious and political authority .After the fall of the shah in February 1979 , the Islamic Republic was formed around a constitution that described its supreme leader as a representative of the Hidden Imam .This delegation of supernatural power to the head of state was in line with the dynastical legitimacy instituted by the Safavids .While the ayatollahs in Qom resented this confusion of powers , they shared Khomeini 's dislike for messianic excesses .No individual or sect had the right to challenge the occultation or decipher the signs .This was the privilege of the religious hierarchy , which prohibited any messianic attempt to \" accelerate \" the return of the apparition .The man who would replace Khomeini , Ali Khamenei , was a revolutionary cleric from Mashhad , in the Khorasan , where the Islamic Republic had boosted the pilgrimage to the shrine of the eighth imam , Reza .The Foundation of the Imam Reza had helped Khamenei in his ascension to power and , after being elected President of the Islamic Republic in 1981 , he was able to expand his power base outside of Khorasan .In Qom , the Ayatollah Muhammad Taqi Bahjat , along with his disciple Mesbah - Yazdi , supported him in his rivalry for power with other religious leaders .When Khomeini died in 1989 , Khamenei was upgraded as an ayatollah and appointed as Iran 's Supreme Leader .Ayatollah Khamenei has followed Khomeini 's repudiation of political mahdism .The next two men to succeed Khameini as president of the Islamic Republic , Ali Akbar Hachemi Rafsanjani ( 1989 - 1997 ) and Muhammad Khatami ( 1997 - 2005 ) , were even more hostile to political mahdism than their predecessors .But the 2005 election of Mahmud Ahmadinejad as President of Iran has undermined the mechanisms proscribing political mahdism within the Islamic Republic .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"68.948746"}

{"text":"Thus Sunni Islamism has had some impact on the generation and development of Shiite Islamism .In this light , it is not surprising that there are various commonalities between modern Sunni and Shiite Islamism .Among the most important is the fact that both Islamist movements were self - consciously devoted to an attack on tradition , and proposed radical new understandings in its place .Nevertheless , despite certain features common to both Sunni and Shiite Islamism - including borrowings from non - Muslim radical movements like Communism and Fascism - Shiite Islamism remains a separate phenomenon ; a distinct form of Islamism .Perhaps the most important factor distinguishing between the Sunni and Shiite Islamism are their respective approaches to tradition .Both Sunni and Shiite Islamism have proposed a radical departure from and transformation of their traditions .Nevertheless , the distinctive character of these traditions necessarily played a role in their transformations , if at some times only because they presented something different to be overcome .This , in turn , affected their respective ideological development and outcomes .In the case of Sunni Islamism , several strands within the tradition were given special emphasis at the expense of others .This special emphasis was in itself an expression of the radical departure from a practice that had generally embraced a variety of traditions - most famously by allowing adherence to any one of four legal schools .It was also relatively accommodating of a variety of theological traditions , especially of the mystical , Sufi variety .Sunni Islamism , by contrast , was and remains especially partial to one legal school - the Hanbali school , which is known for its particular austerity and harshness .Sunni Islamism has also been partial to a somewhat related tradition whose adherents are known as the Ahl al Hadith -the people of the Hadith ( or the accounts , reported on the authority of the Salaf , of the Prophet Muhammad 's sayings and doings . )The adherents of this tradition were characterized by a distrust of all Muslim literature other than the Qur'an and the Hadith , as they had been collected in major compendia .Sunni Islamism expressed its departure and critique of the historical tradition by privileging Hanbali jurisprudence and the Hadith .In so doing , it also revived the thought of certain leading classical authors , in particular the 13th century scholar , writer and polemicist Ibn Taymiyyah .The Sunni Islamist preoccupation with Hadith was a consequence of their invocation of the Salaf ; it also contributed to a general spirit among Sunni Islamists that sought to imitate the ways of the pious ancestors .Insofar as Sunni Islamism seeks to imitate the Salaf , it reaches back to a time before there was a \" tradition , \" and is thus radically untraditional in this sense .For reasons mentioned earlier , and especially because of the distinct distaste among Shiites for the Salaf except for Ali and his partisans , the issue of tradition was for the founders of Shiite Islamism almost necessarily the opposite of the Sunni Islamist view .Several more specific factors - both contemporary and ancient - were also involved in shaping the Shiite view of tradition .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"71.64042"}

{"text":"It was with this final restraint that Khomeini 's doctrine appeared to break , and indeed , this still appears to be the case to many quietist Shiites .This paradox within Shiism itself was the product of the tortured early experience of Ali and his partisans , and of the theological and political tensions to which this experience gave rise .This experience brought forth , in relatively equal measures , radicalism on the one hand and quietism on the other .Twelver Shiism , which for long periods would strive to place the emphasis on quietism , could not and did not become a fully articulated doctrine and sect until roughly the 10th and 11th centuries .For it was only at that point that the line of Twelve Imams was established with the disappearance of the final or Hidden Imam .Twelver Shiism was in part a product of the crisis produced by this final Imam 's disappearance - a crisis that represented a kind of culmination of more than 200 hundred years of travail for the partisans of Ali .Thus , Twelver Shiism represented from its inception an uneasy mixture of both radicalism and quietism , and because of this , it was a mixture potentially capable of disruption .In that respect , it was one expression of the dynamic tension of Shiism as it emerged in the first centuries of Islam .To better explain that tension it is necessary to consider briefly that early history , and the origins of Shiism .Shiism 's Origins and Distinctiveness The origins of Shiism 's distinctive views and claims lie in the immediate aftermath of the death in 632 of Prophet Muhammad , the founder of Islam , and the questions his death posed .Who was to succeed him as the new head of the Muslim polity ?How was he to be selected and what would be his status ?From a purely historical and non - religious perspective , the issue of Muhammad 's succession as well as the dispute - indeed , civil war - among early Muslims to which it gave rise may appear to be in essence a political dispute about office .This analysis would , however , be misleading .This is because the character of the Muslim founding stressed the unity of human affairs - including both political and religious affairs - in the light of the unity of God .Due to Muhammad 's role within the community he founded and ruled , and because this community did not distinguish between political and religious office , the dispute that ensued following the prophet 's death could easily , and eventually did , produce theological as well as political differences .Taken as a whole , Shiites believe that the only rightful heir of Muhammad as ruler or caliph of the Muslim polity was the prophet 's cousin and son - in - law Ali ibn Abu Talib .This right is believed to derive partially from a specific designation said to have been conferred upon Ali by Muhammad himself .But since this right was subsequently understood also to belong to Ali 's descendants , it pointed to the notion that there was something qualitatively different about Ali and at least some of his descendants , just as there had been something unique about Muhammad himself as prophet .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"73.060455"}
{"text":"This , plus other developments favorable to Shiism , placed the Abbasid caliphate and Sunnism generally on the defensive and has led the 10th century to be known as the \" Shiite Century .\" The political demise of Ismaili Shiism left , on balance , Twelver Shiism as the dominant form of Shiism .Paradoxically , its place in the Shiite world was reinforced by one other great eruption and success of a form of radical political Shiism : the founding of the Safavid Empire of Persia in 1501 .The Safavid movement which lay behind this empire emerged in Azerbaijan in the 15th century and espoused a mixture of Sufi and Shiite views .Its followers believed the head of the movement to be the incarnation of God .The founder of the Safavid state , Shah Ismail , did not reject the views of his most zealous followers .Nonetheless , at the founding of the state , he proclaimed an alternative doctrine - in fact that of Twelver Shiism - as the official religion of his new Persian domains , which had been heretofore largely Sunni .Shah Ismail and his successors thus undertook the forcible conversion of their subjects to Twelver Shiism , and in this project , they were assisted by Shiite clerics whom they were obliged to import from ancient centers of the Shiite community .This effort was ultimately successful , as today the vast majority of Iranians are Shiite .Moreover , the Safavid Shahs incorporated the Shiite clergy into the constitution and bureaucracy of the state , making them parties to its rule .This , too , was consequential in the long run .When the Safavid state came to an end in the early 18th century , the Twelver Shiite clergy continued to exercise important authority over the increasingly integrated and culturally homogeneous Shiite population .The clergy remained , so to speak , \" sub - political , \" but nonetheless powerful , as became clear during various Iranian political crises of the 19th and 20th centuries .During those crises , Shiite clerics sometimes played an important and even decisive role .Such was the religious state of affairs bequeathed to Ayatollah Khomeini on the eve of his revolution .The Khomeinist Revolution and its Aftermath As the preceding account serves to indicate , Shiism as a whole has had a certain tendency to produce political movements , including movements that have sought radical reform of existing political orders .This is , in a way , hardly surprising , given the fact that Shiism 's most fundamental and distinctive teaching concerns the issue of legitimate Muslim political rule .It must be noted that such radical religio - political reform movements are not unknown within Sunni history - for example , the North African Almohad movement and \" caliphate \" of the 12th century .This was , in part , the consequence of the great horror and trauma that the Sunni tradition had experienced during the Great Fitna .In fact , following the Great Fitna , Sunni jurists professed a willingness to accept , albeit with regret , illegitimate and even despotic rule , if the cost of an alternative form of rule promised to be intra - Muslim disunity and bloodshed .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"73.93239"}
