{"text":"A case in point occurred last Wednesday night , just hours after a gunman named Floyd Lee Corkins entered the headquarters of the FRC .It turns out that , as with the Family Research Council , what seems to qualify one for smearing by the Southern Poverty Law Center is disagreement with its political agenda .If you lawfully object to , say , the erosion of traditional marriage or open borders , you stand to be condemned by the SPLC as a hater .It seems that if you are militantly in favor of the radical homosexual agenda or racist groups like La Raza , however , you get a pass from that organization .Particularly striking in this regard is the utter blindness of the SPLC to the hatemongering in which Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist organizations in this country regularly engage .But those whose Islamic creed promotes hatred of other religions , man - made laws and people who embrace them are never mentioned as a problem .On Wednesday , August 15 th , the director of the SPLC 's \" intelligence project , \" Heidi Beirich , participated in an open conference call organized by one such Islamist group , the Muslim Public Affairs Council .She used the occasion to inveigh against anti - Muslim hate groups and to declare that her group was \" very , very concerned \" about their proliferation .What makes this performance absolutely bizarre is the fact that MPAC is not simply a Muslim Brotherhood - associated organization that , by definition , is in the business of promoting shariah 's virulently intolerant code .So egregious is Muslim Public Affairs Council 's record of hatemongering that an ecumenical group of seven leaders of national faith - based and civil rights organizations wrote the leadership of the Southern Poverty Law Center last week urging the SPLC not to associate with those Islamists .An attachment noted that an MPAC - sponsored event in December 2000 featured an exhortation from Imam Mohammed Al - Asi , a supporter of the quintessential Islamist hate group , Hezbollah , and director of the Islamic Education Center in Potomac .Only carrying arms will do this task .And it 's not going to be someone else who is going to carry arms for you and for me .It is you and me who are going to have to carry these arms .\" It is deeply regrettable that the Southern Poverty Law Center has been reduced to a propaganda arm of enemies of freedom .And the SPLC should abandon its odious practice of listing as hate groups those - like the Family Research Council - with whom it simply disagrees politically , and seeks to silence .The Southern Poverty Law Center is quick to allege ties between people it calls haters and people who use violence against the object of the purported hatred .If the SPLC is genuinely interested in preventing such behavior , then the organization and its leaders should stop what amounts to encouragement of it .The Southern Poverty Law Center ( ' SPLC ' ) newly released June \" Intelligence Report \" titled \" 30 New Activists Heading Up the Radical Right \" is another attempt by the Left to silence those who seek to educate the public on the Islamist threat .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"68.13364"}

{"text":"A detailed analysis of FBI statistics covering ten full calendar years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks reveals that , on a per capita basis , American Muslims , contrary to spin , have been subjected to hate crimes less often than other prominent minorities .Americans should keep these numbers in mind whenever Islamists attempt to silence critics by invoking Muslim victimhood .The federal government defines a hate crime as a \" criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender 's bias against a race , religion , disability , ethnic origin , or sexual orientation .\"Though statutes mandating harsher punishments for hatred - inspired acts raise the specter of thought crimes , emphasize group identity over the individual , and seemingly favor certain victims over others , the FBI 's tracking of such deeds shines important light on the state of the nation .Annual reports assembled from local law enforcement data are accessible on the website of the FBI 's Uniform Crime Reporting Program .Especially useful is Table 1 of each compilation , which summarizes the number of incidents , offenses , victims , and known offenders for hate crimes committed against members of different groups .Anti - Muslim incidents rose to 160 in 2010 , an increase that Islamists and their mouthpieces eagerly blamed on rampant \" Islamophobia , \" particularly opposition to a proposed giant mosque near Ground Zero .Based on freshly released FBI data , there was little change in 2011 , with 157 incidents , 175 offenses , 185 victims , and 138 known offenders .Note the key word : \" several \" in a country with at least 2,106 mosques , a few million Muslims , and 300 million - plus non - Muslims .As hinted above , the dark portrait of America as a nation of violent bigots uniquely hostile to Muslims does not withstand quantitative scrutiny .To smooth out year - to - year variations , consider the past decade ( 2002 - 11 ) of FBI - recorded hate crimes .There were 1,388 incidents against Muslims during this span , compared with 25,130 against blacks ; 12,030 against homosexuals and bisexuals ; 9,198 against Jews ; and 5,057 against Hispanics .Even majority whites endured 7,185 incidents , while Christians ( Protestants and Catholics combined ) were targeted in 1,126 incidents .Adherents of \" other religions \" faced 1,335 , very close to the anti - Muslim tally .Due to the different sizes of minority groups , however , raw numbers can not tell the complete tale .More insightful are per capita rates .Some back - of - the - envelope calculations follow .The U.S. Census Bureau derived the total , Hispanic , and black populations for 2000 and 2010 from direct counts .Approximating their evolution with linear models , one can obtain estimates for any non - census year and , most important , the 2002 - 11 averages : total ( 299.2 million ) , Hispanic ( 45.2 million ) , and black ( 37.4 million ) .Surveys indicate that around 3.5 percent of American adults identify as homosexual or bisexual ; applying this percentage to the total population gives a 2002 - 11 average of 10.5 million .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"82.97811"}

{"text":"Figures for 2000 vary ( 5.3 - 6.2 million ) , so for simplicity we set the average Jewish population between 2002 and 2011 at 6.2 million to account for moderate growth .The 2002 - 11 average is roughly 2.3 million Muslims .Adding the FBI data yields per capita frequencies of hate crimes for the past decade .Of the five main minority groups discussed above , Jews were most likely to experience hate crimes , with 14.8 incidents per 100,000 Jews annually .Homosexuals and bisexuals ( combined ) came next ( 11.5 ) , followed by blacks ( 6.7 ) , Muslims ( 6.0 ) , and Hispanics ( 1.1 ) .Rates for majority whites and Christians were much smaller .With hate crimes befalling Muslims far less often than they do Jews or homosexuals and bisexuals and slightly less often than they befall blacks , it is clear that anti - Muslim incidents are disproportionate to those targeting other minorities only in terms of the hype generated on their behalf .A closer look reinforces this conclusion .First , despite claims about a surge of prejudice , anti - Muslim hate crimes in 2010 and 2011 merely returned to the typical post-9/11 ( 2002 - 06 ) pace of 150 - 160 incidents per year .Further , a similar number of hate crimes in 2002 and 2011 implies a lower per capita rate in 2011 because of strong population growth .Second , what of the Muslim population estimate ?In hopes of inflating their presumed clout , Islamist groups routinely assert the existence of around 7 million American Muslims , three times as many as the more objective measurements .Note , however , that this Islamist - promoted figure actually would weaken their narrative of anti - Muslim hate crimes , because a higher population reduces the per capita frequency , thus painting them as even less significant in a statistical sense .Self - pitying Islamists also want us to forget that in spite of 9/11-related anger , anti - Jewish hate crimes outnumbered anti - Muslim hate crimes that year by more than two to one .Fourth , could incomplete data affect the finding that Muslims are victimized less often than many non - Muslim minorities ?Theoretically , yes , but evidence for this is scant .SPLC talking heads regularly cite a 2005 Justice Department study , using surveys of victims ' perceptions of whether prejudice had motivated crimes against them , to argue that the FBI underestimates overall hate crimes by an order of magnitude .Yet even if those claims are valid , nothing suggests that anti - Muslim crimes are more or less likely to be ignored than others , which would be necessary to alter the relative frequencies of hate crimes against different groups .Another source of incompleteness is that not all local law enforcement agencies take part in the FBI 's tabulation , but once again there is no obvious bias here that would preferentially diminish hate crimes against Muslims .Although this impact is probably small , it further chips away at the meme of rising hate .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"92.691246"}
