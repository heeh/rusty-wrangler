{"text":"( Additional reporting by Natalia Drozdiak and Stephen Brown ; Editing by Hugh Lawson ) .Read the original article on Reuters .Copyright 2013 .Follow Reuters on Twitter .Archive for the ' EU matters ' Category .But the consequences of Merkel 's madness will be felt Europe - wide .Germany paid a heavy price for the world wars .Only during Angela Merkel 's chancellorship were the loans for WWI reparations finally paid off .That cost , however , pales into insignificance compared with the legacy of the second War .The human and material losses were of course disastrous but perhaps the most lasting legacy was psychological : the national shame of the past and the consequent and reflexive determination - craving , even - to be a good global citizen and atone for the sins of the grandfathers .That impulse is the only rational explanation for Angela Merkel 's mad decision to invite a million unscreened asylum seekers and migrants into the country last year ( mostly in the last six months ) .It 's also presumably the reason why there 's been so little heated debate within the country about it - not something that would have happened in just about any other European country .The lack of debate can be put down to an extreme sensitivity about the mix of politics and race or culture ; again , a consequence of the post - war consensus .Hence the comment from Cologne 's mayor in the wake of what appears to have been mass criminality that any suggestions that the perpetrators might have been refugees were \" absolutely impermissible \" .Not inappropriate , not ugly , not wrong ( in either sense ) , not misguided : impermissible ; forbidden .Or , put another way , not breaking the taboo on commenting on race is seen by her as more important than freedom of speech , even if the comment is true .Were it just a single overly sensitive local politician , one could write it off but the comments and actions or inactions of too many others involved , apparently including police and media cover - ups , suggests that the mind - set extends well across Germany 's ruling classes .One can not , however , accept a million immigrants , whether refugees or migrants , in a year without expecting consequences .Tensions will arise from simple pressures on local services at one end , to the kind of culture - related problems seen across various European cities on New Year 's Eve , at the other .There will be a backlash ; all the more so if establishment figures pretend it is n't happening or blame the victims , as Cologne 's hapless mayor also did .It 's all very well to argue , rightly , that those involved were a small minority of Germany 's refugees ; the fact that the disturbances and assaults happened and are directly related to the migrant policy is all that matters .And therein lie the political consequences .The Schengen Area , one of the EU 's greatest achievements , is practically comatose .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"44.228092"}

{"text":"The book focuses on what is and is not recognizable , achievable , and actually won by and for feminist politics in Germany , but my aim is to illuminate more general processes of feminist transformation .The differences among systems as to which claims are radical and realizable emphasize politics as a struggle rooted in historically developed material and cultural conditions .WHY GERMANY ?The German case is distinctive in several ways .Most importantly for my argument , Germany is not a liberal state .Many of the ideas Americans find obvious , such as the central role of individual rights and equal economic opportunity in allowing women full participation in all the goods society offers , owe their prominence to the dominance of liberal political philosophy .Liberalism has not played as important a role in Germany as in the United states or even Britain .German politics has drawn on both conservative views of patriarchal authority and social democratic ideals of justice to forge a social welfare state that prioritizes family support and the social reproduction of the nation .This difference in the material and cultural meanings of the nation - state shapes the work cut out for feminists .Thinking about a nonliberal political context offers a way to theorize the differences in the struggles faced by women 's movements around the world .Germany is not a dominantly social democratic state like Sweden , nor an insistently secular one like France .After World War ii , West Germany called itself a \" social market economy , \" but the principles guiding its development owed more to Christian conservatism than to social democracy , and east Germany was created as a communist state .German social democrats have been more organized and influential than classical free - market liberals , but they have more often than not been in the political opposition ; explicitly Christian parties led the government in the West , and authoritarian socialism dominated in the east .Policies that encouraged women 's paid work and reduced the gender wage gap were much more difficult to realize in West Germany than in its Nordic neighbors , and east German policies that embraced gender - equality goals were discredited by their association with repressive government .The German struggle over a balance between religiously based conservatism and social democracy provides a model for thinking about feminism in many parts of the world .Where social democrats are presumed to be an ally , many of the priorities and struggles in women 's movement politics will be affected in ways that are unfamiliar , and hence neglected , in American theorizing about political mobilizations .Germany is also a federal state . its central government is limited in many ways , and its states have different traditions . in particular the states that were part of the formerly communist German democratic republic ( GDR ) are more secular and ambivalent about socialist legacies .They are now subordinate to a larger , more prosperous , powerful Western section that kept the name , nearly all the laws , and the self - concept of the federal republic ( FRG ) .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"65.49754"}

{"text":"The whipping up of prejudices , combined with the use of left - wing phraseology , went hand - in - hand with the building of armed fascist militias that were used to attack the workers ' movement , as well as the minorities that the fascists targeted .Rather than ' personalised ' violence though , this was mass violence and intimidation .Even at quite an early stage fascism in Germany and Italy was able to get backing from sections of big business , who saw the fascists as useful allies because they were prepared to carry out attacks on the working - class movement .How fascism first arose .A SERIES OF workers ' revolutions aimed at ending capitalism and establishing socialism had swept across Europe around the end of the first world war .In Russia the workers took power in 1917 and began to construct a new society , anticipating the spread of the revolution to more economically advanced countries .However , because of mistakes by the leaders of the young Communist Parties and betrayals by the leaders of the reformist Social Democratic Parties , the revolutions in other countries failed , and the workers were unable to take power .The enormous strength and power of the workers ' movement and the example of revolutionary Russia had drawn the middle layers in society behind the working - class .But as revolution after revolution failed to change society these middle layers - ruined by capitalism and the bosses ' war , beginning to despair of socialism - began to look for other alternatives .It was these middle layers - ex - army officers , small shopkeepers , farmers , officials etc - who the Nazis in Germany and the fascists in Italy were able to appeal to .The capitalist class in Europe was weakened by the war effort and under siege from their own populations .In Germany and Italy there was enormous political instability as one establishment party after another fell from government , unwilling to meet the demands of the workers and unable to defend the interests of their big business masters .When the fascists took power they did so with the reluctant backing of the majority of the ruling class .Because it had the active support of a mass movement , however , fascism in power was able to do what the regular state forces had been unable to achieve : destroy the workers ' movement in Italy and Germany for more than a generation .This was what big business had wanted .However , fascism was not under the direct control of the capitalists and , particularly in Germany , went far beyond defeating the workers ' movement .Mussolini invaded Abyssinia .The Nazis in Germany began to annex territories ( beginning with those with large German or German - speaking populations ) .They organised a detailed campaign of harassment , slave labour and imprisonment against those not considered part of the ' Aryan master race ' - including Romanies and Slavs - and then , finally , genocide against the Jews .These actions were not seen as a major problem by the capitalists internationally until the Nazis ' aggressive expansionist policy began to threaten the interests of larger imperialist countries such as Britain and France .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"83.76152"}

' ' Gillard was not at the event .She has hardly said a word since Rudd got his revenge .Her allies wo n't stay silent if , as every opinion poll and pundit predicts , Rudd loses .For a nation famous for bullish straight - talking , Australia 's election campaign is proving to be a surprisingly tentative affair .As Paul reported last week , Tony Abbott has the air of a man playing it safe .His coalition has maintained a poll lead for a long time , and neither Rudd 's return nor Abbott 's poor personal approval ratings have so far affected that headline voting intention .It 's a measure of what kind of campaign this is that one of the few sources of controversy is a proposal to buy up old fishing boats in Indonesia in order to prevent them being used by asylum seekers .This has not been a titanic clash of radical ideas ( though it 's worth noting that , unlike us , Australian politicians are able to seriously proposing a return to government surpluses during the next few years ) .Polling day is two weeks away , but the Liberal Party 's Tony Abbott would make it over the finishing line were the election held today , according to two separate polls .One was of the four most marginal sears held by the two main parties , published in the Australian Financial Review , which found that the partt would take at least five seats off Labour .The other , published in the Sydney Morning Herald , found that Labor would lose two other seats in New South Wales .Those results would take Abbott over the 76 seat - threshold which he needs to win the election outright .The Liberals currently have 72 seats and Labor 71 .Kerr clocked his relative popularity : \" Abbott has never been hugely liked .But Rudd - or as ordinary voters greet him , Kevin , is a different matter .\" Bloomberg quotes Penny Wong , the Finance Minister , as saying : \" There 's no doubt we 're still the underdog , and there 's no doubt that Tony Abbott , if the election was held on the day it was announced would be the prime minister . \"Voice of Australia reports that Abbott \" is on track to comfortably win \" , and that Labor 's support has fallen \" to its lowest level since Kevin Rudd 's return as Prime Minister \" .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.08778"}

{"text":"And both are wrong .UKIP does draw the protest vote .But the very character of the protest vote is changing .The traditional party of protest in Britain was , of course , the Liberal Democrats ( or the Liberals as they were before they got hitched to the SDP ) .Once the Liberal Democrats became part of the Coalition government after the 2010 election , they could no longer play this role .But something more fundamental has also changed .The protest vote is no longer about teaching the main parties a lesson .It is about disenchantment with , and disengagement from , the whole political process .Voters are not saying ' I am voting for another party at this election to make you listen to me ' .Increasingly many are saying , ' You will never listen to me , so there is no point in voting for you at all ' .As telling as the 23 per cent of the vote that UKIP won last week was the fact that none of the main parties gained more than 30 per cent .Given that the turnout at the election is estimated at around 31 per cent , it means that no party could attract the support of even ten per cent of eligible voters .Even allowing for the fact that turnout is often low at local elections , it is a startling expression of disdain for all the political parties .On the same day as the local elections was the South Shields by - election .In a safe Labour seat , UKIP came second , humiliating both the Conservatives , whose vote was cut by almost two - thirds , and the Liberal Democrats , who attracted just 352 votes , or 1.4 per cent of the electorate .But again , perhaps more significant than the almost 6000 votes that UKIP won was the fact that more than 38,000 people - 60 per cent of the electorate - did not bother casting a vote at all .Such disdain for the mainstream parties is not peculiar to Britain .Throughout Europe the postwar political system , built around a divide between social democratic and conservative parties , is breaking own .The weakening of the old parties has made room for a host of new ones , from the Front National in France to the True Finns , from the Italy 's Five Star Movement to Syriza in Greece .It has also created disenchantment with the very idea of politics .In this post - ideological age , politics has reduced largely to a question of management rather than of social transformation .Few mainstream parties possess any more a clear set of political principles .Technocrats have taken over the system .All this has deepened the disengagement of the public from the political process , and widened the gap between voters and the elite .That is why so many of the new groups position themselves as ' anti - political ' parties .That is also why it is wrong to see UKIP as simply leeching votes from the Conservatives .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"93.521866"}

{"text":"Saturday 's NPD march was authorised by the Berlin Interior Minister Ehrhart Körting , a member of the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) .The NPD had announced their intention of marching through the middle of Berlin and , in particular , through the Scheunenviertel , Berlin 's traditional Jewish centre .Thousands of anti - fascist demonstrators , as well as members of Berlin 's Jewish community , gathered in front of the city 's central synagogue in the Oranienburgerstrasse to protest the provocative neo - Nazi march on the Shabbat , the traditional Jewish day of prayer .After the demonstration had taken place , Körting admitted that he had , in fact , organised a secret route for the neo - Fascists some weeks ago .Thus on Saturday , in keeping with this secret deal made with Körting , the neo - Nazis did not march directly through the Scheunenviertel , but were allowed to demonstrate barely a mile away along the city 's Chauseestrasse and Nordbahnhof .The Nazis carried banners defending the role of the Wehrmacht in the Second World War and chanted nationalist slogans .Some slogans were aimed directly against the organiser of the Wehrmacht exhibition , Jan Philipp Reemtsma .At the same time , over 1,300 Berliners visited the Crimes of the Wehrmacht exhibition on Saturday to express their own solidarity with its organisers and protest the Nazi march .Many , however , claimed they had considerable difficulty reaching the exhibition because police had blockaded streets and railway stations throughout the city centre .The huge contingent of police kept the neo - Nazis and anti - fascist counter - demonstrators apart .However , under the impression that the NPD would be marching directly through the Jewish quarter , a large number of demonstrators gathered in front of the central synagogue .After some stones were thrown towards the massed ranks of police and a handful of protestors tried to push through police barricades , the police responded with a brutal assault , spraying the demonstrators - including many peaceful Jewish protesters , elderly people and young families - with water - cannon and tear gas .Representatives from the Jewish community and some local politicians attempted to intervene and restore order .Prominent Party of Democratic Socialism ( PDS ) member Gregor Gysi called for a de - escalation of the situation .Speaking through a police megaphone , Gysi defended the police , complaining , \" The police are being forced to bear the brunt of politically unresolved problems .\" Thirteen anti - fascist demonstrators were arrested in the course of the fray .As is usually the case with such neo - Nazi demonstrations , the right wing German press , the Berlin interior minister and other prominent politicians blamed left - wing and anarchist demonstrators for the violence .In fact the principle source for the heightened tensions on the day of the march was the Berlin Interior Ministry , which refused to make public its secret deal agreeing an alternative route for the fascist march .It is also well known that the Berlin police regularly use agent provocateurs that mingle with the demonstrators in order to provoke confrontations and create conditions where the police can crack down violently .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"105.541046"}
