Hassan , who filed for divorce .But it is not only husbands and fathers who have authority over women under Sharia law .As Darwish states , a man who knows how to play the system in a Sharia state can rape and abuse females of almost any age without consequence .Furthermore , Darwish shows , the various forms of formal and informal polygamy practiced in Sharia states poisons the relationship between husband and wife and feeds jihad by limiting the marriage choices of low - income men .Sharia law only restricts women in their sexual activities ; men - those of means , at least - are allowed a \" wife buffet \" of sexual choices .And there is no prohibition in the Qur'an for men with authority over them to sexually exploit very young female children - though you 'll be relieved to know that Iran 's Ayatollah Khomeni wrote that penetration of an infant is not recommended .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"43.02437"}

'fits us and [ the wearers of ] the jilbab ( the flowing cloak ) of Quraysh to a tree .By God if we go back to Medina , those who are stronger will drive out the weaker from it . \" ' Then he turned to his tribesmen who were with him and said : \" This is what you have done to yourselves !You allowed them to settle in your lands and divided your wealth with them .Had you kept from them what you had , by God they would have moved to lands other than yours \" .Very soon , these utterances of Abd Allah ibn Ubayy reached Muhammad who was then sitting with Umar b. Khattab .Umar was furious and sought Muhammad 's permission to kill Abd Allah ibn Ubayy forthwith .But Muhammad refused to permit him to do so , saying that slaying of Abd Allah ibn Ubay would simply aggravate the situation further by angering the Ansars .To placate the situation , and to avoid bloodshed , Muhammad then ordered his entourage to proceed towards Medina without delaying further .In this episode we also learn about the mindset of an Islamic fundamentalist .Abd Allah ibn Ubayy 's son .Abd Allah ibn Abd Allah ibn Ubayy was such a fundamentalist .Ibn Sa'd writes : .Abd Allah ibn Abd Allah ibn Ubayy went forward and waited for his father on the way .When he saw him , he made him sit down and said : \" I shall not let you go unless you realize that you have been humbled and Muhammad is honorable . \"Ibn Sa'd vol.ii , p.79 .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"54.41865"}

Muslim women claim to wear the headscarf , or other voluminous covering , out of modesty .I suspect that , in fact , the veil is attractive to women because it subtly appeals to their vanity .Islam tells women that , no matter how plain , old or ill - favoured she is , the sight of her uncovered hair will be so stimulating , that any man who sees it will lose control of his passions .Thus , beneath her modest covering , a Muslim woman can imagine herself the most desirable creature possible .Women who operate freely in society , conversing with men on a daily basis , are , in the end , forced to form a just assessment of their desirability .Unless she is particularly young and pretty , a woman will be made aware of most men 's indifference to her charms .She will find , in the long run , that likeable men will like her as much for her character , skills and wit , as for her beauty .It is when woman 's sexuality is not shrouded that it ceases to be an object of mystery and passion to men , and women have the greatest chance of being treated as more than sexual objects .The headscarf and restrictions that Muslim women adopt lead to the strangest pantomimes when a man approaches .Coverings that have been laid aside among other women have to be hastily donned , emphasizing , rather than reducing , the sexualisation of male - female relations .But in order for women to operate as equal in the public sphere , it has to be assumed that the bulk of interactions between men and women are non - sexual .Muslim women are wrong if they think that the headscarf prevents them from being treated as sex objects .In fact it confirms that that is their social status . \"\" The burqa stripped bare \" from \" The Age \" 18thJanuary , 2004 , written by Karen Green .( Karen Green lectures in philosophy and feminism at Monash University ) .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"69.407135"}
