Chris Christie was a once man wrecking crew and laid waste to the new found darling establishment candidate , Sen. Marco Rubio .Christie lambasted Rubio on being ill prepared to be president of the United States .Christie stated that being a Senator does not prepare one to be president , whereas when one is a governor , they need to make decisions that impact the people who elected them and are held accountable for those decisions .\" Fool me once , shame on you .Fool me twice , shame on me , \" Christie had said ( bettering his former benefactor , George ) .Rubio 's comeback was pretty good , if a little obvious in its intent : He argued that experience was overrated ; if it mattered , Vice President Joe Biden would be a good candidate for commander - in - chief .He then argued that an unspoken premise of the criticism - that Obama has failed in part due to his inexperience - is faulty .Obama knows exactly what he 's doing , Rubio said .The president is not a fool ; he 's a menace .Christie was n't having it , dismissing Rubio 's Biden straw man and recommitting to his initial attack .Rubio 's a nice guy , a smart guy , Christie said ; but the simple fact is that he 's never had to make an important decision .This got a noticeable round of applause from the audience .And perhaps that 's why Rubio then proceeded to self - destruct .Christie stated with regards to Rubio , \" you have not been involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable , you just simply have n't .\" Christie followed up with , \" the fact is , when you talk about the Hezbollah sanctions act that you list as one of your accomplishments , you were n't even there to vote for it . \" Then Christie crushed Rubio with the fact that he did n't even show to vote with ... \" that 's not leadership , that 's truancy \" .Christie then did the most damning thing he could do to Rubio , compared the Florida senator to the 1st term 2008 Sen. Barack Obama and his lack of experience for the job and what that has gotten us .Christie provided the following backhanded compliment , \" I like Marco Rubio and he 's a smart person and a good guy .But he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions .We have watched it happen everybody for the last 7 years .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"80.849304"}

Ted Cruz has been declared the winner in Iowa ! ! !ABC News is calling the race as well .Ted Cruz is the winner of the Iowa Republican caucuses , Fox News projects , beating front - runner Donald Trump in a victory that could shake up the primary race .Trump finishes second , and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio finishes a close third .Supporters of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas delivered a hard - fought upset win over businessman Donald Trump in the Iowa Republican caucuses Monday night , making good on his bet that a methodical campaign organization would eclipse the New Yorker 's media dominance in the first test of GOP voters .With 99 percent of the precincts reporting , Cruz was besting Trump by more than 5,100 votes , with fellow senator Marco Rubio of Florida a close third .Cruz appeared to capitalize on deep support from religious and social conservatives and showed that old - fashioned retail politicking could overcome Trump 's massive political rallies in the Hawkeye state .The final Des Moines Register poll is in ahead of today 's Iowa Caucus , and it shows that Donald Trump has the support of 28 % of likely caucus goers , with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 23 % and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 15 % .The poll was taken beginning the day after Trump announced he would skip last week 's GOP debate .Who knows whether that decision will come back to haunt him or not .We shall also see where the polls back up caucus goers .On the Democratic side , the survey finds former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with 45 % support to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ' 42 % .It is unbelievable that Sanders is so close in the polls to Hillary .Many are looking to gleam and info or data that will give us an indicator as to who might win in Iowa .In the final poll before the Iowa caucuses Monday , Donald Trump holds a slight 5-point lead over Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are neck - and - neck within the margin of error .The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics pool took place January 26 - 29 , three days before Trump skipped the GOP Iowa debate to one day after .This particular poll , which has a history of accuracy as it predicted Rick Santorum 's late surge in 2012 , shows Donald Trump as the frontrunner , but still a close race with two days to go .Trump will need the help of first - time caucus - goers to boost his chances of beating Cruz and in this poll , 40 percent say their caucusing for their first time .Trump does have weaknesses , though , in the eyes of Iowa voters who do n't like his position on eminent domain and past statements in favor of abortion rights .Cruz 's campaign has been running an ad in Iowa showing Trump in 1999 telling a reporter : \" I am very pro - choice . \"","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"89.82384"}
