{"text":"Never confuse the actions of a black individual ( or a group of black individuals ) that mistreats someone white as proof that black racism exists .Their \" power \" is limited ONLY to what they can do as individuals .There are NO black institutions or systems that support , defend , or finance the right of blacks to mistreat whites .There are NO black institutions that are more powerful than white institutions .Therefore , blacks do not have the COLLECTIVE POWER to diminish the quality of life for the white collective .Q : What is collective power ?A : Collective power is the institutions and systems that benefit one group at the expense of another group , and allow one group to dominate another group in all areas of human activity .That is white collective power .It is rare for a white police officer to be punished for using excessive force against a black man , woman , or child .It is just as rare for a black police officer to use excessive force against a white person .In fact , the authors were unable to find a single instance of a black police officer shooting or killing an unarmed white person in the history of modern law enforcement .This is not surprising but it is absolute proof that the black individual operating within a system of white supremacy can not mistreat whites even if he or she is wearing a uniform , a badge , and carrying a gun .Another example of white collective power is the mortgage and real estate industry , which systematically discriminates against black ( and non - white ) renters , homebuyers , and homeowners by : .( gentrification ) .Banks , real estate brokers , appraisers , and mortgage lenders represent INSTITUTIONAL RACISM ( power ) that is reinforced by the courts , banking , and government ( systems ) .This does not mean blacks are less likely to abuse power than whites if given the opportunity .It means blacks can not abuse power that does not exist .The proof : there is no place in America where blacks are collectively practicing racism against whites collectively .Q : Do n't black politicians and corporate executives represent black power ?A : Not necessarily .Having a powerful position does not make a person powerful .For example , shortly after a female employee sued the XYZ firm for sex discrimination , Ms. X and Mrs. Y are appointed to the corporate board .They will be used as proof in the upcoming trial that the XYZ firm does not discriminate against women .Like most token board members , Ms. X and Mrs. Y are benchwarmers ; not policy makers .Their \" powerful \" positions are an ILLUSION designed to deceive the public and the courts .The black man or woman in a ( public ) position of power often serves the same purpose : to give the appearance that certain companies do not discriminate .These blacks maybe qualified for their position ; however , even the \" powerful \" black person - regardless of title -- is still controlled by more powerful whites who limit whatever authority or power this black individual possesses .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"55.905983"}

{"text":"When the African - American community can move beyond the imprisoning walls of homophobia it is freed to explore a larger definition of what it means to be a man or a woman .Roles can no longer be exiguous based only upon gender as people are pushed to seek meaning for themselves instead of depending on the heterosexist script to establish meaning for them .Potential as expressed through vision becomes just as important as tradition .Power systems shift .Sex and sexuality are revisioned as the human body comes to be seen in the light of play and pleasure as well as work that avows its presence as a multidimensional tool for affirmation .A new sexual politic is born .Men can no longer define themselves in the singular context of penetrative sex , but with the whole body as a point of affection and affirmation .The penis does not always have to be the point through which affection has to be expressed .In a new sexual politic women are given greater options in exploring who they are beyond the single role of mother .So many women make the mistake of assuming that womanhood and motherhood / wife are necessarily synonymous .Women are women whether or not they are mothers or somebody 's wife .The ability to bond deeply with people of the same gender ( which does not necessarily imply sexual activity ) collapses the cultural absolutes of nurturing being a female function limited to her \" man \" or children in the domestic sphere .Male nurture collapses the cultural expectations of competition with other males for dominance in their relationships as the quality of emotional needs are given greater focus .Emotional nurture and its resultant bonding is a threat to established heterosexist notions of relationship .The nuclear family transforms into the extended family system where members are grafted in based upon spiritual , physical , and emotional needs as well as blood ties .the nature of the community is transformed as the truth of our gay and lesbian lives is acknowledged on its many levels .We are not a scourge on the African - American community .We are not pawns sent in by that mythical anonymous being \" the white man \" to destroy \" family values \" within our home communities .We simply bear witness to another truth in redefining what it means to be parents , friends and lovers .When the African - American community comes to the expanded consciousness that gays and lesbians are not the enemy , then our \" other - sexual \" truth may possibly set us all free .BIBLIOGRAPHY .Dixon , Melvin .\" I 'll Be Somewhere Listening For My Name .\" Sojourner : Black Gay Voices in the Age of AIDS .Ed .

{"text":"There are many ways to expose the mercurial nature of racial classification .Such episodes serve to unmask the instability of racial systems , yet simply marshaling evidence to prove taxonomies fickle tells only a partial story .In an effort to tell a fuller story about the workings of \" race\"-by which I mean principally the endeavors of racial categorization and stratification - I focus here on historical actors who crossed geographical boundaries and lived their lives within different racial systems .A vision that accounts for the experiences of sojourners and migrants illuminates the ways in which racial classification shifts across borders and thus deepens arguments about racial construction and malleability .At the same time , however , the principal argument of this essay moves in a different direction .We tend to think of the fluid and the mutable as less powerful than the rigid and the immutable , thereby equating the exposure of unstable racial categories with an assault on the very construct of race itself .In a pioneering essay in which Barbara J. Fields took a historical analysis of the concept of race as her starting point , she contended that ideologies of race are continually created and verified in daily life .Hilary McD. Beckles affirms that \" the analysis of ' real experience ' and the theorising of ' constructed representation ' constitute part of the same intellectual project .\" Drawing together these theoretical strands , I argue that the scrutiny of day - to - day lives demonstrates not only the mutability of race but also , and with equal force , the abiding power of race in local settings .Neither malleability nor instability , then , necessarily diminishes the potency of race to circumscribe people 's daily lives ... .Thomas E. Skidmore , Carlos Manuel de Céspedes Professor of History Emeritus Brown University .For me , as a historian of Brazil , North America 's \" one - drop rule \" has always seemed odd .No other society in this hemisphere has defined its racial types in such absolutist terms .David Hollinger , like many American historians before him , is clearly intrigued by this apparently unique \" approach to the question of ethnoracial mixture .\" How can we account for it ?How could such a different racial classification have arisen in North America and not in any of the many other European colonial experiments in the New World ?Hollinger cites three features that in combination allegedly made U.S. racial evolution different .The first is a regime that tolerated slavery and thereby produced a significant population of slave descent .The second is massive immigration that enriched American society .The third is survival of an Indian population , even if only in token numbers .But Hollinger examines the influence of these three factors on racial attitudes and behavior in the United States alone .If we add one other country , Brazil , to the picture , we find something rather startling .All three of Hollinger 's conditions also obtained in Brazil .Yet they did not produce the one - drop rule .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"58.723694"}

{"text":"Alrighty then .Since my disagreements with O'Reilly a few years ago , I 've refused to appear on the Fox News network .I did two appearances on Fox Business , but only because I have modest respect for John Stossel and wanted to discuss the exploitation of college athletes .Beyond that , I 've turned down every appearance request I 've received since that time .I also cringe whenever I see Black commentators being forced to cater to one of the most racist media outlets in American history , only because they have money and an audience .I personally believe that we give credibility to the beast by feeding it with our attention .The truth is that we risk looking weak and desperate when we allow bigoted Whites to put us in situations that they themselves would never accept .Allowing racists to put us on the defensive is one symptom of our continued second - class citizenship .With that said , Bill O'Reilly exists in America for a reason , the same way certain bacteria can only survive in a moldy refrigerator .He thrives in American media because O'Reilly is a living manifestation of every angry , uneducated racist in our country .He connects to the misguided White man the way Beyonce relates to 31-year old Black women .There are a lot of angry , ignorant , arrogant Americans in this country , and those are the people who tune into Fox News .O'Reilly is not only an enemy of progress who seeks to destroy the country he claims to love , he also fails to understand that it is White men like himself who create the things that he and other White men seem to fear .O'Reilly cheered the death of Trayvon Martin because for him , most urban Black males are dastardly , frightening beasts , unworthy of the decency that one would give a fellow human being .Few intelligent people would disagree with the statistics that O'Reilly spews about the struggles of the Black community : Violence is out of control , too many of our families are broken down , we are filling up the penitentiaries , and our economic hurdles are monumental .But where O'Reilly gets off the bus is when the words \" personal responsibility \" come into the mix .You see , White men like O'Reilly are the ones who push to supply guns onto the Black market that young Black teenagers use to kill each other .If they were giving these guns to White kids with no jobs or education , they 'd be killing each other too .It 's hard to hold families together when you 're giving fathers and mothers 100 year prison sentences for crimes that White college students commit every single day of the week .White men like O'Reilly are the ones who profited from the 400-year legacy of slavery and Jim Crow , which created the vast economic disparities built from Whites systematically stealing nearly every penny of wealth from Black families over the course of several hundred years .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"61.063797"}

'It would be difficult to conceive of a more explicit affirmation of the sexualized nature of such attacks as this one .By their words and deeds , the perpetrators expressed a desire at once to annihilate and consume their victim , demanding that she metaphorically , if not literally , assume whatever posture they might devise to revitalize their waning sense of mastery .Then a man , I suppose a Confederate soldier , as he had crutches , fell upon me and ravished me .The klans also administered comparable punishments to women and children of both sexes .In one such episode , nightriders set upon a group of freedpeople , forcing the women to \" lie down , and they jabbed them with sticks , and made them show their nakedness .\" Neither did they spare the children present .Klan members instead descended upon them , \" jabbed them with a stick , and went to playing with their backsides with a piece of fishing - pole . \"( The klansmen were sticking a fishing - pole into the rectum of the innocent children . )Other assaults were still more severe .The son of a former Alabama slave spoke of a klansman , John Lyons , who \" would cut off a woman 's breast \" with little compunction .With the segregation of black into Jim Crow neighborhoods , white sexual assaults did not abate .\" Williams went to the heart of the matter .Echoing the sentiments of ( Ida B. ) Wells , Williams went on to tell the group that the onus of sexual immorality did not rest on black women but on the white men who continued to harass them .While many white women in the audience were fantasizing about black rapists , she implied , black women were actually suffering at the hands of white ones .If white women were so concerned about morality , then they ought to take measures to help protect black women .I do not want to disturb the serenity of this conference by suggesting why this protection is needed and the kind of man against whom it is needed , \" Williams threatened .By implying that white men were the real culprits , Williams attacked not only the myth of black promiscuity , but the notion that women themselves were wholly responsible for their own victimization .Even for black women in Williams 's position the issue was n't an abstract one .Sexual exploitation was so rampant that it compelled thousands of black women to leave the South , or to urge their daughters to do so .Black women , like black men , could expect no justice in a court of law , nor could they look to authorties for protection .For example , when Patience Thompson took her case against Thomas Goss , a white man , to court for beating her after she refused to sell him soap , the court forced her to pay court costs and told her to \" make up \" with him .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"61.712746"}

{"text":"Consequently , many young males get no role model in the classroom .I think the problem is not one of color .That may be rather sexist , but it is the truth .Competency alone is not getting the job done with 50 % of the population in schools .Notice the graduation rates from high school and college is now higher among females than males ?I am not proposing going back to the way it was , if that can even be done , Women have been oppressed too long .Even today it is found a woman makes less than a man for the same work , but education suffers when models and professional athletes make outlandish salaries and teachers make \" peanuts \" .Expanding the premise of this discussion to Pan - Africanism , ours is a unique perspective that can not be shared or served by those who have not experienced and therefore can not empathize with the marginalization if not outright oppression of the African diaspora .Children who see caring , mentoring adults that look , think , and even talk like them relate to and feel like they can be that adult , too .But this is only one factor to consider .Another is to evaluate the sensitivities of these adults by screening for those who can not empathize , regardless of color .I think this is an important initiative .Children generally aspire to be like the role models that they perceive as similar to them .If all the young black males growing up in our educational system are exposed to primarily white female teachers , they are far less likely to make that connection that will spur them onto a career in teaching .It is not racist nor sexist to encourage more diversity in a field with such an impact on our country 's youth .Although , it can sound racist , to some , it is a great idea for the following reason : .There are not enough tangible black mentors or role models to start .We saw and continue to see an improvement in young black childrens ' confidence and grade level just because we have our first black first family in the Whitehouse .But again , Pres .Obama & family are n't easily accessible .And being able to see tv shows and commercials with successful African Americans are n't enough .We need more black mentors and role models that children can see in the flesh and speak to directly .Not only will it be beneficial to black children but also to non - blacks by providing them examples of successful , competent , intellegent black mentors and role models .I believe Arnie Duncan is on the right track , and hope to see him bring this to fruition sooner than later where possible .As a retired high school teacher from a predominantly African American district , I found that the missing ingredient in the success of my black male students was the lack of a positive role model in their lives .Yes I think Duncan is on the right track ; but each candidate , no matter the ethnic background , must be carefully screened for the necessary qualities to be solid classroom teachers and role models .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"61.7811"}

{"text":"The disintegration of the black family began to accelerate during the 1960s .It is one of the great tragedies of modern America that the disintegration of the African - American family has shown no signs of abating .23 Seventy - two percent of African - American children are born out of wedlock .24 It is now commonly recognized that children born out of wedlock are far more likely to experience a host of negative outcomes than are children raised by their own biological , married parents .Married men are more likely to be employed and to have higher earnings than unmarried men , although the relationship between marriage and economic success is complex .However , it is obvious that men who are unemployed or are incarcerated are far less appealing prospective spouses than men who hold down a steady job .26 Yet there are fewer and fewer jobs available - and at lower wages - for men in traditionally masculine industries .27 Giving amnesty to illegal immigrants would only exacerbate this problem facing low - skilled men , who are disproportionately African - American .The dearth of job opportunities gives these men less confidence in their ability to support a family , and gives women reason to fear that these prospective husbands will be only another mouth to feed .Granting amnesty to illegal immigrants will only further harm African - American workers .Not only will the low - skilled labor market continue to experience a surplus of workers , making it difficult for African - Americans to find job opportunities , but African - Americans will be deprived of one of their few advantages in this market .Some states require private employers to use E - Verify to establish that their workers are in the country legally .This levels the playing field a bit for African - Americans .If illegal immigrants are granted legal status , this small advantage disappears .Furthermore , recent history shows that granting amnesty to illegal immigrants will encourage more people to come to the United States illegally .The 1986 amnesty did not solve the illegal immigration problem .To the contrary , that amnesty established the precedent that if you come to America illegally , eventually you will obtain legal status .Thus , it is likely that if illegal immigrants are granted legal status , more people will come to America illegally and will further crowd African - American men ( and other low - skilled men and women ) out of the workforce .Before the federal government decides to grant legal status to illegal immigrants , due deliberation should be given to what effect such grant will have on the employment and earnings prospects of low - skill Americans generally and black Americans specifically .We respectfully submit that granting such legal status is not without substantial costs to American workers .Sincerely , Abigail Thernstrom Vice Chair Gail Heriot Commissioner Peter Kirsanow Commissioner .Illegal immigration to the United States in recent decades has tended to depress both wages and employment rates for low - skilled American citizens , a disproportionate number of whom are black men .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"62.05217"}

'Reward or punish the individual on his merits as an individual .Evil will surely come in the end to both races if we substitute for this just rule the habit of treating all the members of the race , good and bad , alike .The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bands of civilization ; that the spirit of lynching inevitably throws into prominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell therein .No man can take part in the torture of a human being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered .Every lynching means just so much moral deterioration in all the children who have any knowledge of it , and therefore just so much additional trouble for the next generation of Americans .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"63.95547"}

{"text":"My original question to Ally in the other thread was how many of the total figure for male assaults were asynchronous and unprovoked and how many were n't .My original point being that unless we can separate those out , we are potentially merging victim and perpetrator and \" line of duty \" figures and drawing misleading conclusions about relative risk .I do n't think that is disingenuous , I think that is seeking clarity in the data so that a true comparison can be made .Although I accept Ally 's point that it is not always easy to tease out those differences as violence is rarely asynchronous for either men or women ( allegedly ) .Though I think even if that is the case then there are other points to be made about men and women 's relative ability to inflict injury and their relative exposure to risk .\" So it 's not victim blaming if the victim was breaking the law by , say , smoking weed or drinking underage ?Since when has the definition of victim blaming excluded situations where the victim was breaking the law ? \" Are you talking about sexual violence here ?Blame is only appropriate if the victim has contributed to the crime .In the case of sexual violence , how is this possible ?What are the circumstances whereby a person can contribute to somebody having sex with them when they do n't want them to ?It seems to me to be a paradox to invite coercion .Whereas it is not a logical fallacy that you can provoke or invite violence . 1 ) If a person has sex with another person non - consensually , then the crime committed is the unconsensual sex .The victim has not contributed to the crime and therefore blame is inappropriate . 2 ) If two gangs get into a violent confrontation and one assaults the other ( or more successfully assaults the other ) then the crime committed is assault .It still does n't negate the crime , there is still a victim , but the victim contributed to the crime and some blame is appropriate , in that particular case .That 's not to say that he could n't be a blameless victim in a different scenario .What I was trying to convey was the difference between likelihood , risk and susceptibility .Yes men may be twice as likely to be murdered as women , but that does n't mean , ( as I feel was implied ) that they are twice as susceptible to murder or twice at risk of it .For instance , if that figure includes murders sustained in the line of duty , and more men than women are in front line positions , then the higher figure is attached to the activity not the individual or their gender as such .Swimmers are 100 % likely to get wet , runners maybe 20 % , it does n't mean swimmers are more susceptible to water .Again this is an attempt to get some clarity around the data .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"64.9372"}

{"text":"In 2008 , the Commission held a briefing regarding the impact of illegal immigration on the wages and employment opportunities of African - Americans . 1 The testimony at the briefing indicated that illegal immigration disproportionately impacts the wages and employment opportunities of African - American men .The briefing witnesses , well - regarded scholars from leading universities and independent groups , were ideologically diverse .All the witnesses acknowledged that illegal immigration has a negative impact on black employment , both in terms of employment opportunities and wages .The witnesses differed on the extent of that impact , but every witness agreed that illegal immigration has a discernible negative effect on black employment .For example , Professor Gordon Hanson 's research showed that \" Immigration . . .accounts for about 40 percent of the 18 percentage point decline [ from 1960 - 2000 ] in black employment rates . \" 4 Professor Gerald Jaynes 's research found that illegal immigrants had displaced U.S. citizens in industries that had traditionally employed large numbers of African - Americans , such as meatpacking .Illegal immigration has a disparate impact on African - American men because these men are disproportionately represented in the low - skilled labor force .The Census Bureau released a new report on educational attainment after the Commission issued its report .This report , released in February 2012 , found that 50.9 percent of native - born blacks had not continued their education beyond high school .6 The same report found that 75.5 percent of foreign - born Hispanics had not been educated beyond high school , although it does not disaggregate foreign - born Hispanics who are legal immigrants from those who are illegal immigrants . 7However , Professor Briggs estimated that illegal immigrants or former illegal immigrants who received amnesty constitute a third to over a half of the total foreign - born population . 8 Foreign - born Hispanics who are in the United States illegally are disproportionately male .9 African - Americans who have not pursued education beyond high school are also disproportionately male .10 These poor educational attainment levels usually relegate both African - American men and illegal immigrant men to the same low - skilled labor market , where they must compete against each other for work .The obvious question is whether there are sufficient jobs in the low - skilled labor market for both African - Americans and illegal immigrants .The answer is no .As Professor Briggs noted in his testimony to the Commission , \" In February 2008 . . .the national unemployment rate was 4.8 percent , but the unemployment rate for adults ( over 25 years old ) without a high school diploma was 7.3 percent . \"12 During 2007 , \" Black American adult workers without a high school diploma had an unemployment rate of 12.0 percent , and those with only a high school diploma had an unemployment rate of 7.3 percent . \"13 These statistics suggest both that there is an overall surplus of workers in the low - skilled labor market , and that African - Americans are particularly disfavored by employers .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"66.404816"}

{"text":"The same type of education / age comparison used to measure the wage impact shows that a 10 percent increase in the size of a skill group reduced the fraction of native - born blacks in that group holding a job by 5.1 percentage points .Furthermore , these statistics reflect an economy that was not experiencing the persistent stagnation we are experiencing today .The country 's economic woes have disproportionately harmed African - Americans , especially those with little education .In 2011 , 24.6 percent of African - Americans without a high school diploma were unemployed , as were 15.5 percent of African - Americans with only a high school diploma .16 Two and half years into the economic recovery , African - Americans face particular difficulty obtaining employment .According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the seasonally adjusted January 2013 unemployment rate for all black Americans - not just those with few skills - was 13.8 percent , nearly twice the white unemployment rate of 7.0 percent .17 The economy has a glut of low - skilled workers , not a shortage .Not only do illegal immigrants compete for jobs with African - Americans , but that competition drives down wages for the jobs that are available .Harvard professor George Borjas writes : . 'Illegal immigration reduces the wages of native workers by an estimated $ 99 to $ 118 billion a year . . . .A theory - based framework predicts that the immigrants who entered the country from 1990 to 2010 reduced the average annual earnings of American workers by $ 1,396 in the short run .Because immigration ( legal and illegal ) increased the supply of workers unevenly , the impact varies across skill groups , with high school dropouts being the most negatively affected group .Immigration , both legal and illegal , resulted in a disproportionately large increase in the number of high school dropouts in the labor pool .This caused a drop in wages among the poorest and least - educated members of the workforce .19 As discussed above , these people are disproportionately likely to be African - American men .Furthermore , there is evidence that wages for these men have not just failed to increase as much as they would have in the absence of illegal immigration .Their real wages , the number of dollars they take home at the end of the week , have actually diminished .20 A $ 960 annual decrease may not seem like much to a lawyer or a doctor .The consequences of illegal immigration for black men and the black community in general are not limited to wages .In another study , Borjas found that lower wages and fewer jobs also correlate with an increase in the black incarceration rate .Among white men , the same 10 % increase in supply reduces the wage by 3.2 % , but has much weaker employment and incarceration effects : a 2.1 percentage - point reduction in the employment rate and a 0.2 percentage - point increase in the incarceration rate .It seems , therefore , that black employment and incarceration rates are more sensitive to immigration rates than those of whites .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"68.33372"}

{"text":"I was speaking in general .One argument I think you can successfully make is that if rape is a special crime subject to special rules then false rape can and should also be considered a special crime subject to special rules .That might be an avenue worth exploring .\" I do n't believe there should be parity sentencing as some are calling for \" .That depends on what you call parity sentencing .If a person has spent 10 years in prison falsely accused of rape and it comes to light that the accusation is false and it is proven to be so , the accused should spend at least 12 years in prison like 20 years with possible parole after 13 .Have them make the case that they are no longer a threat to society .I do n't see why people have a problem placing the onus on the false accuser to prove that they are n't a threat to society .They should be placed on something similar to a sex offender 's registry .If the false accusation comes to light before anyone is charged or prosecuted or their identities are released , then I think perjury guidelines are probably warranted , but at the higher end as rape is a special crime .She should be charged and made an example of .There are a significant portion of rape and domestic violence claims that are false because women can get away with it and use it as revenge .This hurts women who are real victims and hurts the innocent men who 's only crime was trusting someone .It 's unclear how many claims actually are for \" revenge .\" I suspect the greater number of false accusations are actually due to \" regret \" and the shame that someone will feel once their consensual sexual behavior comes to light .This is a much more complicated mess because our society is so completely paranoid about sex , and the fear of being shamed is a fairly strong motivation for women denying their own sexual agency .The same standard should apply : Presumption of innocence , benefit of the doubt .But if she was a minor when she committed the crime or if the statute of limitations has expired then no , she should be presumed innocent .Sadly even when the above requirements are met false accusers are highly likely to get away with it , and the same standards are not held to for all rape accusations .The facebook message was what kicked it all off .After having been friended by his accuser , Banks and a private investigator met with her and have a recording in which she states that Banks did not rape her .It was on the basis of this statement that his sentence was vacated .In a later interview with prosecutors , she refused to admit to the false allegation .Well there you 've got the system actually working as it 's meant to ( well assuming what you all are saying about this is accurate ) .You require more evidence to convict someone than to exonerate them .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"71.447044"}

{"text":"Being selective about Malcolm 's life and only focusing on his \" post - Hajj \" years is to overlook Malcolm 's complexities and how his life journey carries such a meaningful message about self - criticism , among other things .He was committed to learning and , unlike the political \" leaders \" in the world today , was not afraid to admit his mistakes .There are still things we need to be critical of , however .Similar to how bell hooks critiqued Frantz Fanon , Paulo Freire , and Aime Cesaire on their male - centered language , the same needs to be said about Malcolm X. Writing only about male experiences with oppression perpetuates sexism , as it ignores and erases the experiences of women .As Michael Eric Dyson writes , \" Such a strategy not only borrows ideological capital from the white patriarchy that has historically demeaned black America , but blunts awareness of how the practice of patriarchy of black men has created another class of victims within black communities .\" I remember when I took an entire class on Malcolm X , the professor , an African - American woman , critiqued Malcolm 's sexist logic throughout the semester and reminded us that much of Malcolm 's legacy has been shaped and defined by men .Malcolm was a strong advocate of women 's education , but many of his attitudes towards women were also restrictive and rooted in distrust .My professor also spoke a lot about the women who played a significant role in Malcolm 's life , including his wife Betty Shabazz and his mother and sisters who taught him \" the importance of race pride and self identity .\" I do find Malcolm 's sexist logic to be in line with traditional patriarchal attitudes that we can find in all communities .In his autobiography , Malcolm explains that Islam teaches true Love because the beauty of the person is found within , not on the outside .I believe this is true , but the stereotypical gender roles were also present in Malcolm 's interpretation .As a young Muslim man , I saw Malcolm 's leadership , politics , and courage as an example that was exclusive to men .I viewed Prophet Muhammad , peace be upon him , in a similar way .That is , men alone needed to be leaders and role models , whereas women were \" followers \" and \" looked up to us . \"Critiques about masculinity and sexism in Malcolm 's life are important ; they have been and are addressed by black feminists and activists .In other narratives , a lot of non - black Muslims try to isolate Malcolm as a Muslim and only a Muslim while ignoring African - American struggle .Through this process , Malcolm 's racial identity gets erased and he becomes an appropriated icon - this appropriation , under the assumption that all marginalized communities \" share \" the \" same \" oppression , only contributes to anti - black racism .Although I am not African - American , Malcolm 's speeches about not being ashamed of your skin color or where you come from resonated with me very strongly at a young age .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"74.81913"}

{"text":"During the Jim Crow era , women 's bodies served as signposts of the social order , and white men used rape and rumors of rape not only to justify violence against black men but to remind black women that their bodies were not their own .African American women frequently retaliated by testifying about their brutal experiences .I argue that , from Harriet Jacobs to Ida B. Wells to the women of the present , the refusal of black women to remain silent about sexualized violence was part of a long - standing tradition .Black women described and denounced their sexual misuse , deploying their voices as weapons in the wars against white supremacy .Indeed , their public protests often galvanized local , national , and even international outrage and sparked campaigns for racial justice and human dignity .When Betty Jean Owens spoke out against her assailants , and when the local black community mobilized in defense of her womanhood in 1959 , they joined in this tradition of testimony and protest .The arrest , trial , and conviction of Owens 's white rapists by an all - white jury marked a dramatic change in the relations between this tradition of testimony and a tradition of silence that Darlene Clark Hine has termed the \" culture of dissem - blance . \" 4 The verdict not only broke with southern tradition but fractured the philosophical and political foundations of white supremacy by challenging the relationship between sexual domination and racial inequality .For perhaps the first time since Reconstruction , southern black communities could imagine state power being deployed in defense of their respectability as men and women .As a result , the 1959 Tallahassee rape case was a watershed event that remains as revealing now as it was important then .The sexual exploitation of black women had its roots in slavery .Slave owners , overseers , and drivers took advantage of their positions of power and authority to rape slave women , sometimes in the presence of their husbands or families .White slave owners ' stolen access to black women 's bodies strengthened their political , social , and economic power , partly because colonial laws made the offspring of slave women the property of their masters .5 After the fall of slavery , when African Americans asserted their freedom during the interracial experiment in democracy that briefly characterized Reconstruction , former slaveholders and their sympathizers used violence and terror to reassert control over the social , political , and economic agency of freedpeople .At the heart of this violence , according to Gerda Lerner , rape became a \" weapon of terror \" to dominate the bodies and minds of African American men and women .\" Freedom , \" as Tera Hunter notes , \" was meaningless without ownership and control over one 's own body . \"During Reconstruction and Jim Crow , sexualized violence served as a \" ritualistic reenactment of the daily pattern of social dominance , \" and interracial rape became the battleground upon which black men and women fought for ownership of their own bodies .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"76.96028"}

Blow wrote an op - ed for the New York Times .As the 911 tapes were released and began to raise troubling questions about the shooter 's pursuit of Trayvon and the Sanford Police investigation .These tapes prompted Judd Legume of Think Progress on March 18 to put together a set of simple facts titled \" What Everyone Should Know About Trayvon Martin ( 1995 - 2012 ) \" ; that story quickly went viral , with 147,000 likes on Facebook .The petition topped 200,000 signatures , and it seemed that everyone on social media was talking about the Trayvon Martin case .There 's more to this story of Trayvon , racism and social media , however .There is also an amped up , racist smear campaign that is trying to promote the idea that Trayvon was a \" drug dealer \" who is far more dangerous than the mainstream and left - leaning blogosphere has depicted .While it might be easy to dismiss the people behind sites like WAGIST as right - wing nut jobs ( RWNJ ) , that 's too easy .Dismissing them as fringe also does n't accurately describe what 's happening around Trayvon , racism and social media .The thoroughly mainstream , if right - leaning , Business Insider has made a linkbait - cottage - industry out of news about the Trayvon Martin case , including a photo it reported was of Trayvon in a \" thug \" pose and used it to question the supposed bias in media reporting .Unfortunately , the photo was not of the Trayvon Martin who was killed but of someone else .The source for the Business Insider photo : white power message board Stormfront .And Business Insider was n't the only one .Michelle Malkin , right - wing pundit , also reproduced the photo on her site .The fact that Business Insider and Michelle Malkin are reproducing images from Stormfront illustrates the point I made earlier about the overlap between extremist and more mainstream expressions of white supremacy .The racist smear campaign against Trayvon Martin continues .Today , it 's reported that a white supremacist hacker that goes by the name \" Klanklannon \" has broken into the private Facebook account of Trayvon Martin and published the contents on the message board 4chan - called \" /pol/. \" The messages were posted on four slides , designed to back up the racist argument Trayvon was \" dangerous \" ( and therefore deserved to be killed ) .A slide titled \" Trayvon Martin Used Marijuana Habitually , \" features an exchange between Trayvon and a friend about getting high .Another slide , \" Trayvon Martin was a Drug Dealer , \" features Facebook messages and photos that supposedly prove Martin dealt drugs , including a picture of Martin posing \" aggressively with a large amount of cash in his hand .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"78.72525"}

{"text":"Intermarriage rates are higher for the college educated , despite the fact that the ethnic diversity of college campuses is considerably lower than the ethnic diversity of society as a whole .The gap between the intermarriage percentage that you would expect by random chance if people married others with the same level of education , and what is actually observed , is quite modest among college graduates , but its quite high for high school dropouts .Asian and Latino intermarriage seems to fit the general profile of immigrant assimilation .Second and later generation immigrants assimilate very fully into their communities linguistically and otherwise , and often outmarry .The future of Asian and Latino marriage patterns may follow that of the \" Southern European \" identity , which ceased to be very ethnically distinct in the United States in a way that drives marriage patterns .My intuition is that interracial marriage rates for African immigrant populations ( e.g. recent immigrants from Ethiopia and Kenya ) , are probably more similar to Latino and Asian immigrant populations than to African - American populations .For example , immigrant Africans in Denver 's public housing projects are much more likely to be married than African - Americans in Denver 's public housing projects , and there is probably less discrimination against African immigrants than there is against African - Americans in economic and social contexts .Razib notes that \" The article ignores the elephant in the room : that Americans do not treat African ancestry like they treat Asian ( or Amerindian ) ancestry .Someone with a black American parent may identify as mixed race , but there is a great deal of social pressure and expectation , such that they are de facto viewed as black .\" But , I am not so pessimistic .Anecdotal evidence that I have encountered , at least , suggests that \" one drop \" rule notwithstanding , that mixed race children with a black parent and a white parent are indeed a major bridge between the two groups in social settings .Social Class Implications .This elephant in the room is also shrinking as social class divides based on race and ethnicity fades .Despite the fact that almost every statistic you may see on African - American socio - economic success is discouraging , in the big picture in the medium to long term , the story has been one of remarkable socio - economic progress .The flip side of this optimistic fact , is that social class mobility is probably considerably lower in the United States for Anglos than the overall figures suggest .On the other hand , some of the apparently high social class mobility seen in many European nations may be a product of immigrant assimilation patterns seen in the United States , as most of the developed countries of Europe has experienced considerable immigration in recent times .Immigration in the United States in recent years has been typical of the developed world generally .Perhaps we truly are developing a meritocratic society and perhaps social class divisions based for a couple of generations on real merit are more stable than divisions based on proxies for merit .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"81.36546"}

Ray , Associate Professor of African and Afro- American Studies Brandeis University , Waltham , Massachusetts .In the summer and fall of 1919 , the African - owned Gold Coast press was awash with news stories and impassioned commentary about the postwar race riots that had recently devastated Liverpool , Cardiff , and other major port cities in Britain .Angered by the sexual politics underlying the riots , Gold Coast commentators were quick to point out that the ports ' white rioters were not the only ones aggrieved by interracial sexual relations .In a few short lines , Atu vivified the \" tensions of empire \" created by the movement of African men between metropole and colony , and their different systems of raced and gendered sexual access .Not long after , the Leader published a series of commentaries under the provocative title \" Immoral Sanitation .\" The unnamed author of the series ' first installment declared that unseemly sexual liaisons between African women and European men had transformed the \" social life \" of Sekondi , a busy coastal town in the Gold Coast 's Western Province , into \" a condition of depravity . \" Elsewhere in the colony , \" a woman who boldly acknowledges herself the kept mistress of a European is thrown out of society and virtually looked down upon by men and women of respectability , \" claimed the writer .In Sekondi , however , he accused \" energetic advocates of this dishonourable mode of life \" of enticing young women into sexual relationships with European men , whose \" carnal lust \" was causing the moral deterioration of the town 's womenfolk .The Leader 's lurid tales of illicit relationships between profligate white men and debauched African women during the early twentieth century contrast sharply with historical accounts of respectable marriages between entrepreneurial African women and European men during an earlier time period in coastal West Africa .These unions produced West Africa 's prominent Afro - European trading families and are often credited with successfully integrating European men into local West African societies and empowering African women during the long period of contact preceding the nineteenth - century advent of formal colonial rule .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"81.73468"}

{"text":"Q : I like what your museum does but I wonder if inadvertently you provide ammunition for censorship .There is a local group that wants to ban To Kill A Mockingbird and your museum is their \" evidence . \" -- Vernon Cairnie , New York , NY .A : The Jim Crow Museum does not advocate the banning of any books .Our goal is to use objects of intolerance to teach lessons of tolerance .Even books that are obviously racist , for example , Thomas Dixon 's The Clansmen ( 1905 ) , give us important insight into the racial attitudes and mores that once dominated this culture .Banning books stops conversations , and the goal of the Jim Crow Museum is to facilitate deep , even painful , discussions about race , race relations , racism , and racial healing .To Kill a Mockingbird is not only a literary masterpiece ; it is a perceptive portrayal of the racial hierarchy that existed during the Jim Crow era .This semi - autobiographical novel , written by Harper Lee , is set in the Deep South in the 1930s .The protagonist and narrator of the story is Jean Louise Finch , nicknamed Scout .Her father , Atticus Finch , is an attorney appointed to defend a black man ( Tom Robinson ) falsely accused of raping a white girl .To Kill a Mockingbird was inspired by the case of the Scottsboro Boys , where nine Black boys , ranging in age from 13 to 19 , were falsely accused of sexually assaulting two White girls .The Scottsboro trials , in which the youths were sentenced to death by all - White juries despite the weak and contradictory testimonies of witnesses , represent the nadir of African American experiences with the United States criminal justice system .The death sentences , originally scheduled to be carried out quickly , were postponed and the cases eventually reached the United States Supreme Court , where the sentences were overturned .One of the women later denied being raped ; nevertheless , the retrials resulted in convictions .All of the defendants were eventually acquitted , paroled , pardoned , or escaped , some after serving years in prison .The Scottsboro case sent this message to Black American men : regardless of the evidence , if a White woman said that you raped her you were guilty , and you would be lynched by a mob or legally lynched by a corrupt criminal justice system .A Black man accused of raping a White woman in the 1930s was likely to be lynched .The lynching of Blacks was relatively common between Reconstruction and World War II .According to Tuskegee Institute data , between the years 1882 and 1951 , 4,730 people were lynched in the United States : 3,437 Black and 1,293 White .Many of the White lynching victims were foreigners or belonged to oppressed groups , for example , Mormons , Shakers , and Catholics .By the early 1900s lynching had a decidedly racial character , that is , White mobs lynched Blacks .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"87.45328"}

May Walker to call members of the grand jury into special session in Tallahassee on May 6 , 1959 .Over two hundred black spectators , mostly students , squeezed into the segregated balcony at the Leon County Courthouse to catch a glimpse of Betty Jean Owens and her attackers before they retreated into the secret hearing .Still undergoing hospital treatment for injuries inflicted during the attack and for \" severe depression , \" Owens was accompanied to the courthouse by a nurse , the hospital administrator , and her mother .Gasps and moans emanated from the balcony when , after two hours behind closed doors , William Collinsworth , David Beagles , Patrick Scarborough , and Ollie Stoutamire emerged , calmly faced the judge , and pleaded innocent to the charge of rape , making a jury trial mandatory .African Americans in the balcony roared with disapproval .Dr. M.

Williams , a local black leader , shouted , \" four colored men would be dead if the situation had been reversed .It looks like an open and shut case .\" Defense attorneys for Collinsworth and Scarborough argued for a delay , insisting that public excitement threatened a fair trial , but Judge Walker ignored their objections .For the first time in Florida history , a judge sent the white defendants charged with raping an African American woman back to jail to await their trial .Echoing the sentiments of the people around him , a young boy traced \" we want justice \" in the dust on the railing of the segregated balcony .Justice was the last thing the black community expected .In the thirty - four years since Florida began sending convicted rapists to the electric chair instead of the gallows , the state had electrocuted thirty - seven African Americans charged with raping white women .Before this , Florida led the country in per capita lynchings , even surpassing such notoriously violent states as Mississippi , Georgia , and Louisiana .From 1900 to 1930 , white Floridians lynched 281 people , 256 of whom were African American .Throughout its history , Florida never executed or lynched a white man for raping a black woman .In this respect , Florida followed the entire region .Florida 's violent history included the \" little Scottsboro \" case involving Samuel Shepard , Walter Irvin , and Charles Greenlee , black men accused of raping a white woman in Groveland , Florida , in 1949 .After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned their guilty verdicts in 1951 , Sheriff Willis McCall picked up Shepard and Irvin from Raiford State Prison to transfer them back to the county .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"94.49742"}

{"text":"How the panic over rape was orchestrated TAGS : VIOLENCE , HOME OFFICE , CRIME For years the Home Office and the former Lord Chancellor 's Department have misled the media about rape statistics - and allowed the media to misinform the public .Anxiety has grown as a result of the apparent increase in rape offences and the inability to successfully prosecute offenders .Women have been needlessly alarmed for their safety , when the actual threat is much smaller than has been pretended .Congratulations , therefore , to the Radio 4 programme More or Less and its reporter Ruth Alexander , who have put into the public domain what some advisers engaged by Whitehall committees have known for some time .This official misinformation , one suspects , was a deliberate policy choice ( beginning somewhere around 1988 ) to ensure that no matter what the cost , rape and sex crimes would climb remorselessly up the political agenda .Since 1999 the Home Office has known that its methods for calculating rape convictions are wrong .The real conviction rate is not the publicly broadcast 10 per cent but closer to 50 per cent ( it varies slightly from year to year ) .The attrition rate refers to the number of convictions secured compared with the number of that particular crime reported to the police ( it must be noted that a crime that is ' reported ' does not automatically imply that the crime actually took place ) .The conviction rate refers to the number of convictions secured against the number of persons brought to trial for that given offence .Rape is the only crime judged by the attrition rate .All others - murder , assault , robbery , and so on - are assessed by their conviction rates .Why ?The question is best addressed to Betty Moxon who , in 2000 , was head of the Sex Offenders Review Team ( SORT ) for whom I wrote the minority report .In the most recent edition of More or Less , broadcast last Friday and still available as a podcast , Ruth Alexander questioned why rape has been made an exception .Referring to a new report soon to be published by London Metropolitan University she said it claimed that Britain had the worst record in Europe for rape convictions .Over recent years , she said , the report showed that the conviction rate had fallen from 10 per cent to 6.5 per cent .However DarkSideCat 's explications are not complete , as they are missing to mention legal fees .Legal fees play a highly important part of the US - legal system .It is the most expensive legal system in this world .Women claiming to be raped ( whatever ' rape ' might mean in USA ) will get assistance free of charge , while accused men find their accounts being locked , might find themselves in jail and have seriously problems to defend themselves .If you look through cases of the Innocent Project , you will find men convicted of rape , for a crime they did not commit .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"104.80501"}
