Gabrielle Giffords ' opening remarks before a congressional committee on Wednesday , focused on the racial component of gun control .According to Carolla , the author of \" Not Taco Bell Material , \" the calls for gun control only come when it happens somewhere besides inner - city urban areas .\" Listen , here 's the deal , \" Carolla said .\" It 's nice .It 's not going to do anything , but it 's nice .There 's too many [ guns ] out in circulation .It 's kind of \" people control \" we need to get over .And you know , whenever they do this math by the way - I was listening to the radio today .It happens - when it happens to the white kids or it happens in the theater , then it 's a big deal .But it goes on every day in the inner city , and no one seems to care about it . \"Not talking about gun violence in the inner - city and only raising the issue when it happens in the suburbs has a racial component , Carolla added .\" Over the course statistically , that 's how many dead kids there are , \" Carolla said .\" It 's been going on .It 's still going on .It continues to go on .We do n't seem to have any answers for it or we do n't seem to want to present any answers for it .I do n't know why .There 's a racial component to it .But when all the blacks and Mexicans are dead , ' Shh , do n't say anything .We do n't want to upset them .

Kerry .\" This investment will do what we worked to do in the Affordable Care Act , which is provide more services to more patients , and help provide quality , affordable service day in and day out . \"\" I am happy to see that both the Holyoke Health Center and Community Health Connections , Inc. in Fitchburg received this funding to help increase access to these two vital community health partners , \" said Rep. Olver .\" No one should question the importance of preventative care and we as a nation must continue to invest in community health centers like these , who are on the ground every day making sure everyone has access to the comprehensive healthcare and services they need . \"\" Community health centers are so important to the well being of our neighborhoods because of the services they provide and the programming that they offer , \" said Rep. Capuano .\" These funds will help existing community health centers do even more for their patients by improving existing facilities and expanding services . \"\" For many years , I have been a strong advocate of expanding community health care centers throughout western Massachusetts , \" said Rep. Neal . \" These centers provide families in cities like Springfield and Holyoke crucial access to health care services and preventive care .They also a terrific economic development engine .I believe we should improve and expand access to quality care , and these federal funds will allow our local community health centers to continue to deliver care to thousands of people in the Pioneer Valley . \"\" It can not be disputed that Community Health Centers are a vital part of our health care system , providing services to over 600,000 Massachusetts residents , \" said Rep. Keating .\" The invaluable services this funding would provide including 3 additional examination rooms , a new full - time geriatrician to serve the growing elder population and a new center of primary care for residents of public housing with available shuttle van service .Thanks to the $ 500,000 grant , Manet 's Hull site will be able to serve 1,508 additional patients , totaling over 4,500 patients treated annually .The $ 5 million grant , which continues the expansion of the North Quincy site , will allow 7,000 new patients to be treated , raising the annual total to over 30,000 .These grants will translate into real results and solutions for many residents in our area and I applaud the Obama Administration for awarding Manet these funds . \"","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"101.267265"}
