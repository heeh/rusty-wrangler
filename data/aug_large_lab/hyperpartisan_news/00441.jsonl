Bob Graham of Florida , in anticipation of Kerry 's pick .Just as Kerry announced that the Edwards family would visit Teresa Heinz Kerry 's farm outside Pittsburgh tonight , the campaign distributed by e - mail a revised campaign travel schedule taking that meeting into account .Throughout much of their primary campaign contest for the Democratic Party 's presidential nomination , Kerry derided Edwards ' youth .The North Carolinian is but nine years younger - but has held elective office for only six years compared with Kerry 's three decades , and his youthful appearance and demeanor are in sharp contrast with Kerry 's gray visage .The primary differences notwithstanding , Kerry declared : \" John Edwards is ready for this job . \"Edwards said in a written statement distributed by the campaign : \" I was honored this morning to receive a call from Sen. Kerry asking me to join his ticket .I was humbled by his offer - and thrilled to accept it . \"President Bush , speaking with reporters in the Oval Office during a photo session after he met with the prime minister of Iceland , said that he looked forward \" to a good , spirited contest . \"He also said that Vice President Dick Cheney had called Edwards \" to say that he welcomes him to the race , and as do I. \" .In the e - mail , Kerry said he was proud to select Edwards , praising his optimistic approach to politics and his focus on the pressures facing middle - class workers . \"John reaches across party lines and speaks to the heart of America - hope and optimism , \" he said .With his choice , Kerry apparently overcame the irritation he felt when the men were competing for the nomination .He went so far as to suggest that the one - term senator was not qualified to be president .At another moment , Kerry said he did n't know if Edwards was even \" out of diapers \" when Kerry came back from the Vietnam War .The putative Democratic nominee closely held the selection process and managed to keep his running mate a secret until about 30 minutes before he announced it over e - mail .The Republican National Committee dubbed the North Carolina senator \" a disingenuous , unaccomplished liberal .\"Within minutes of Kerry 's announcement , it had distributed a 30-page report on Edwards ' Senate record and said : \" Edwards professes to be ( a ) Southern moderate , but votes like ( a ) Northeastern liberal .\" Kerry campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill told reporters that Kerry told her and Jim Johnson , who headed the running mate search , of his decision at some point after 10:30 p.m. Monday , at his wife 's farm .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"89.25328"}
