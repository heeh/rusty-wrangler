'Gangnam Style ' is different .The social media response to ' Gangnam Style ' is largely about absurdity , about the surrealism of the song and the video , not really about music for music 's sake . 'Gangnam Style ' has become an event .It 's a piece of shared cultural currency which can be taken as known in a world which is increasingly nicheified .Each one of those things only seems to drive much more attention to the original , which only helps Psy out even more .So , even if it 's not really true that he 's \" waived \" the copyright on the song or video , can anyone honestly argue that copyright has had a significant hand in the Gangnam Style cultural phenomenon ?If anything , it 's the fact that everyone ignores the copyright that has made it such a big deal .A large percentage of those derivative works and videos almost certainly \" infringe \" upon the copyright of both the song and the video .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"74.72739"}

{"text":"Kenny and I are pretty much always laughing together - so apologies for me laughing in the middle of this segment that aired this morning : .It seems like we have a hard time forgetting about the \" I ' ' in Twitter .That was the conclusion by two Rutgers professors who studied the content of 3,000 tweets sent by 350 Twitter users .The communication and information professors , Mor Naaman and Jeffrey Boase , found that there tend to be two types of Twitter folks .The majority , or 80 percent , were what they called \" meformers \" -- Twitter users who sent out messages that revolved around themselves , updating others about their activities or sharing thoughts and feelings .The other 20 percent are \" informers \" -- people who were actually sharing information .Not surprisingly , the informers tended to have larger social networks and be more interactive .In their study , on average , informers had at least twice as many friends and followers compared to meformers .Another interesting note : women tended to be more \" meformers \" than men .Naaman told me he thinks people talk about themselves simply because it 's the easiest thing to do - it 's natural , and it is probably what we all talk about most of the time .He also thinks that as people get more used to these streams , like we had to do with e - mail , or even the telephone , usage will adapt .Naaman himself has even done this - after doing the study , he told me he realized his Twitter account was too much meformer than informer , so he set up a new account .Twitter 's picked up on this , too : Last week , the question ' ' What are you doing ? ' ' was changed to ' ' What 's happening ? ' ' -- an evolution perhaps in how they see people using the site .Because Naaman and Boase think social awareness streams are becoming an important part of the way some people communicate , both through public and personal relationships , they do n't come down that hard on the meformers as you think they would .Although the meformers ' self focus might be characterized by some as self - indulgent , these messages may play an important role in helping others maintain relationships , \" they wrote in their study .I do n't have a problem with meformers , per say - there are plenty of \" meformer\"-focused Tweets can are interesting , funny or help you connect with someone .But as someone who spents a lot of time wading through social awareness streams , some days , I think I 'm drowning in self - indulgence .Naaman also told me that they 've just really started getting into studying this - so we 'll be on the lookout for future findings .In the meantime , always worth remembering : if we are really about wanting to develop relationships on social networking sites , we should limit the screaming or whining about ourselves , start listening and interact .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"93.4415"}

{"text":"There was the story about some conspiracy theory guy claiming his site had been seized by ICE , after being hacked and having infringing works uploaded .That turned out not to be true .And now , there 's a story about the hacking group LulzSecurity made their own website look like it had been seized by ICE .Both of these later stories involved bewildered ICE spokespeople trying to figure out why the press was calling them and insisting that no such domains had been seized at all .But all of this makes me wonder if \" my site 's been seized by ICE \" is becoming a meme , a la the rickroll , in which sites looking for attention suddenly pretend that they were seized by ICE .At best , this seems to suggest that , for all of ICE 's insistence that this program has been a massive success in \" informing \" the public , an awful lot of people associate the ICE seizures with being a total joke , ripe for mocking .It certainly seems to detract from the message that ICE is trying to send .Separately , this does make me wonder if one of these pranks is going to get someone in trouble at some point .It 's pretty silly , but the federal government gets all upset when you use their various logos and seals without permission ... .from the looking - up dept .If you 've been living under a pop - cultural rock the past couple of weeks , you might have missed the \" Pants on the Ground \" meme , birthed on American Idol , that 's been going around .Basically , there was some Idol contestant , \" General \" Larry Platt who performed a song he \" wrote \" himself called \" Pants on the Ground .\" It 's awful in that \" wow , this is going to be an internet meme \" kind of way ... and the Idol crew milked it for all it was worth .Not only are lots of people recording their own versions of it , Platt is appearing everywhere .How ridiculous is this ?The guy just got a ton of publicity and has made his name and his song known around the world .You do n't cash in by going back and demanding cash -- you cash in by doing something new for money .He should n't be hiring a lawyer , but a business manager .If people had to pay for every use of his song originally , no one would even know who he is .Separately , the link above claims that \" Platt never copyrighted the song , \" but that 's not right .Platt automatically gets a copyright on the song once it 's been set in fixed form in some manner .So if he wrote it down somewhere or recorded it or something , he has the copyright .What they probably mean is that he did n't register the copyright , which would limit his ability to do anything about it .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"104.89064"}
{"text":"from the questions,-questions dept .Last week , we wrote about some of the copyright issues around the whole \" Harlem Shake \" meme ( and , yes , we know it 's not the \" real \" Harlem Shake , so do n't even bother commenting about that ) .However , a few days ago , I was talking to an old friend who also happens to be an IP lawyer , and he pointed out one of the nuttier things about our copyright system .Yes , he said , Baauer is making tons of money by monetizing all of those Harlem Shake videos with ads .But Baauer actually had almost nothing to do with the popularity of the song or the meme itself .This is n't a Psy situation , where his video / dance created the meme .Instead , as we discussed , there was this video , which led to this video , and then this video and then this video ... and then tens of thousands of copycats bloomed .In many ways , this reminds me of Derek Sivers ' popular discussion of the importance of the \" First Follower . \"As he notes , it 's the \" first follower who transforms the lone nut into a leader . \"And then you have the \" second follower \" which represents a \" turning point \" in creating a movement .In this case , none of these key aspects had anything to do with Baauer .Yes , the song was there , but there were any number of songs that could have kicked off a similar dance craze .The reason the whole meme happened had to do with those originators , and the first few followers , turning it into a meme .I do n't think any of them are complaining .In fact , they all seem ( quite reasonably ) thrilled that they 're suddenly getting tons of attention and millions of hits ( and plenty of new followers ) for their role in building the meme .But , when we step back and look at the copyright system , it does make you wonder why the system is so focused on Baauer 's ability to get paid , but not the people who actually made the whole meme what it is .In many ways , this is an extreme example of where copyright may be fundamentally flawed .Content becomes popular through cultural sharing .People talk about something amazing and it gets passed along .The \" Harlem Shake \" videos are a form of that , where the importance of everyone in the role of expanding the community and making the song / meme a cultural \" thing \" is that much more clear .Historically , we 've often lumped together the initial creative work with the eventual popularity of it , leaving aside the role of the community in making that work a hit .Now , I 'm a big believer in learning to gain benefits without resorting to copyright , and it seems like the folks who really built this meme are being rewarded in their own ways , outside of the copyright system .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"105.17349"}
{"text":"You 'd be hard pressed to find a single case where it has hurt him .Hell , just imagine a world in which everyone making those response videos would have needed to get permission from Psy or his label .Does anyone think that , under those circumstances , it would be the same sort of cultural phenomenon today ?Obviously , there 's no way it would be anywhere close to as big .For those of you not in the know , \" Fus Ro Dah \" is a phrase spoken by characters in the Bethesda game Skyrim when casting a spell that sends a blast of energy knocking back anything in its path .For those Star Wars buffs out there , it is very similar to a Jedi Force Push .This spell has spawned its very own meme using both in game footage of the spell use and the use of the phrase just before real people fall on video , as can be seen here : .While we are not entirely sure of Zenimax 's true intentions , we do know that due to the ownership culture we have in the US many companies want control over anything related or somewhat related to their properties .This protectionist attitude is probably the primary driver of this move .Zenimax most likely feels that since this meme is based on one of its properties , it should have sole control over its use .Unfortunately , this move to trademark a meme can actually result in its premature death .Memes are born in the wild and are best able to grow and spread if left to the whims and wiles of those on the internet .Memes can not be controlled or tamed .If Zenimax 's trademark filing is approved , the moment it makes its first move toward control , such as sending a cease and desist or taking down a video , it will feel a backlash by fans of Skyrim .If Zenimax had anyone capable of rational thought running its operation , it would have left this meme be and sat back and enjoyed the free advertising it provides for one of its games .from the meme - me dept .Back during the February domain seizures by ICE , before ICE had officially announced which domains had been seized , we saw some stories that named a few of the sites .So we contacted one of the administrators for one of the sites in question , which showed the \" seized \" graphic on it , asking about the guy 's intentions and how he would respond .We got back a really bizarre answer , and I began to to suspect that the guy was messing with us .That turned out to be the case , as ICE officially listed the sites and that guy 's site was n't included .Miraculously , his site went back to being the same old blog it was before , a few days later .Then , for April Fools , we were actually inundated with sites telling us they had been seized by ICE and we did n't run any of those stories , knowing they were bogus .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"107.552284"}
