{"text":"Some of it is militaristic , yes , because that was written by a person over two centuries ago .Ever noticed that we do n't publicly execute(hang , behead ) criminals anymore ?It 's the same principal .What seems incredibly violent and bloodthirsty now was less severe then and it 's obviously going to be militaristic , considering that it is a reference to a war .As people evolved from that time into a more peaceful era , our naturally violent natures subsided a little .Yes , they still had war after all those years and when they chose the national anthem , but not something as serious as a battle for independence .That 's why only that particular part of the anthem is the part we sing and are taught .The rest of the poem really is n't relevant to what the people choosing the anthem wanted .Nevertheless , humans do have a violent nature and quite a bit today .There 's plenty of violence in media and everyday life that people just seem to find normal today whereas that poem is about a time of war .If someone was trying to takeover the country today , we 'd obviously be fighting back , so take time to actually think about when this poem was written and the person who wrote it .Either way , it is still a beautifully written poem and a very important part of our culture , so it is not like it can just be changed on a whim .As for the words , yes , some of them are quite archaic and the writing style may seem odd to modern society , but one must take into mind the mood and tone .The style of writing is the way it is because the author was going for a specific mood that he wanted the piece to convey ; it instills a feeling of triumph and I think he did a great job with what he was trying to do .Of course , if you 're not a writer , you probably would n't understand this or even think about it , but that 's modern society for you .Less romantic and passionate and more boring , if you ask me .Thus , with the points I 've presented , I do not believe that there is problem with our current anthem , its wording , or anything else mentioned here .Seriously , if I , a sophomore in highschool , took the time to actually formulate an opinion about this and thoroughly research the material before , then it should n't be difficult for anyone else .As for Aguilera , she made a very poor performance and I 'm not going to even try and justify it .I was taught the anthem in Kindergarten and have remembered it since and the tone and notes of singing the actual song has nothing to do with forgetting words .And even if she did n't remember the words , could she not have made the effort to rehearse before her performance ?","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.55752"}

{"text":"By enacting laws that ultimately prevented blacks from obtaining equal education and attaining positions of power within society whites were able to keep a grasp on their control of the country .Jim Crow laws may have dictated how whites and blacks interacted for almost a century but they were not without opposition .One of the most famous challenges to these laws came from a man named Homer Plessy .In collaboration with an anti - Jim Crow group he sought to challenge the law by attempting to sit in a whites only train car leaving New Orleans .He was asked to leave the car but refused and was subsequently arrested .This resulted in a court case ( Plessy v. Ferguson ) challenging the constitutionality of separate but equal policies .It went all the way to the supreme court where Plessy and his cohorts lost their case .Despite challenges such as Plessy v. Ferguson Jim Crow laws would remain in effect until 1965 when the Civil Rights Movement finally brought about the most dramatic stride in attaining equal status for African Americans with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and The Voting Rights Act in 1965 .The End of Segregation and the Civil Rights Era .This essay is an example of a student 's work .Disclaimer .Throughout the Jim Crow era there was pressure to achieve greater equality between blacks and whites mainly through litigation .This push for desegregation began to heighten in the mid 1950 's when civil rights activists began to employ more direct forms of protest .Mass protests , civil disobedience , and continued legal challenges to segregation laws helped to propel the United States toward a new era of equality .There were many factors that led to the start of the civil rights movement starting in the early 1900 's .An important contributing factor was the migration of African Americans from rural areas in the south to urban and industrial centers throughout the country .This migration was spurred primarily by higher wage jobs and the promise of better social conditions including the right to vote .In the north blacks were able to attain more prominent positions in the community , positions which offered them opportunities to advance the civil rights cause in many areas of the country .Even African Americans in the South began to move to urban centers where they were better able to organize against segregation .By the mid 1950 's significant changes were beginning to come about .Plessy v. Ferguson was overturned , along with another case regarding segregation in schools .Perhaps the most famous ruling of the Civil Rights Era was Brown v. Board of Education .This ruling not only brought about the desegregation of schools but also spurred the end of segregation as an institution .As the 1960 's were ushered in widespread protests , boycotts , and civil disobedience brought about massive changes .Schools from elementary to universities were integrated , voting rights were restored , and discrimination in housing , employment , and other institutions was outlawed .Though the gains made were significant , they did not come without opposition , struggle , and setbacks .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"91.20448"}

{"text":"One of the most famous challenges to these laws came from a man named Homer Plessy .In collaboration with an anti - Jim Crow group he sought to challenge the law by attempting to sit in a whites only train car leaving New Orleans .He was asked to leave the car but refused and was subsequently arrested .This resulted in a court case ( Plessy v. Ferguson ) challenging the constitutionality of separate but equal policies .It went all the way to the supreme court where Plessy and his cohorts lost their case .Despite challenges such as Plessy v. Ferguson Jim Crow laws would remain in effect until 1965 when the Civil Rights Movement finally brought about the most dramatic stride in attaining equal status for African Americans with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and The Voting Rights Act in 1965 .The End of Segregation and the Civil Rights Era .This essay is an example of a student 's work .Disclaimer .Throughout the Jim Crow era there was pressure to achieve greater equality between blacks and whites mainly through litigation .This push for desegregation began to heighten in the mid 1950 's when civil rights activists began to employ more direct forms of protest .Mass protests , civil disobedience , and continued legal challenges to segregation laws helped to propel the United States toward a new era of equality .There were many factors that led to the start of the civil rights movement starting in the early 1900 's .An important contributing factor was the migration of African Americans from rural areas in the south to urban and industrial centers throughout the country .This migration was spurred primarily by higher wage jobs and the promise of better social conditions including the right to vote .In the north blacks were able to attain more prominent positions in the community , positions which offered them opportunities to advance the civil rights cause in many areas of the country .Even African Americans in the South began to move to urban centers where they were better able to organize against segregation .By the mid 1950 's significant changes were beginning to come about .Plessy v. Ferguson was overturned , along with another case regarding segregation in schools .Perhaps the most famous ruling of the Civil Rights Era was Brown v. Board of Education .This ruling not only brought about the desegregation of schools but also spurred the end of segregation as an institution .As the 1960 's were ushered in widespread protests , boycotts , and civil disobedience brought about massive changes .Schools from elementary to universities were integrated , voting rights were restored , and discrimination in housing , employment , and other institutions was outlawed .Though the gains made were significant , they did not come without opposition , struggle , and setbacks .The assassinations of John F. Kennedy in 1963 and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 were major blows , however the groundwork they helped to lay ultimately led to the continued success of the movement .In addition to these losses civil rights activists and the African American population as a whole continued to suffer injustices at the hand of whites in power .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.270035"}

{"text":"Today 's ruling by the Eighth Circuit technically removes another chip from the player 's bargaining table , as the league has essentially been allowed for the time being to keep players locked out .This result was obtained by the court system through which the non - union represented players sought antitrust relief .This reflects the difficult battle that plaintiffs face when seeking relief to end a dispute with a league using antitrust remedies rather than bargaining power through a union .Therefore , I maintain that in labor disputes between leagues and players , it is best for the union which represents players to stay its course and negotiate steadfastly with the league ( even after the imposition of a lockout ) .Only when a clear impasse arises , should a players union seek to decertify and pursue the course of antitrust relief .Yesterday , Ruling Sports discussed why the National Basketball Players Association ( \" NBPA \" ) should wait until November , at the earliest , to decertify .Today 's focus is on how the decertification of players associations adversely affects the bargaining power of players after the conclusion of a labor dispute and extends the length of labor disputes .The body of law in the United States which largely governs how employers can respond to the actions taken by labor unions is the National Labor Relations Act .Violations of the National Labor Relations Act , which include the refusal of employers to bargain collectively , are prosecuted by the National Labor Relations Board .Thus , in the simplest sense , an impasse in negotiations between employers and labor unions should be dealt with by the National Labor Relations Board .However , as discussed here yesterday , the alternative to allowing the National Labor Relations Board to resolve issues when negotiations between employers and labor unions are at a standstill , is for the union to decertify and proceed with antitrust remedies .The question remains , though , if after the conclusion of a labor dispute , a labor union will resume as an entity with strong bargaining power if it decertifies during the course of the dispute .Some guidance on this question can be found in the bargaining history of the NFLPA and NBPA in previous labor disputes .NFLPA .Founded in 1956 , the NFLPA has endured three labor disputes during the course of its recognition as the labor union representing NFL players .The 1982 NFL strike , largely resulting from negotiations over gross revenues given by teams to players , lasted for 57 days and did not result in the NFLPA decertifying .While the 1987 NFL strike only resulted in the cancellation of one week of the season , as teams brought in replacement players and the NFLPA voted to return to play in October , 1987 .However , this return to play was made without the support of a newly negotiated and agreed upon collective bargaining agreement .Thus , without a collective bargaining agreement , the players rights and interests were largely left unprotected .Thereafter , still without a collective bargaining agreement , the NFLPA decertified in 1989 , and several antitrust lawsuits were filed on behalf of individual players .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"110.034966"}
