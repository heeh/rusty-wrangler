{"text":"An Open Letter to the Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran : .It has come to our attention while observing your nuclear negotiations with our government that you may not fully understand our constitutional system .Thus , we are writing to bring to your attention two features of our Constitution - the power to make binding international agreements and the different character of federal offices - which you should seriously consider as negotiations progress .First , under our Constitution , while the president negotiates international agreements , Congress plays the significant role of ratifying them .In the case of a treaty , the Senate must ratify it by a two - thirds vote .A so - called congressional - executive agreement requires a majority vote in both the House and the Senate ( which , because of procedural rules , effectively means a three - fifths vote in the Senate ) .Anything not approved by Congress is a mere executive agreement .Second , the offices of our Constitution have different characteristics .For example , the president may serve only two 4-year terms , whereas senators may serve an unlimited number of 6-year terms .As applied today , for instance , President Obama will leave office in January 2017 , while most of us will remain in office well beyond then - perhaps decades .What these two constitutional provisions mean is that we will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear - weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei .The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time .We hope this letter enriches your knowledge of our constitutional system and promotes mutual understanding and clarity as nuclear negotiations progress .\" The critical role of Congress in the adoption of international agreements was clearly laid out by our Founding Fathers in our Constitution .And it 's a principle upon which Democrats and Republicans have largely agreed .In fact , then - Sen .Joe Biden once reflected on this very topic , writing that \" the president and the Senate are partners in the process by which the United States enters into , and adheres to , international obligations .It 's not often I agree with former senator and now Vice President Biden , but his words here are clear .The Senate must approve any deal President Obama negotiates with Iran by a two - thirds majority vote .Anything less will not be considered a binding agreement when President Obama 's term expires in two years .This is true of any agreement , but in particular with the nuclear deal President Obama intends to strike with Iran .Unfortunately , despite our best efforts , the Obama administration has so far completely bypassed Congress in its negotiations with Iran .The administration cares little about what will win congressional approval - only complete nuclear disarmament - and more about just reaching some sort of deal .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.59861"}

{"text":"First , are the provisions of the clause exclusive - that is , does it provide the only way that the United States may enter into international obligations ?Article I , Section 10 , in describing restrictions upon the states , speaks of \" Treat[ies ] \" and \" Agreement[s] ... with a foreign Power \" as two distinct categories .Some scholars believe this shows that not all international agreements are treaties , and that these other agreements would not need to go through the procedures of the Treaty Clause .Instead , the President , in the exercise of his executive power , could conclude such agreements on his own .Still , this exception for lesser agreements would have to be limited to \" agreements \" of minor importance , or else it would provide too great an avenue for evasion of the protections the Framers placed in the Treaty Clause .A second question is how the President and Senate should interact in their joint exercise of the treaty power .Many Framers apparently thought that the President would oversee the actual conduct of diplomacy , but that the Senate would be involved from the outset as a sort of executive council advising the President .This was likely a reason that the Framers thought the smaller Senate was more suited than the House to play a key role in treaty - making .In the first effort at treaty - making under the Constitution , President George Washington attempted to operate in just this fashion .He went to the Senate in person to discuss a proposed treaty before he began negotiations .What is less clear , however , is whether the Constitution actually requires this process , or whether it is only what the Framers assumed would happen .The Senate , of course , is constitutionally authorized to offer \" advice \" to the President at any stage of the treaty - making process , but the President is not directed ( in so many words ) as to when advice must be solicited .As we shall see , this uncertainty has led , in modern practice , to a very different procedure than some Framers envisioned .It seems clear , however , that the Framers expected that the Senate 's \" advice and consent \" would be a close review and not a mere formality , as they thought of it as an important check upon presidential power .A third difficult question is whether the Treaty Clause implies a Senate power or role in treaty termination .Scholarly opinion is divided , and few Framers appear to have discussed the question directly .One view sees the power to make a treaty as distinct from the power of termination , with the latter being more akin to a power of implementation .Since the Constitution does not directly address the termination power , this view would give it to the President as part of the President 's executive powers to conduct foreign affairs and to execute the laws .When the termination question first arose in 1793 , Washington and his Cabinet , which included Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson , embraced this view .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.638405"}

{"text":"So I just want to repeat , the good news is that because of extraordinary efforts from law enforcement as well as our military intelligence , we are doing a better job at preventing any large - scale attacks on the homeland .On the other hand , the small , individual lone wolf attacks or small cells become harder to detect and they become more sophisticated , using new technologies .And that means that we 're going to have to pick up our game to prevent these attacks .It 's also true why , ultimately , in order for us to defeat terrorist groups like ISIL and al Qaeda it 's going to also require us to discredit their ideology - the twisted thinking that draws vulnerable people into their ranks .As I 've said before - and I know our military leaders agree - this broader challenge of countering violent extremism is not simply a military effort .Ideologies are not defeated with guns ; they 're defeated by better ideas - a more attractive and more compelling vision .So the United States will continue to do our part , by working with partners to counter ISIL 's hateful propaganda , especially online .We 'll constantly reaffirm through words and deeds that we will never be at war with Islam .We 're fighting terrorists who distort Islam and whose victims are mostly Muslims .But around the world , we 're also going to insist on partnering with Muslim communities as they seek security , prosperity and the dignity that they deserve .And this larger battle for hearts and minds is going to be a generational struggle .It 's ultimately not going to be won or lost by the United States alone .It will be decided by the countries and the communities that terrorists like ISIL target .It 's going to be up to Muslim communities , including scholars and clerics , to keep rejecting warped interpretations of Islam , and to protect their sons and daughters from recruitment .It will be up to all people - leaders and citizens - to reject the sectarianism that so often fuels the resentments and conflicts upon which terrorists are currently thriving .It will be up to governments to address the political and economic grievances that terrorists exploit .Nations that empower citizens to decide their own destiny , that uphold human rights for all their people , that invest in education and create opportunities for their young people - those can be powerful antidotes to extremist ideologies .Those are the countries that will find a true partner in the United States .In closing , let me note that this Fourth of July we celebrated 239 years of American independence .Across more than two centuries , we 've faced much bigger , much more formidable challenges than this - Civil War , a Great Depression , fascism , communism , terrible natural disasters , 9/11 .And every time , every generation , our nation has risen to the moment .We do n't simply endure ; we emerge stronger than before .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"91.62163"}
{"text":"The upcoming G-8 summit in St. Petersburg that President Putin is hosting will be fascinating diplomacy to follow between the major powers in attendance .Given South Korean government and youth opinion becoming increasingly negative towards the United States , and in some cases seeing the US as a larger threat than North Korea , I have given increased thoughts to a phased US pullout .In attempting to reason through what is in the best interests of US foreign policy in Asia and secondly the best interests of our allies in the region , including South Korea , Japan , Taiwan and even Australia , I have looked at several areas .The three main areas are 1 ) US strategic and military planning in the region 2 ) South Korea 's newly announced Defense Reform Plan and 3 ) Effects on potential regional threats , including North Korea and China .Preface - The Korean War .The Korean War started on June 25 , 1950 as Communist North Korea launched a surprise attack against South Korea .For over three years , until a cease - fire was agreed to in late July 1953 , several million people died , including Koreans , Chinese , Americans , British , and Canadians , with massive civilian casualties .Due to the surprise nature of the attack and the fact that South Korea was not prepared for war , the Communists nearly succeeded in overrunning the country .President Truman interpreted the U.N. call for support as an authorization to commit United States troops , which he did , albeit without submission to Congress , the branch of government which , under the Constitution , has the duty to declare war .U.S. and U.N. troops were placed under the command of American Five Star General Douglas MacArthur .As the allies pushed towards the Chinese border with North Korea , the Chinese entered the war in October , 1950 .One of many heroic battles by U.S. troops took place as Army and Marine forces fought at the Chosin Reservoir after being encircled by a numerically superior Chinese Army .This brave and tragic battle is recounted well in Martin Russ 's gripping \" Breakout : The Chosin Reservoir Campaign , Korea 1950 \" .Political influences and apparently personal failings in Washington , D.C. led to the abandonment of the customary tradition of fighting a war to victory , and by mid 1951 , the Korean War had entered a stalemate as casualties , both military and civilian , mounted .The War was stabilized along the 38th parallel that today is the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) separating the two Koreas .It is the most heavily armed and defended border in the world today .The United States has kept its commitment to defending South Korea from any end to the cease - fire or from any attack by North Korea .While there has not been active fighting between the two Koreas since 1953 , the fact there is no negotiated peace makes the stability of the region a larger issue for US national security than other nations that enjoy a US security arrangement .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.21408"}

United States ( 2001 ) .On the other hand , arguments for \" complete interchangeability\"-that is , claims that anything that can be done by treaty can be done by congressional - executive agreement - seem counter to the Framers ' intent .The Framers carefully considered the supermajority rule for treaties and adopted it in response to specific threats to the Union ; finding a complete alternative to the Treaty Clause would in effect eliminate the supermajority rule and make important international agreements easier to adopt than the Framers wished .The third type of executive agreement is one adopted by the President without explicit approval of either the Senate or the Congress as a whole .The Supreme Court and modern practice embrace the idea that the President may under some circumstances make these so - called sole executive agreements .United States v. Belmont ( 1937 ) ; United States v. Pink ( 1942 ) .But the scope of this independent presidential power remains a serious question .The Pink and Belmont cases involved agreements relating to the recognition of a foreign government , a power closely tied to the President 's textual power to receive ambassadors ( Article II , Section 3 ) .The courts have consistently permitted the President to settle foreign claims by sole executive agreement , but at the same time have emphasized that the Congress has acquiesced in the practice .Dames & Moore v.

John Kasich has a breakout performance in the main debate or if Carly Fiorina dominates the second - tier candidate debate earlier in the evening , the media could \" discover \" them and cause a subsequent rise in the polls .Of course , this might not happen , but a good debate performance provides a plausible springboard for a media - fueled poll bounce .It 's also possible that this debate kicks off the \" scrutiny \" phase of Trump 's candidacy .According to Sides and Vavreck , scrutiny happens after the candidate has had some time atop the polls and journalists decide to really dig into their public record and personal history .Right now Trump is firmly in the discovery phase of his candidacy .The media are still treating him as more of a celebrity than a candidate , so his policy positions and his past are getting less attention than his performance in the latest poll or his most recent bombastic statement .If the media and party establishment begin to scrutinize Trump in the way they would any other politician , it may lead to bad press and a related drop in his poll numbers - the beginning of the \" decline \" in Sides and Vavreck 's process .That 's not to say that Trump will definitely be scrutinized after the debate .And the scrutiny may have a muted or delayed effect - part of Trump 's appeal is his aggression towards the mainstream media and political establishment .But it is possible that the debate marks a turning point in how Trump is viewed - and if that 's the case , then it has potentially huge consequences .Third , and perhaps most importantly , many voters will be really introduced to these candidates for the first time .While the party and the media play a large role in influencing voters , voters themselves matter the most .There are a massive number of ways any one candidate could leverage the debate to speak to his or her desired coalition in a persuasive way , so it 's harder to play these scenarios out .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"112.14317"}
