Bennett had asked to move the trial to March 23 because the torrent of media attention to the Lewinsky matter was distracting the president from conducting the nation 's business .But the Jones camp argued that such a request was unwarranted , because the judge in the case has ruled the Lewinsky evidence out of bounds to avoid interfering with Starr 's investigation and because polls show that Clinton has not been hurt by the latest scandal .The Jones lawyers also said they plan to ask the court to wait for pretrial motions until April 1 to see how the Starr matter turns out .If Clinton is charged or convicted of a crime , they said , they want to use that to bolster their case in court .Staff writers Toni Locy , Roberto Suro , Bob Woodward , Leef Smith , Jessie Mangaliman , Ruben Castaneda and Pamela Constable contributed to this report .By Peter Baker Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday , July 15 , 1998 ; Page A01 .Independent counsel Kenneth W.

Jordan Jr. urged the 24-year - old Lewinsky to conceal a sexual relationship with the president in a sworn affidavit last month , lining up a public relations job for her in New York as an inducement to keep quiet .In her statement , sources said , Lewinsky asserted that she was not urged to lie to Jones 's lawyers , for example , but said she was told to tell a certain version of events -- one that did not actually happen .Lewinsky did not discuss the origins of one of the crucial pieces of evidence in the investigation -- the so - called talking points she gave to Linda R.

Podesta and deputy counsel Bruce R. Lindsey .The White House unsuccessfully sought to restrict questioning so that it would not cover discussions between Clinton and his staff about how to respond to the political crisis generated by Starr 's investigation .Without that assurance , White House lawyers were considering instructing aides to invoke executive privilege protecting confidential presidential communication , according to sources familiar with their strategy .Podesta is scheduled to appear before the grand jury here at 1:30 p.m. today and is prepared to testify about his involvement in arranging a job offer for Lewinsky in the New York office of United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson , according to sources close to Podesta .But if questioning veers into territory deemed off - limits by the White House , Podesta has three options , one source said : answer the question , invoke privilege or defer testimony pending further negotiation with Starr .New details also emerged yesterday about Lewinsky 's three dozen visits to the White House after she left her job there in April 1996 for a position in the Pentagon press office .A source with knowledge of Secret Service entry and exit logs said she visited the White House 10 to 12 times in the latter half of last year .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"54.275795"}

' to mean that President Clinton was attempting to improperly persuade Mrs. Currie to testify that Ms. Lewinsky was always within Mrs. Currie 's sight during her visits to the President .Based upon Ms. Lewinsky 's testimony , President Clinton 's statement that ' Monica came on to me , and I never touched her , right ? 'would clearly be false .In addition , because even President Clinton admitted to ' inappropriate intimate contact , ' I assume that President Clinton is at least admitting to having touched Ms. Lewinsky .As a result , I must conclude that President Clinton did touch Ms. Lewinsky .In his grand jury testimony , President Clinton admitted that he did not allow Mrs. Currie to ' watch whatever intimate activity [ the President ] did with Ms. Lewinsky . 'In addition , when asked whether he would ' not have engaged in those physically intimate acts if [ the President ] knew that Mrs. Currie could see or hear that , ' President Clinton responded ' [ t]hat 's correct .

Testimony concerning his account of the relationship to Betty Currie : .On January 18 , 1998 , President Clinton met with Mrs. Currie at the White House and told her ' there are several things you may want to know ' about the President 's relationship with Monica Lewinsky .During his grand jury testimony , President Clinton stated that ' I was not trying to get Betty Currie to say something that was untruthful . 'However , as discussed further in the obstruction of justice charges , President Clinton said to Mrs. Currie ' Monica came on to me , and I never touched her , right ? 'Based upon both Ms. Lewinsky and President Clinton 's testimony concerning their intimate contact , and upon Ms. Lewinsky 's Senate deposition , I must conclude that Ms. Lewinsky 's account of their intimate activity is accurate .As will be discussed further below , I conclude that President Clinton made a series of statements to Betty Currie in an attempt to improperly persuade her to provide false testimony .The President 's statements before the grand jury concerning his interest in talking to Mrs. Currie would thus constitute perjury .C. Testimony concerning his account of the relationship to Sidney Blumenthal and John Podesta : .In his grand jury testimony , President Clinton asserted in his conversations with Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Podesta , that ' I said things that were true .They may have been misleading . 'President Clinton further states that ' what I was trying to do was give them something they could -- that would be true , even if misleading in the context of this deposition . 'Mr. Clinton told Sidney Blumenthal that ' Monica Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual demand on me ' and that the President had rebuffed her .When Mr. Blumenthal asked the President whether Mr. Clinton had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky , the President replied ' I was within eyesight or earshot of someone . 'Even President Clinton acknowledges that he was alone with Monica Lewinsky , and , therefore not within eyesight or earshot of anybody , on numerous occasions .Mr. Clinton also acknowledges that he and Ms. Lewinsky engaged in ' inappropriate intimate contact ' which , if Ms. Lewinsky 's testimony is true , amounted to sexual relations as President Clinton understood the term to be defined in the Paula Jones case .As a result , the President lied , not simply misled Mr. Blumenthal , when Mr. Clinton stated that he had ' rebuffed her .
