Massar .Justice4AlanBlueford via Daily Kos .Since the shooting death of Trayvon Martin , there have been closed to 30 Black or Brown people shot and killed by law enforcement or in the case of Trayvon , wannabe law enforcement .Many of these shootings have been highly questionable , meaning the person killed was unarmed or there are strong conflicting statements from either the police or witnesses .Alan Blueford , killed by Oakland Police on the evening of May 6 , 2012 .He was out with his buddies at night , unaware that he was under martial law .He would have graduated from High School in June ( Credit : Facebook ) .Here in Oakland , California , the shooting death Alan Dwayne Blueford is one such killing .Oakland police have been very shady with the stories they put forth to the public .It seems like a deliberate attempt to muddy the waters , cast seeds of doubt and cover up their own mistakes .Initially police said they were in a shoot out and Blueford shot the officer in the stomach .Later the police said Blueford shot the officer in the leg .Next the police said that it was possible the officer was shot in the leg by another officer in a case of friendly fire .Finally it came out that the officer shot himself .He shot himself in the foot .Many believe the officer shot himself after he killed Blueford and saw the young man was unarmed .The police then double back and said a gun was recovered , the community has yet to see any evidence of finger prints , gun residue etc .Many have concluded it was the officer planting a gun near the scen .This would not be unusual in a city that in the past 10 years has had to shell out over 58 million dollars in wrongful death shootings and police brutality incidents .This would not be far - fetched in a city that was home to a rogue group of cops known as the Riders who were found to routinely plant drugs and guns on suspects .One of the Oakland Riders is a still a fugitive at large .Adding to all this was the fact that Blueford was left to on the ground for 4 hours to die while the officer who lied and then finally admitted to shooting himself was treated .The public still does not know the name of the officer thanks to California 's Policeman 's Bill of Rights which prevents the public from knowing the name of officers involved in these and other brutality incidents .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"61.575035"}

{"text":"Lol , so everyone here blaming the victim and defending the cop without having these reports are just people with opinions , but somehow because I do n't agree I 'm a troll ? ?Lmao .The hypocrisy .So because civilians are killing more people than cops , we should ignore the FACT that cops are killing unarmed civilians at alarming rates .How about all the dogs they 've killed , do we ignore that too , or are dogs more worthy of retribution than people , specifically those of color ?The worst part is no one is tracking injury and death by police force , not for humans or dogs .So you are n't seeing the big picture , which would show that police brutality is the norm .Only when people end up dead do we hear about it , sometimes not even .These kids just created an app to rate police departments , maybe some public experiences and more accountability will come from it .melmc13 .Actually , I think far too many people are making judgments in this case ( as in so many others ) without having access to the facts involved .Emotions definitely run high and thoughtful consideration seems to diminish when emotions get so heavily involved .Not to mention , insults ( and , yes , I probably should have held off on the \" Troll \" assessment ) do n't really contribute in a positive way to the conversation .I would be very surprised , though , if no one is tracking injury or death ( for animals or humans ) by police force .I will say that they have an awfully difficult job in these times .People , in general , and younger generations , in particular , are more and more disrespectful and disdainful of law enforcement ( and each other ) .I would not want to live without law enforcement personnel , because I think we would devolve very quickly into anarchy and bullying , at the very least .When there is a lack of respect for law enforcement , it is a lack of respect for society as a whole , because law enforcement personnel are among our gatekeepers .Yes , there are those that abuse their power .There are also those that do spectacular jobs in horrible circumstances .( The autopsy results that have been disclosed so far do not support the \" shot in the back \" theories in this case , and that includes the autopsy done by the medical examiner chosen by the family . )ace1981 .There are allot more police using aggressive tactics than good wholesome police .The task issue is that there is no accountability in government .Everyone trying to minimize liability has turned everything into a scandal .Here are a few more facts from the preliminary autopsy , no gun powder residue and all shots appear to have been from a distance .So what about the struggle in the car for a gun that discharged and hit him ?EVERYONE initially said he was running away when the officer fired and he turned around with his hands up .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"68.294205"}
{"text":"I want to write of the struggle to deal with it in a way that respects the dignity of the mentally ill and also the need to protect the common good .As for my sister Mary Anne and of her 30 year struggle with mental illness , I wrote last week .She had moments of great lucidity , and peace .But these moments were often punctuated by deep troubles , wherein she heard \" the voices \" who instructed her to do terrible things , acts of violence , acts that harmed her and others .In these , \" dark moments \" she perpetrated acts of violence , breaking into stores , engaging , not only in shoplifting , but also , it attempted armed robbery , breaking and entering , and other , almost pointless destruction of property .Many times she turned on herself , several times slashing her wrists , taking overdoses , trying to jump to her death .Once , she accosted my mother with a long carving knife .Another time , she successfully stabbed my mother , wounding her seriously in the middle of the night , while she slept .My sister also , set fires , and would ultimately die in a fire that she kindled .And yet in all of this , my sister Mary Anne , had many lucid moments , wherein she was gentle , kind , helpful and deeply concerned for the well - being of all of us .She was a beautiful human being who struggled mightily to keep her mental health , in the face of a horrible affliction that often overtook her .She loved God , and like all of us , sought his face and the serenity and healing that only God can give .In all of this , my parents too were engaged in a great battle .It was not a battle that was not easily defined .It was a battle that sought to protect my sisters rights , and her dignity .But it was also a battle that sought to protect the common good , which my parents rightly thought was threatened by my sister 's instability .Early in my sister 's struggle with mental illness , she was confined to the rather protected environment of mental hospitals .That said , men of these places were not pleasant .And my parents , expended many personal resources , and money to ensure that my sister was in the best of possible environments .But honestly , the protected environment of a mental hospital was best for her , that is where she an others were best protected .Somewhere , in the late 1970s , as I recall , the ACLU , and other interest groups , sued the federal government , claiming that many were being unjustly detained in mental hospitals .Having lost a series of suits , the government largely emptied the mental hospitals , resulting in a great exodus of the seriously mentally ill into our streets .As most of you know , the \" homelessness \" problem , in our large cities , was deeply rooted in mental illness .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"68.342926"}

'But he goes on to add : ' Most perpetrators of autogenic massacres do not , however , appear to have active psychotic symptoms at the time and very few even have histories of prior contact with mental health services . ' \" And most people with mental illness are not violent , although they are far more likely to be victims of crime ( see here , for instance ) .The continual disregard for this reality perpetuates stigma on all levels of society and further exposes those with mental illness to harm .5 ) Antipsychotics and antidepressants are not designed for children and most of them are not indicated for disruptive behaviour in children .Zyprexa , the prescription given to the child in the article , is not indicated for disruptive behaviour or autism in the US .However , there is no criticism of psychiatric or pharmaceutical practice in the article : merely a cry for more of the same .6 ) You are NOT Adam Lanza 's mother .Do n't do that .Share this : .Like this : . 599 Comments .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"83.941666"}

{"text":"It must expand !It must expand !A man 's brain must expand , if it breaks up the universe .\" You Are Not Adam Lanza 's Mother .Edit : a post subsequent to the response to this one can be found here .After this blog post was republished on Huffington Post , I thought it necessary to summarise the main reasons why it 's a terrible springboard for further conversation on the subject . 1 )The suggestion that this woman 's son is of the same type of person who would or will commit a \" rage murder \" , without any real evidence to back up this suggestion . 2 )The article does n't divulge , or even acknowledge , that its subject might have his own perspectives , beliefs and motivations that are worth mentioning .His mother 's perspective , mainly on his ' evil eyes ' with their ' calculated pupils ' is the only one given .Thus the child is presented solely as a problem , or at best , as a two - dimensional contradiction of his \" behavioural problems \" and his \" intelligence \" and not as a person with any more than shallow emotions .By reducing ' mental illness ' to ' outward behaviour ' the article dehumanises the mentally ill and completely glosses over the inner mental life and experiences of those with mental illness . 3 )The article complains about mental illness stigma while reinforcing it by explicitly tying it to violence , and in particular , mass killings .The reality is that there is no such observed link : \" after analysing a number of killers , Mullen concludes , ' they had personality problems and were , to put it mildly , deeply troubled people . 'But he goes on to add : ' Most perpetrators of autogenic massacres do not , however , appear to have active psychotic symptoms at the time and very few even have histories of prior contact with mental health services . ' \" And most people with mental illness are not violent , although they are far more likely to be victims of crime ( see here , for instance ) .The continual disregard for this reality perpetuates stigma on all levels of society and further exposes those with mental illness to harm .5 ) Antipsychotics and antidepressants are not designed for children and most of them are not indicated for disruptive behaviour in children .Zyprexa , the prescription given to the child in the article , is not indicated for disruptive behaviour or autism in the US .However , there is no criticism of psychiatric or pharmaceutical practice in the article : merely a cry for more of the same .6 ) You are NOT Adam Lanza 's mother .Do n't do that .Share this : .Like this : . 599 Comments .Did we read the same article ?Sounds like you read what you wanted to read in order to call somebody out about it and ... what ?Feel better about yourself ?","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"91.95549"}
