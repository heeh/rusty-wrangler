's IPCC is a political body , not a scientific one , and its findings have been subject to withering criticism .But the AP implies that the U.N 's report represents a scientific consensus : .Rather than global warming , Gray believes a recent uptick in strong hurricanes is part of a multi - decade trend of alternating busy and slow periods related to ocean circulation patterns .Contrary to mainstream thinking , Gray believes ocean temperatures are going to drop in the next five to 10 years .[ The AP positions Gray as an ] elderly crank who \" rails \" and disagrees with the U.N. is not part of \" mainstream thinking , \" notwithstanding the fact that , as the AP acknowledges , he is the world 's foremost authority on hurricanes ... .A general characteristic of Mr. Gore 's approach is to assiduously ignore the fact that the earth and its climate are dynamic ; they are always changing even without any external forcing .To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough ; to do so in order to exploit that fear is much worse ... . ... given that the question of human attribution largely can not be resolved , its use in promoting visions of disaster constitutes nothing so much as a bait - and - switch scam .That is an inauspicious beginning to what Mr. Gore claims is not a political issue but a \" moral \" crusade .[And ] there is a clear attempt to establish truth not by scientific methods but by perpetual repetition ... .Dr. Claude Allegre is another example .Twenty years ago , Allegre raised the possibility that burning fossil fuels could result in an increase in mean global temperature .However : .Since then , governments throughout the western world and bodies such as the United Nations [ IPCC ] have commissioned billions of dollars worth of research by thousands of scientists .With a wealth of data now in , Dr. Allegre has recanted his views .To his surprise , the many climate models and studies failed dismally in establishing a man - made cause of catastrophic global warming .Meanwhile , increasing evidence indicates that most of the warming comes of natural phenomena .Dr. Allegre now sees global warming as over - hyped and an environmental concern of second rank ... .In fact , many scientists have pinned \" global warming \" on solar activity .\" It 's the sun , stupid ! \" ...The observed global warming may be explained by increased solar activity , the present level of solar activity is historically high as determined by sunspot activity and other factors .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"53.073868"}

{"text":"How do you forecast the weather ahead of time ?Thank You , Katie Charlton , MA .Katie , In order to forecast the weather , we first must know what the weather is doing right now .To do this , meteorologists use several tools : thermometers to measure temperature , barometers to measure air pressure , and anemometers to measure wind speed .Meteorologists also launch weather balloons to get these measurements higher in the atmosphere .There are also weather satellites orbiting Earth taking pictures of clouds and making other weather measurements .These pictures help us see where and how weather systems are moving .The satellites also help us get weather data over the oceans .In addition , we use weather radar to get information about precipitation and storms .The radar unit shoots a radio signal into a cloud , which bounces back and shows us , among other things , if there is rain or snow falling and how intense the precipitation is .But the best tools we have are our eyes , and the eyes of other weather observers .There are people all over the world making weather observations of clouds , precipitation , wind , and temperature .They relay that information to other meteorologists all over the world so we can know how the weather is changing from place to place .Then we can plot that information on a weather map every hour and see how fast the weather is changing .When we can see the direction and how fast air masses are moving , as well as where it is raining or snowing , we can get an idea of when and if it might move into the area that we are forecasting for .We also take all these weather observations and put the numbers into several computers , which use complicated formulas to come up with a forecast for the next several days .Using these computer forecasts , using our knowledge of how the weather works , and using our knowledge of what the weather does normally under a certain set of circumstances , we make can come up with a forecast of weather for the hours and days to come .Nick .Rainfall can affect temperatures in a number of ways , or perhaps not at all .When it 's raining , you 're going to have clouds , and clouds will block the sunlight from warming the earth .In the evening or all night , this may work the other way .If the earth has already been warmed and then clouds form in the late afternoon or evening , the clouds tend to hold the heat closer to earth and it 's warmer , whereas if the sky cleared , the heat would escape into space and temperatures would cool .Also , humid air can hold onto the heat more than dry air can .So if it has rained recently making the air more humid , the temperature of the air is potentially higher than if it were not as humid .One more thing , rain is often accompanied by a front .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"75.85318"}

D. 800 - 1200 , warmer arctic temperatures caused a retreat of ice in the sounds and channels of the archipelago .With the expansion of baleen whales throughout most of the archipelago , Thule whaling culture followed rapidly and eventually reached Greenland , Southampton Island , and both the east and west shores of Hudson Bay .Our sites are thought to have been abandoned during the early 13th century as a response to deteriorating climate .The Neo - Atlantic period ended about A. D. 1200 and the Pacific period of colder temperatures and unstable climatic conditions began .Ice again choked the archipelago channels and an almost total dependency on other sea mammals and caribou began .This climatic shift was rapid , lasting probably only several decades .In other words the melting also happened a thousand years ago , and lo the polar bears suvived , our ancestors did not drown , and perhaps its about time to stop the panic .Global warming or not !Human species will get wipe out sooner or later either by nature causes of by human actions just like the dino .Hopefully the species are much more intelligent then the previous generation \" us \" .Al Gore got me to think a lot deeper about this do - or - die issue .You may nitpick some of his examples , but frankly , judging by how the climate news changes so rapidly , I suspect your experts could as easily get your Pinocchio award as Mr. Gore .He 's got the bulk of it right , and he 's opened people eyes .This factchecker venture is a total joke .The Post should shut it down before their reputation is further tarnished .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"85.42465"}

{"text":"On the Observational Determination of Climate Sensitivity and Its Implications Richard S. Lindzen1 and Yong - Sang Choi2 .We argue that feedbacks are largely concentrated in the tropics , and the tropical feedbacks can be adjusted to account for their impact on the globe as a whole .Indeed , we show that including all CERES data ( not just from the tropics ) leads to results similar to what are obtained for the tropics alone - though with more noise .We again find that the outgoing radiation resulting from SST fluctuations exceeds the zerofeedback response thus implying negative feedback .In contrast to this , the calculated TOA outgoing radiation fluxes from 11 atmospheric models forced by the observed SST are less than the zerofeedback response , consistent with the positive feedbacks that characterize these models .The results imply that the models are exaggerating climate sensitivity .The problem for global warming supporters is they actually need for past warming from CO2 to be higher than 0.7C.If the IPCC is correct that based on their high - feedback models we should expect to see 3C of warming per doubling of CO2 , looking backwards this means we should already have seen about 1.5C of CO2-driven warming based on past CO2 increases .But no matter how uncertain our measurements , it 's clear we have seen nothing like this kind of temperature rise .Past warming has in fact been more consistent with low or even negative feedback assumptions .Ironically , commercial greenhouses inject CO2 into the greenhouse to increase yield and reduce growing times .The optimum level of atmospheric CO2 for plant growth is 1000 ppm to 1500 ppm .Plants loss roughly 50 % of the water they absorb due to transrespiration .As atmospheric CO2 levels rise plants can reduce the number of stomata on their leaves which enables them to reduce water loss .Greenhouse Gas Might Green UpThe Desert ; Weizmann Institute Study Suggests That Rising Carbon Dioxide Levels Might Cause Forests To Spread Into Dry Environments .The Weizmann team found , to its surprise , that the Yatir forest is a substantial \" sink \" ( CO2-absorbing site ) : its absorbing efficiency is similar to that of many of its counterparts in more fertile lands .However , the Yatir forest is growing at a relatively quick pace , and is even expanding further into the desert .Plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis , which leads to the production of sugars .But to obtain it , they must open pores in their leaves and consequently lose large quantities of water to evaporation .The plant must decide which it needs more : water or carbon dioxide .Yakir suggests that the 30 percent increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide since the start of the industrial revolution eases the plant 's dilemma .Under such conditions , the plant does n't have to fully open the pores for carbon dioxide to seep in - a relatively small opening is sufficient .Consequently , less water escapes the plant 's pores .This efficient water preservation technique keeps moisture in the ground , allowing forests to grow in areas that previously were too dry .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"89.45647"}

{"text":"Deb , Wind direction is very important in meteorology because it can determine whether cool or warm air will flow over an area , or whether moist or dry air will influence an area 's weather .When we talk about a northwest wind , what we mean is that the wind is blowing from the northwest ( which would mean toward the southeast ) .Sometimes you might hear us say , \" Wind is out of the northwest , \" or \" a northwesterly wind .\" It all means the same direction .Nick , I understand that leaves turn upside down when a storm is coming .Why is that ?Kelli Stony Point , NC Kelli , .A common weather proverb says , \" When leaves show their undersides , be very sure that rain betides .\" It is true that before rain , some leaves , such as those of the poplar tree , curl up or turn upside down .This is because before the rain comes , the humidity , or amount of moisture in the air , rises .The moist air makes the stalks of the leaves softer , so they can be more easily lifted by the wind .Different types of leaves will react differently to changes in the weather .Horticulturists also say that dandelions , clover , and tulips all fold their petals just before rain .The reason for each is the increasing humidity in the air .Bear in mind that this leafy \" forecast \" is only for the immediate future , that is , over the next few minutes to the next few hours , and only for the immediate area .Paul , Like so many questions , the answer to this one is : it depends .In the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere , which include the United States , most of Europe and much of Asia , the prevailing wind flow is from the west .However , in much of the tropics in the Northern Hemisphere , winds are primarily from the east .But even over the U.S. we often see storm systems moving in ways other than the familiar west - to - east direction .One reason for this is that Earth 's rotation tends to turn winds in the Northern Hemisphere clockwise around high pressure areas and counter - clockwise around low pressure areas .So while large - scale storm systems may move basically from west to east , it 's often more like northwest to southeast or southwest to northeast .And in the case of smaller - scale storms , they can move in any direction , depending on local winds and air pressure differences .Although scientists give air pressure readings in other units of measurement called \" millibars \" or \" hectopascals , \" the National Weather Service still gives air pressure in \" inches of mercury \" because we have become so familiar with that measurement .The term \" inches of mercury \" dates back to the first barometers , which consisted of a glass tube in a dish of mercury .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"89.82922"}

{"text":"Close to half of the sea level rise observed since the 1970s has been caused by water expansion due to increases in ocean temperatures .Sea level is also rising due to melting from continental glaciers and from ice sheets on both Greenland and Antarctica .Locally , sea level changes can depend also on other factors such as slowly rising or falling land , which results in some local sea level changes much larger or smaller than the global average .Even small rises in sea level in coastal zones are expected to lead to potentially severe impacts , especially in small island nations and in other regions that experience storm surges associated with vigorous weather systems .Why is climate changing ?Climate is always changing .However , many of the observed changes noted above are beyond what can be explained by the natural variability of the climate .It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human - induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , chlorofluorocarbons , methane , and nitrous oxide .The most important of these over the long term is CO2 , whose concentration in the atmosphere is rising principally as a result of fossil - fuel combustion and deforestation .While large amounts of CO2 enter and leave the atmosphere through natural processes , these human activities are increasing the total amount in the air and the oceans .Approximately half of the CO2 put into the atmosphere through human activity in the past 250 years has been taken up by the ocean and terrestrial biosphere , with the other half remaining in the atmosphere .Since long - term measurements began in the 1950s , the atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing at a rate much faster than at any time in the last 800,000 years .Having been introduced into the atmosphere it will take a thousand years for the majority of the added atmospheric CO2 to be removed by natural processes , and some will remain for thousands of subsequent years .Water vapor also is an important atmospheric greenhouse gas .Unlike other greenhouse gases , however , the concentration of water vapor depends on atmospheric temperature and is controlled by the global climate system through its hydrological cycle of evaporation - condensation - precipitation .Water vapor is highly variable in space and time with a short lifetime , because of weather variability .Observations indicate an increase in globally averaged water vapor in the atmosphere in recent decades , at a rate consistent with the response produced by climate models that simulate human - induced increases in greenhouse gases .This increase in water vapor also strengthens the greenhouse effect , amplifying the impact of human - induced increases in other greenhouse gases .Human activity also affects climate through changes in the number and physical properties of tiny solid particles and liquid droplets in the atmosphere , known collectively as atmospheric aerosols .Examples of aerosols include dust , sea salt , and sulfates from air pollution .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.803665"}
{"text":"Should I adjust my barometer further or for our purposes is it close enough ?Thanks so much for any feedback .Smiley Queens , NY .Dear Smiley , .As you know , air pressure decreases with altitude , so the measured air pressure over land is usually less than what the value would be at sea level .On weather maps , the raw air pressure observations at various locations and elevations are adjusted to what the air pressure measurements would be at those locations if the air extended all the way to sea level .Your eighth floor elevation may even make a slight difference .But if your barometer is adjusted for your general elevation your readings are probably pretty close to what they should be .Good luck on the class weather station !Nick , how did you become interested in weather ?What do I need to do to have a career in weather ?Karen Seattle , WA .Karen , .The more I learn about weather , the more I want to know .Since scientists make new weather discoveries all the time , there is always something new to learn .I was working at a television station in Seattle when one of the weathermen left suddenly for another job .My boss asked me to fill in for a few weeks until he found a replacement .I liked the job so much that I started taking it more seriously .Shortly thereafter , a life - threatening wind storm brought hurricane force winds to Seattle and I realized what a huge responsibility weather forecasting really is .Start observing the weather around you every day .Take notice of the different kinds of clouds and what kind of weather they bring .Notice when the weather warms up and cools down , read books and watch The Weather Channel to find out what makes the weather change .Who knows ?Maybe you can take my place someday !Nick , Winds often die down at sunset .When I sail on Lake Michigan , I notice that the winds usually return to their normal range within an hour or two after sunset .Do you have an explanation for both of these phenomena ?Louis Chicago .Dear Louis , .Part of the reason winds die down at night is because the ground surface cools down fast .There is just not enough heat in the soil to compensate for how fast the heat radiates away from the surface .Because of the cooling , the air near the ground becomes more stable ; that is , there is not as much vertical motion of the air .This keeps the faster winds higher in the atmosphere from mixing down to the ground , unless there is a weather system that could force them down to lower levels .But it is the lack of mixing between the air near the ground and the air higher in the atmosphere that is largely responsible for the slower wind at night .As you know , air in contact with the ground is always slower than that above , because friction with the ground slows its speed .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.87186"}

{"text":"How is rain measured by these gauges ?We know it 's in inches , but neither of the gauges measures properly with a ruler .Why is that ?Krista .Dear Krista , .It is possible that two rain gauges not far from one another could measure different amounts .Rain showers may be heavier in one location than in another fewer than 100 yards away .Or one rain gauge may be near a building or other structure that blocks the rain from it if the wind blows from the direction of the structure .Another explanation could be that if a few hours pass before you take the measurements , one gauge may have received more evaporation than the other , especially if one gauge is in the sun and another in the shade .Tiny variations in the wind , perhaps even caused by the adjacent rain gauge can influence how much rain falls in one versus how much rain is blown over the top or around it .The opening of an official National Weather Service rain gauge ( and perhaps the one you have too ) is ten times the area of the opening of the measuring cylinder .That means a ten - inch long cylinder would hold one inch of rain .This allows us to measure rain in smaller increments , usually in hundredths .NWS rain gauges are also surrounded by wind baffles , which allow more rain to fall into the gauge rather than blow over or past it .Inexpensive rain gauges often used by weather enthusiasts can have much smaller openings and different ratios that make their measurements more erratic and sensitive to local wind variations .Of course anyone can make a simple rain gauge without the ten - to - one ratio .Here 's how : With the help of an adult , cut the top part off a clear plastic soda pop bottle so the bottle is a straight cylinder from top to bottom .Put masking tape over the rough edges around the top so they wo n't cut your fingers .Using a ruler and a dark permanent marking pen , mark a scale on the bottle in inches , half inches , quarter inches , or centimeters .Place your rain gauge outside and away from walls , fences or buildings that could block the rain .After the rain stops , look at your rain gauge and write down how much rain fell at your house that day .By the way , an inch of rain in your gauge may not seem like a lot , but think about this : An inch of rain means that your area had enough rain to cover the ground one inch deep .That equals more than five - and - a - half gallons of water for every square yard , or more than seventeen MILLION gallons of water per square mile !Dear Nick , How do you forecast the weather ?What kinds of machines do you use ?How do you forecast the weather ahead of time ?Thank You , Katie Charlton , MA .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.909805"}

Lenox 's 4th grade class McDonough , GA .When we show you the air pressure numbers inside a tropical depression , tropical storm or hurricane , we give the pressure readings in both inches of mercury and in millibars .Inches of mercury are the familiar standard of air pressure measurement in the United States .The scale refers to how high the mercury rises in a barometer due to air pressure .Millibars , also called hectopascals , are the standard method of air pressure measurement for meteorologists .Unlike an inch of mercury , a millibar is the unit of pressure in the metric system , like pounds per square inch would be the unit used to express air pressure in the U.S. Since they refer to a direct measurement of pressure , millibars can be used in metric - based mathematics to calculate weather conditions .One millibar is equal to .02953 inches of mercury .To give you some perspective , the average pressure at sea level is 29.92 inches of mercury or 1013.25 millibars .On the other hand , the air pressure in a category three hurricane is 27.91 to 28.47 inches on average , or 945 to 964 millibars .Air pressure decreases with altitude , so the measured air pressure over land is usually less than what the value would be at sea level .When determining the temperature , is the thermometer in the shade or in the sun ?Is n't the temperature the same whether it is in the sun or in the shade ?Alan Venice , Florida .Alan , .There are a lot of factors that go into temperature .The temperature over hard surfaces such as pavement , roofs , and walls will be warmer than the temperature over flat grassy areas .And direct sunlight can have a lot to do with that temperature difference .To give an accurate air temperature , you always want to make sure your thermometer is shaded and away from hard surfaces .This is because direct sunlight heats up most solid objects ( including thermometers ) more than the air away from them .This allows the air to flow through to the thermometer while keeping direct sunlight off the instrument .Official thermometers are also up about four feet off the ground , over grass ( but away from the shade of trees ) , and away from buildings or pavement , so the heat from those surfaces will not result in an inaccurately warm reading .We have two rain gauges .After a storm , one had 3.3 inches in it the other only measured 2.5 inches .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"100.17497"}

GUBB , Chairman of the Board , Philco Corporation , Philadelphia , Pa. .Delivered Before the Cornell Club of Michigan , Detroit , Michigan , October 17 , 1945 .Vital Speeches of the Day , Vol .XII , pp .90 - 94 .RADAR and the atomic bomb were unquestionably the two outstanding scientific developments of World War II .The atomic bomb came in the last few days before Japan 's capitulation , but radar and its many developments had already made a tremendous contribution to winning the German war and had brought the Japanese phase very near to a victorious conclusion .Atomic energy seems certain radically to change our technology , our industry - in fact our whole economic life .But in its practical peacetime applications , I doubt if we are to see any great transformations take place in the near future .Radar and electronics , on the other hand , because of the years of fundamental research in television , and the tremendous impetus resulting from the war in applying this fundamental research , will begin immediately in the postwar period to have peacetime applications never before dreamed of .The greatest secrecy has surrounded these radar and electronic developments during the war .Their contributions both to the offense and defense were so great that only recently have the Government authorities allowed much of the story to be told .Practically every key radar project had a code name that kept from revealing its true function .For a long time to come you will hear and read about the \" George \" , the \" Dog \" , the \" Loran \" , and \" Rebecca \" , and most spectacular of all- the \" Mickey \" .Submarine Menace .At that time , with the U - boat the major German weapon against the United States , a counter weapon had to be developed quickly , . . .and airborne radar was the answer to guide the planes quickly to the surfaced submarines and make them an easy target .The first American search radar could spot a surfaced submarine no farther than eight nautical miles .Then came the GEORGE .This was the first aircraft radar to present a complete map on its picture tube .From this circular radar picture , it was easy to tell not only the distance of a target but also its exact direction in degrees .Using the GEORGE a plane could spot a surfaced submarine 25 nautical miles away , or three times the range of the earlier equipment For a long time , the Germans did not know how our planes were so quickly and surely finding their submarines .They did not suspect that it was micro - wave radar !Gradually the Allies got the upper hand ; great numbers of the U - boats were destroyed , and our cargo ships and transports began to move more freely across the Atlantic .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"114.33916"}

Marshall , Chief of Staff of the United States Army , states that the radar equipment developed by the U. S. and Britain was superior to the electronic devices of either Germany or Japan .I could spend hours telling you of other wartime developments , but I feel that you are most interested in how this greatly expanded knowledge of electronics may be applied to our peacetime future .Electronics Peacetime Future .Thanks to the development of Radar , air travel will be far safer than ever before .Planes equipped with radar instruments should never crash into mountains in darkness or bad weather .Nor should there be collisions between planes .Passenger planes will be guided with unerring accuracy to tiny island bases in every sea and ocean .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"114.79205"}
