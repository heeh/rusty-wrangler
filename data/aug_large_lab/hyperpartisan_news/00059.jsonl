{"text":"\" The number three Republican in the Senate , Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , attended the unveiling of the Gang of Six plan and gave his support , noting , \" It helps that the three Republicans senators are three of the most conservative \" in the Senate .Meanwhile , the Republican - controlled House of Representatives , where members had complained of being \" outflanked \" on the right by Obama , sought to regain the initiative by passing Tuesday the most draconian plan ever adopted by either house of Congress .The \" Cut , Cap and Balance \" legislation passed by a near party - line vote of 234 to 190 .It would mandate $ 5.8 trillion in unspecified spending cuts over the next ten years and require adoption of a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget in return for raising the federal debt ceiling .This legislation can not pass the Democratic - controlled Senate , and Obama has repeatedly said he would veto the bill .Wall Street celebrated the increasing scale of the proposed budget cuts , from both the Senate and the House , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring 202 points Tuesday , its best showing of 2011 .The Dow began to rise sharply just after Obama made an unexpected appearance in the White House pressroom to declare his support for the Gang of Six effort .The president has been clear that he will not support a short - term extension of the debt ceiling , \" White House spokesman Jay Carney said .\" What we mean by that is we would not support a short - term extension absent an agreement to a larger deal .That 's not acceptable .Obviously , if both sides agree to something significant , we will support the measures needed to finalize the details of that . \" The clear purpose of this maneuver is to open the door to a deal along the lines of the Gang of Six proposal , which has not yet been rejected by the House Republicans .As a stopgap measure , the White House is backing the McConnell - Reid plan , which would give Obama the power to raise the debt ceiling August 2 , while requiring up to $ 1.5 trillion in spending cuts .There is still no resolution in the congressional deadlock , with House Republicans opposing any measure that would raise taxes on the wealthy , no matter how minor , and a substantial minority questioning whether breaching the debt ceiling would actually produce a broader financial crisis .House Budget Committee Chairman Ryan praised the Gang of Six proposal for lowering the tax rate for the wealthy from 35 percent to 29 percent , as well as lowering corporate tax rates , but he complained that it did not sufficiently cut healthcare spending .Meanwhile the debt rating agency Moody 's Investor Services put additional pressure on US public finances , naming five states - Maryland , New Mexico , Virginia , Tennessee and South Carolina - for potential downgrades because of their heavy reliance on federal revenues . \"Should the U.S. government 's rating be downgraded to Aa1 or lower , these five states ' ratings would likely be downgraded as well , \" Moody 's announced Tuesday .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"98.97901"}
{"text":"The Dow began to rise sharply just after Obama made an unexpected appearance in the White House pressroom to declare his support for the Gang of Six effort .Democrats , Republicans vow trillions in US spending cuts .By Patrick Martin .21 July 2011 Talks on raising the federal debt ceiling resumed at the White House Wednesday , as leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties declared their support for rival measures that would slash trillions from Social Security , Medicare and other vital federal social programs .The framework for the bipartisan budget talks continues to shift to the right , in the wake of Obama 's decision to put Social Security on the table and propose overall cuts even greater than those initially demanded by the Congressional Republicans .In the Senate , a bipartisan group of three Democrats and three Republicans , dubbed the \" Gang of Six , \" resumed its efforts to craft a budget - cutting deal , releasing a proposal Tuesday backed by all six senators .Conservative Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma left the group in May , but he returned after the three Democrats agreed to his demand for $ 117 billion in additional cuts in Medicare and Medicaid .The brief four - page outline proposed by the Gang of Six was presented to a bipartisan group of 49 senators , 25 Democrats and 24 Republicans , nearly half the total membership of the upper house .It calls for $ 3.7 trillion in spending cuts over ten years , and $ 1 trillion in \" additional revenue , \" defined in such a way that net taxes on the wealthy will decrease , not increase , in the long term .The tax rates on corporations and the wealthy would be significantly cut as part of the deal .Like proposals from Republicans in the House of Representatives , and Obama 's proposal for a \" big deal \" pegged at $ 4 trillion in deficit reduction , the Gang of Six plan is notably light on detail .All factions in the official budget debate are clearly reluctant to spell out exactly what programs will be cut and for who , for fear of the mass opposition from the American people such a declaration would inevitably provoke .The plan proposes to hold the growth of spending on Medicare and Medicaid to the rate of inflation plus 1 percent , although healthcare costs have been rising much faster than that for decades .It also calls for changes in Social Security that would require a 60-vote super - majority , and without that , the entire plan would be voided .The six senators include the number two Democrat , Majority Whip Richard Durbin of Illinois , as well as Senate Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad of North Dakota .Mark Warner of Virginia , a telecommunications multi - millionaire , is the third Democrat .The three Republicans include Coburn , Mike Crapo of Idaho , and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia .Durbin admitted that the group 's plan could not be drafted as legislation in time to meet the debt ceiling deadline August 2 .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"99.626045"}
{"text":"Mexico has entered the major leagues of methamphetamine production , a status underscored by the army 's seizure this week of 840 tons of chemicals used in the manufacture of the illegal stimulant .The army said it found a warehouse containing the chemicals near Queretaro , barely a two - hour drive north of Mexico City .As you can see in the army photo , the chemicals were neatly lined up in blue barrels and in white sacks stacked aboard pallets .A forklift is in the background .The photo indicates that the illegal drug organization behind the chemicals is sophisticated .The army said in a statement that the seizure Monday , included 787 tons of phenylacetamide and 52.5 tons of tartaric acid , chemicals required for meth production .Reuters quotes an expert here saying it may be the largest seizure of chemicals used in meth manufacture ever .No word yet on the likely Asian source country of the chemicals .I was struck by two facts at migrant centers that I visited : One was the frequency with which migrants told me they had been caught driving without a license in the U.S. , then deported .The other was how many of the migrants said they had been convicted of U.S. felonies and how lightly they treated their criminal records .After maybe the third time hearing a migrant tell me about his felony , I turned to the photographer , a Chilean friend who lives in the Bay Area , and shook my head .I wanted to say , \" A felony is a serious thing , dude .What got into you ?\" They talked about their convictions as if they were as mundane as getting the light shut off by the power company .An oversight .Bad luck .Engaging in illegality while residing in the States as an undocumented person had put in peril everything they struggled for .On the driver license issue , I know how difficult it must be to live in the U.S. without a vehicle .But risking driving also seems foolhardy .Walk , bike , take public transportation .Find a way to live close to the job site .But if you drive without a license , you are likely to get caught and deported .We talked to one Colombian - born young man who 'd lived 23 years of his life in Texas , all on the straight and narrow .Then he got busted for driving without a license .He now is in effect a stateless person .He does n't fit in in Colombia but will live only in the shadows if he makes it back to Texas .I thought of this as I read here and here how Washington state and New Mexico are again cracking down on undocumented people getting licenses .I 've read the arguments both pro and con .Denying licenses to undocumented people jeopardizes public safety and drives up insurance rates , some argue .Others like Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico say fraud rings operate as far away as Chicago to get illegal migrants driver licenses from her state .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"100.54903"}
