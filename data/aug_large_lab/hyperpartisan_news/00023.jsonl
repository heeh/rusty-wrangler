{"text":"Under previous administrations , such people were informally bused back outside the United States in what was known as \" voluntary returns .\" Under the Obama administration , these people are fingerprinted and issued formal deportation orders .This rule was expanded to all borders on January 30 , 2006 .This is not to suggest that the increased use of expedited removal to recent border crossers does not have devastating effects and should not be remedied through immigration reform measures , since many of these crossers are entering the United States to join family members .Still , it is the expanded use of expedited removal that has resulted in an increase of deportations , when under prior administrations , such persons were informally returned from the United States without terming them as deportations .Once a recent border crosser is expeditiously removed , a reentry into the United States also carries severe criminal penalties unlike a ' voluntary return .Unfortunately , the majority of people who came to the attention of the immigration enforcement authorities within the interior , resulting in deportation proceedings , are those who got arrested for minor offenses .As an aside and consistent with the topic of this article , there are instances when it can be more beneficial for a person to be placed in removal proceedings than not .Another advantage of being in removal proceedings is to escape the 3 year bar based on unlawful presence of more than 180 days but less than 1 year pursuant to INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I ) .Departing the United States under a grant of voluntary departure , which is issued prior to the alien accruing 1 year of unlawful presence , and after the commencement of proceedings , may allow this alien to reenter the United States without being subject to the 3-year bar .Finally , another tactical advantage to being placed in removal proceedings is when an application for adjustment of status is denied , and the best way to get a second chance is to have an Immigration Judge review the adjustment application de novo in proceedings .One note of caution is that those who came into the United States on a visa waiver should not consider requesting a removal proceeding as they have waived their right to a removal hearing under INA section 217(b ) .President Obama used the increased deportation statistics to show that he was enforcing the law , but this has backfired among his critics .Those who favor stricter enforcement are not satisfied with the record increase in deportations by pointing to the Administration 's expanded prosecutorial discretion policies that has resulted in the deferring of thousands of deportations .Enforcement advocates in Congress use the President 's expanded prosecutorial discretion policies , while conveniently ignoring the spike in deportations , as an excuse to delay immigration reform and cooperating with the President .At the same time , immigration advocates and allies have criticized President Obama for increasing deportations without truly bringing about genuine immigration reform .After the passage of the S. 744 , the Senate 's immigration reform bill last year , there is now a stalemate where the prospects of immigration reform in the House have almost evaporated despite unanimous agreement that the immigration system is broken .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"70.48161"}
