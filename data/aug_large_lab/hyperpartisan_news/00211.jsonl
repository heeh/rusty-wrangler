{"text":"When news of a bipartisan budget deal began to emerge Monday night , progressives immediately worried that President Obama and the Democrats in Congress would allow cuts to entitlement programs in order to strike a deal with Republicans .House Speaker John Boehner did n't do much to allay their fears , saying on Tuesday that the deal \" is the first significant reform to Social Security since 1983 .\"But budget experts say these concerns are unfounded .In fact , the deal actually shores up the finances of an important entitlement program without hurting people who have already earned their benefits .Released Monday night , the 144-page budget deal would fund the government and raise the debt ceiling for two years , punting any showdown to 2017 , after Obama has left the White House .The bill also lifts the tight federal spending caps imposed by the 2011 sequestration law .Even though the deal saves money by making small cuts to Medicare and Social Security disability insurance ( the main part of the program beyond the standard retirement benefits ) , the budget mostly tinkers around the edges .\" The agreement does n't have any changes in disability eligibility standards , \" says Paul Van de Water , a senior fellow at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .\" It does n't change the level of benefits .The small amount of savings are achieved through program integrity measures , which are just efforts to make sure the Social Security Administration is doing the best possible job of who 's actually eligible for benefits . \" These sorts of technocratic tinkers are simple measures to ensure the integrity of the programs ' goals , something pushed by both conservatives and progressives .Primarily , the deal shuts down a pilot program that allows 20 states to dish out benefits without requiring a prior medical sign - off . \"To a very small degree , that would reduce the number of people awarded benefits , well less than a percent of the number of people getting benefits , \" Van de Water says .\" This is designed to produce better decisions , not to make the program more restrictive or less generous .\"By awarding benefits slightly less frequently , the deal lengthens the solvency of the disability benefits program .For Medicare , the deal cuts costs by reducing the amount the government spends on payment rates for providers .When it comes to recipients , the deal stabilizes premiums for a group of seniors who were due for a large rate spike in 2016 .Because Social Security is n't scheduled to get a cost - of - living bump this year , premium rates wo n't rise for most people who receive Medicare .For the 30 percent of Medicare Part B recipients for whom rates would have jumped 52 percent next year , the budget deal keeps the current rates in place .But everything evens out for beneficiaries in the end , as the people who benefit this year will have to pay higher premiums down the road .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"67.91746"}

McClellan , his new top commander , frustrated the president by declining to advance against Confederate forces .As for his domestic agenda , Lincoln , like most 19th - century presidents , followed Congress 's lead .But even there , despite a Republican leadership eager to exploit the sudden absence of Southerners , major laws - the Homestead Act , the Pacific Railway Act , and the Morrill Land Grant Act - didn't get the president 's signature until 1862 .No one could say that Franklin Roosevelt began his first year in office hesitantly .His first 100 days were indeed a whirlwind of legislative and executive feats .But FDR geared his first - year efforts almost entirely toward recovery - a necessary but hardly transformative goal .Certain measures - like solving the banking crisis , which had reached catastrophic proportions on the eve of his inauguration - made a palpable difference .But the core elements of FDR 's \" First New Deal \" turned out to be , on the whole , ineffectual or unconstitutional - or both .The National Recovery Administration , the centerpiece of it all , which relied on industry leaders to agree to production codes , was flawed in both conception and execution , and it failed miserably .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.981026"}

Romney is serious about repealing Obamacare , he will have to devote all of his energies to doing that as soon as possible .The House of Representatives passed a repeal bill a few weeks after Republicans took control last year .In the Senate , many parts of Obamacare could be repealed through reconciliation with only 51 votes should Republicans take control there , allowing them to enact legislation repealing the spending provisions that are the biggest threat to the economy and to the federal deficit .He also could calm voters by emphasizing that a federal mandate to purchase health insurance is unconstitutional and detail more reasons why Obamacare 's government - centric approach is wrong .Step 2 : Explain what really happened with passage of Romneycare .Gov.

'To me , undecided voters will break for Romney in the face of a very bad economic picture , but I could be wrong .The election will be all about performance and right now the Obama administration is performing poorly .They 'll say that 's not true , but the Fed 's stats are devastating .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"75.78465"}

Heller , which held for the first time that the Second Amendment protected an individual 's right to bear arms .But Scalia was also an unvarnished , intemperate and intolerant ideologue , railing against same - sex marriage , voting rights , Obamacare , affirmative action and other progressive causes .The impact of Scalia 's death will be felt immediately in a number of pending high - profile cases , transforming anticipated 5 - 4 conservative rulings into 4 - 4 stalemates .Under the court 's rules , 4 - 4 decisions carry no precedential weight and leave intact the lower - court rulings under review .This means that proponents of affirmative action ( Fisher v. Texas ) , as well as public - employee unions ( Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association ) , can expect constitutional reprieves , because the circuit court rulings issued in their favor will be allowed to stand .It also means that supporters of abortion rights ( Whole Woman 's Health v.

How does Justice Scalia 's death affect cases the court is in the middle of hearing ? A. They proceed as if nothing happened , unless the Chief Justice instructs differently .Q. Since there are only 8 judges for a time , what happens to cases where the judges tie , 4 - 4 ?A.The decision of the lower court stands , but does not hold weight as if it were precedent laid down by the Supreme Court .The risk of 4 - 4 ties is not unusual ( though is obviously higher now ) , because Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself from a number of cases that she worked on while serving as Solicitor General prior to her confirmation .Some scholars are also suggesting they can hold the case until a nominee is confirmed .But this has to happen before the end of the session in which the case was heard .Q. What 's the longest it 's taken to confirm a Supreme Court justice ? A. It depends on how you look at it .From nomination to confirmation , the longest time taken to confirm was the 125 days before Justice Louis Brandeis took the bench in 1916 .But the longest vacancy on the court ( meaning time elapsed between a judge stepping down and their replacement being named ) happened during John Tyler 's administration ( 1844 - 46 ) .It took him two years to replace Justice Henry Baldwin , who died in office .President Obama has 342 days left in office .Q. How long will it take President Obama to nominate a replacement ? A. No one knows , obviously , but his record on the two judges he has nominated ( Justice Kagan and Justice Sonia Sotomayor ) offers a glimpse .Obama took about a month to nominate Justice Kagan after Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement .He took 26 days to nominate Justice Sotomayor after Justice David Souter 's retirement plans leaked to the media .The problem , of course , is that both Justice Stevens and Justice Souter announced they would retire at the end of the Court 's term , so a vacancy was n't technically created , unlike in this case , where Justice Scalia 's death happens mid - term .That , combined with the approaching election , could expedite Obama 's nomination .Q. How can the GOP - controlled Senate block an Obama nomination ? A. Obama submits his nominee to the Senate Judiciary committee .Of the 114 nominations submitted to the committee since its creation , only 8 times have they not submitted the nominee to the full Senate for hearings + a vote .The committee can also delay the time between the receipt and the start of confirmation hearings .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"79.044426"}

Chuck Schumer ( D. ) in 2014 .Obamacare , said Schumer , \" made no political sense .Also note that 8.6 million is a far lower figure than the number of people currently enrolled in Obamacare - sponsored products .Elsewhere in the latest Budget and Economic Outlook , CBO stated that \" average monthly enrollment of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries was ... 9.6 million [ in 2015 ] compared with 6.1 million in 2014 . \"Adding that to exchange enrollment gets you to roughly 24 million people on Obamacare - sponsored products .The Obama administration often boasts about that much larger figure , claiming that 24 million people have been helped by Obamacare .But the government 's official estimates are that it 's under 9 million .Of which only a fraction can vote in the 2016 election .Compare that to the number of people whose plans have been canceled ( 6 million ) , or the number of people who 've had their premiums or their taxes hiked ( dozens of millions ) .And that 's why Obamacare remains gravely vulnerable to repeal .This is frankly inescapable from a political perspective .If people are n't happy with the law , it does n't stay forever .The arguments about entrenchment seem much weaker in 2016 than they did in 2013-especially as states continue to refuse to expand Medicaid , a decision that frankly has n't been much of an issue on the national or local level .Tag Archives : George W Bush . 1980 56 % Carter Reagan 35 % .1984 61 % Mondale Reagan 37 % .1996 72 % Clinton Dole 21 % .2000 62 % Gore Bush 43 35 % .( After 6 yrs as Gov , Bush trails Gore by 27 % ) .2004 58 % Kerry Bush 43 40 % .2008 67 % Obama McCain 31 % .About 2.6 million illegals were amnestied in 1986 ( over a million the number projected ) , but only one fourth voted for Bush 41 in 1992 .Bob Dole supported amnesty , but he got 21 % , the lowest of all .If the Amnesty Bill is passed , it is projected that the estimated 11 million that will be legalized could be as high as 20 million , according to various sources .With those facts and the Republican Party 's track record in mind , here is George W.

Romney takes steps to clarify and remedy his position , he will continue to have trouble convincing Republican voters he is serious about repeal and will have an even harder time mapping a clear plan on health reform should he be elected president .I read all of this and see some good points , but it still comes down to leadership .We see that , as Governor , Romney tried to veto some really bad elements of the health care law , but what exactly did he do in the run up to this monstrosity ?No where do I find an effort on Romney 's part to sell his ideas to the people of Massachusetts .No where do I see an effort to get the people on his side of the battle against the legislature .If there were town halls and citizen workshops , I 'm not finding them .Now look , as a Texan , I ca n't fathom the sort of Big Government intrusion RomneyCare caused .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"84.40761"}

Nixon .The tiny ivory gavel that broke that night is still brought into the Senate chamber each day during the session , nestled in a velvetlined box that has a twin compartment housing a duplicate ivory gavel used by the presiding officer .The two gavels , almost identical , are about the size of a threeminute hourglass , such as those used by cooks to time eggs .They do not have handles , as do more traditional gavels .The original is believed to have been first used by Vice President John Adams to call the Senate to order in 1789 in New York City .There are no records of who fashioned the gavel .Nixon then set out to find a replacement .The Government of India provided a new ivory gavel , which is still used today .The gavel on the left is the original , and on the right is the 1954 replacement .The earlier gavel was in use by 1834 , and according to one account , Vice President John Adams used it to call the first Senate to order in New York City on March 4 , 1789 .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"89.81325"}

Romney gets big applause when he pledges to repeal Obamacare , but he faces silence when he tries to defend Romneycare .The voters are not reassured .Gov. Romney can get off the defensive and change the subject by explaining that the Massachusetts law which was passed by the overwhelmingly Democratic legislature diverged significantly from his vision for reform , and then describe what his reform plan would be as president .During the presidential debate in Jacksonville , Florida , in late January , Romney took a small step in this direction when he acknowledged that his successor , Gov. Deval Patrick , has taken a much more liberal track in implementing Romneycare .\" If I were governor , \" Romney said , \" it would work a heck of a lot better . \"Indeed , when it passed the law , the legislature was counting on a Democrat governor to succeed Romney to put the real regulatory thumb screws in place .The Massachusetts law is different in important ways from the plan that Romney pushed as governor .Few voters know , for example , that Romney strongly opposed the employer mandate and wanted an escape from the individual mandate - allowing people to instead be able to post a bond if they were uninsured and had big medical bills .When Romney signed the law , he believed it contained the escape hatch , but legislators removed it before final passage .Romney vetoed eight provisions of the Massachusetts bill , and every one of his vetoes was overridden by the legislature .Should Romney have known this was likely ?Yes .Should he have known exactly what he was signing ?Absolutely .But voters may be more forgiving if he tells them he wanted to give citizens and employers a way out .Why did he push Romneycare ?The state was at risk of losing $ 385 million in federal Medicaid money , and the Bush administration insisted Massachusetts make changes to get more residents covered and keep the money flowing .Romney also wanted to find a way to make it easier for small businesses and individuals to get insurance that would be portable from job to job .To get around federal tax law restrictions and to make health insurance portable , he adopted the Heritage Foundation 's proposal to create exchanges that would allow individuals to have portable insurance and pay premiums with pre - tax dollars .TODAY ROMNEY SAYS , \" The market can work to solve our health care needs .\" The policy recommendations on his campaign website back up his perspective on patient - centered reform .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.20872"}
{"text":"The agents allow the transfer to happen under circumstances where they are in control - i.e. , they are on the scene conducting surveillance of the transfer , and sometimes even participating undercover in the transfer .As soon as the transfer takes place , they can descend on the suspects , make arrests , and seize the commodity in question - all of which makes for powerful evidence of guilt .Senator Schumer 's drawing of an equivalence between \" tracing \" in a controlled - delivery situation and \" tracing \" in Fast & Furious is laughable .In a controlled delivery firearms case , guns are traced in the sense that agents closely and physically follow them - they do n't just note the serial numbers or other identifying markers .The agents are thus able to trace the precise path of the guns from , say , American dealers to straw purchasers to Mexican buyers .To the contrary , Fast & Furious involved uncontrolled deliveries - of thousands of weapons .It was an utterly heedless program in which the feds allowed these guns to be sold to straw purchasers - often leaning on reluctant gun dealers to make the sales .The straw purchasers were not followed by close physical surveillance ; they were freely permitted to bulk transfer the guns to , among others , Mexican drug gangs and other violent criminals - with no agents on hand to swoop in , make arrests , and grab the firearms .The inevitable result of this was that the guns have been used ( and will continue to be used ) in many crimes , including the murder of Brian Terry , a U.S. border patrol agent .That is not law enforcement ; that is abetting a criminal rampage .Another crucial distinction : The Bush - era gun tracing program known as \" Wide Receiver \" was executed in concert with the Mexican government , which was fully involved at every step of the process . \"Fast & Furious \" was conceived and launched without the knowledge of the Mexican government - and its citizens have paid a very dear price as a result .Even Holder himself has acknowledged that Fast & Furious was entirely an Obama - era endeavor : .It should be fully understood , that unlike the Bush program , the Obama regime embarked on this criminal enterprise without notifying the Mexican government .The regime made absolutely no attempt to track any of these guns from the point of sale to the violent criminals whose hands they ended up in .There 's a reason for this , something we 've mentioned before .This was n't about tracking guns and arresting criminals .Marxists like Obama and Holder [ and liberals in general ] have long dreamed about disarming the American people .They understand the only way to fully enslave a people is to disarm them .Not only did the regime anticipate the mass murders that have occurred , it needed them to happen for their dastardly plan to work .They needed people to die so they could sell their gun grabbing plan to the public .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"98.30922"}
