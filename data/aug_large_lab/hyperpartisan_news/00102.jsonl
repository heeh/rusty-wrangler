{"text":"Mercury .Estimated Population At Risk At Identified Sites : . 8.6 Million People .Estimated Global Impact : . 15 to 19 Million People .Introduction .Mercury is a heavy metal that has significant impacts on human health .Mercury comes in three forms- metallic , inorganic , and organic - each with its own degree of toxicity and particular exposure pathways .Metallic mercury is the pure elemental form of the metal , and is extracted from cinnabar ore .Another primary form of the metal is organic mercury , most commonly known as methylmercury , and produced when elemental mercury combines with carbon .This is the form of the pollutant that can contaminate food chains .Mercury naturally enters the environment through the breakdown of minerals into soil , which is then dispersed through the movement of air and water .Since the start of the industrial revolution in the 18th century , the release of mercury into the environment has been heavily amplified .Currently , the anthropogenic release of mercury accounts for up to two - thirds of the total mercury in the environment .[ 24 ] .Other common sources of mercury pollution in these countries include industrial mining , chemical manufacturing , solid waste disposal , and metals smelting .Most of these activities involve the heating of mercury , which releases it into the air in vapor form .The mercury is then transported in dust by wind .Mercury can settle into soil or surface waters through rainfall , and often is washed away from these sites along with tailings and sediments into local water bodies .Once in an aquatic ecosystem , elemental mercury can be transformed into methylmercury - a powerful neurotoxin - by bacteria , and can bioaccumulate and move up the food chain .People are commonly exposed to mercury through the inhalation of vapors produced through the burning of mercury in these various industrial activities ; however , many are also exposed to methylmercury through the consumption of contaminated food products such as fish .Once mercury enters the human body , it can permanently damage the brain , kidneys , and the development of a fetus .Exposure to methylmercury can cause arthritis , miscarriages , respiratory failure , neurological damage , and even death .Children are most at risk of mercury exposure , especially in regions adjacent to small- and large - scale gold mines .Common Exposure Pathways and Health Risks .Mercury is released into the environment both as a vapor from burning processes and as a liquid that contaminates water and soil .In occupational settings such as mining sites , workers are primarily exposed to elemental mercury in the form of these vapors - it is estimated that around 80 % of exposure to mercury is through this pathway .[ 25 ] People are also exposed to mercury through dermal contact , as the contaminant can be absorbed through the skin .The use of mercury in industrial processes and products also allows small amounts of the heavy metal to contaminate soils and local water bodies .One study of small - scale mining in Peru estimated that one or two grams of mercury were being released into the surrounding environment for every gram of gold produced .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"50.789547"}

{"text":"While this will precipitate some price spikes , the price sensitivity to increased costs of , for example , the actual use of europium in liquid crystal displays is miniscule and the rare earths therefore remain relatively price- insensitive commodities .It is highly unlikely that that the Chinese dependence on imports supplied by both major and small mining companies for their supply of copper , iron ore , or phosphates and potash will diminish substantially in the near future .The prospects for growth in Chinese demand are much more likely .Of the enormous amounts of metals and minerals produced , copper and iron ore alone represent roughly half of the total value created in global metal mining .Chinese iron ore imports amount to over 500 Mt conservatively valued at US$ 50 billion .But there are also other strategic metals such as phosphates and potash which are crucial for the production of fertilizers and hence for Chinese food supplies and which also need to be taken into consideration in this import dependence scenario .The situation where China is dependent on a limited number of major transnational mining companies will therefore continue to be a much more serious risk for international conflicts in the future than the supply of rare earths .It is also important to appreciate as well that North America , Australia , and Europe have their own interests to protect in Africa and Latin America , and much of the anti - Chinese sentiment is driven by these factors .These countries have enjoyed more - or - less unfettered dominance of the African minerals sector for the most part of the 20th century in sourcing cheap raw materials , so the resistance to Chinese competition from these quarters is understandable .However , from the African experience of Chinese mining investments to date , it is clear that there is a dire need for efficient resource administration in order to manage Chinese investment effectively .In South Africa , for example , Chinese investors are aware of this and have been watching regulatory developments with a great deal of interest and concern .Consequently , there is a tendency for Chinese investors to seek control of their investments in the African mining sector .In conclusion , there are many misconceptions concerning the Chinese imperative to ensure security of supply for resources and hence its interest in African resources .It is , however , of major concern for China that it is not to be able to secure its supply of most of the economically important metals and minerals in the way the ' Western ' countries have been able to do for decades .This said , the perceived threat of China to the ' Western ' interests must be seen in its true context .The attempts by the Chinese to invest in new projects or to take control over established transnational mining companies have evoked strong but unjustified political concern in Australia , Canada , and elsewhere that is essence not supported by global production statistics .While these misconceptions are widespread and more often than not unsubstantiated , they are exacerbated by the lack of clear and transparent statistics from China itself .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"57.502533"}

{"text":"In Deer Trail , Colo. , citizens will vote this fall on an ordinance that would grant people licenses to shoot down drones .( The ordinance is largely symbolic , as the FAA has asserted that taking potshots at unmanned aircraft would be illegal . )Commercial drone trials are already proceeding in Canada .In Edmonton , Alberta , Stantec , a consulting company that uses aerial photography in its design and mapping business , recently bought a drone made by senseFly and has been training with it this past winter and spring .Stantec is seeking certification and licensing for commercial use from the Canadian government .Curt Chapman , a company vice president based in Reno , Nev. , says he expects that it will soon be approved for low - altitude photography on a project - by - project basis , rather than being granted a blanket license .The drone 's advantage , he said , is that it is handy for immediate use .\" We can take it out , fly it and capture conditions \" such as flooding , he said .\" It may take days or weeks to schedule the same flight on a manned vehicle .\" Companies in the United States are preparing for drones , too .Woolpert owns six traditional , piloted twin - engine aircraft to collect data for aerial mapping ; these typically cost $ 2 million to $ 3 million to buy and several thousand dollars an hour to operate , he said .Gavin Schrock , a professional surveyor and associate editor of Professional Surveyor magazine , says he thinks that surveyors will be among the first to add drones to their tool kits .Aerial systems are perfect for surveying locations like open - pit mines , he said .A small drone can fly over a pit , shuttling back and forth in overlapping rows , taking pictures that can be stitched together and converted into a three - dimensional model that is accurate to within a few inches .Such a system is safer than having a surveyor walk around the pit with traditional tools .\" I hate doing that , \" Schrock said .\" It 's dangerous .\" Trimble , a company in Sunnyvale , Calif. , that sells mapping and other equipment , introduced in June a 5.5-pound drone called the UX5 , said Rob Miller , who oversees the product line , which also includes another drone , the X100 .The systems cost $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 , depending on the model and software .They are being used abroad to track changes at mining , construction and agricultural sites .But before drones take up these and other jobs in the United States , the surveillance issues are hovering .\" We need to put in place good privacy protection , \" Stanley of the ACLU said , \" so that people can innovate around this technology without the cloud of Big Brother hanging over them . \" Before long , drones will be flying across the nation 's skies , part of the way companies do business every day .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.48451"}
{"text":"The Federal Government through the Australian Geological Survey Organisation , is charged with the responsibility for the effective storage , care and distribution of the offshore data from Commonwealth waters .The Australian manufacturing industry , despite its growth , absorbed only a small part of the greatly increased mineral production , and the proportion of production exported ( in either raw or processed form ) increased greatly after the 1960s .In 1969 - 70 , the value of mineral and petroleum products exported represented 27 % of the total value of Australian goods and services exported .By 1989 - 90 , the value of mineral and petroleum products exported represented 27 % of the total value of Australian goods and services exported ; this percentage had climbed to 41 % , before declining to 35 % in 1998 - 99 .Mineral exports have relieved the pressure on the Australian balance of payments , but also made the industry very dependent on the health of the world economy .The destination of exports changed between 1965 and the end of the century , reflecting our location within the Asian region .In 1965 , 41 % of Australia 's mineral exports went to Europe ( and 24 % of total exports were to the United Kingdom ) ; 41 % went to Asia ( 32 % of the total going to Japan ) ; and 16 % went to America .Not surprisingly , the mineral deposits found in the first century of mineral search were those well exposed at the surface ; and the first petroleum accumulations found tended to be the larger , more easily delineated , ones .Consequently , finding further economic ore bodies and petroleum accumulations has become progressively more difficult , requiring the use of increased skills in applying suitable methods and interpreting the results .Notwithstanding this , discoveries have continued apace and , over the last 50 years , Australia has developed into one of the world 's leading mining nations .The mining industry has created wealth for the nation and its people through the discovery and mining of mineral deposits and processing the ore .It mines , or has unworked deposits of , almost all mineral commodities .Australia is one of the world 's leading miners of bauxite , diamonds , gold , iron ore , lead , manganese ore , nickel , titanium ( rutile and ilmenite ) , zinc and zircon .The annual value of production for individual commodities is of the order of $ 9 billion in the case of coal and petroleum , and $ 4 billion in the case of gold , iron ore and bauxite .Some commodities , such as petroleum , nickel , bauxite , diamonds and uranium have had a relatively short production history in Australia ; others , such as gold , coal , base metals and iron ore go back to the early days of the industry .Despite its importance as a mineral producer , Australia remains under - explored over vast regions .For metals , this is the case at depths of greater than a hundred metres or so in established mineral provinces , and under the covered margins of these provinces .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"75.501175"}

{"text":"What makes gold so valuable ?I recently did some research on gold as part of a commodities study .Did you know that gold is mostly used as a measure of wealth ?According to The U.S. Geologic Survey almost ninety percent of gold production is used to make either jewelry or gold ingots that sit in vaults .Much of the jewelry is used as savings by people in the developing world .In fact , so little gold is used in industrial applications that recycled broken jewelry could easily cover all industrial demand .And even if everyone stopped selling their scrap gold , there are good substitutes for all of gold 's industrial uses .So what is it about gold that makes it so valuable ?It does not provide food , shelter , or clothing , and its industrial uses can all be covered by other substances .When I ask that question people start waxing philosophical about intrinsic value .After all , they remind me , the market sets the price , and everyone knows what it is worth .Only one person , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , has been candid enough to call it what it is .When asked why the United States holds gold reserves he responded \" Well , it 's tradition - long - term tradition .\" When one considers how limited the truly productive uses for gold are , it becomes apparent that gold is wildly overvalued .And yet the price of gold does not nearly reflect its true cost .The best way to understand the cost of gold is to examine gold mining .There are several methods commonly used for mining gold and all of them are very hard on the environment .Most gold \" mining \" these days is done using a process called heap leaching .In heap leaching hundreds of thousands of tons of rock are ground into a fine powder .Bulldozers are then used to pile the powder on top of a plastic liner where it is sprayed with a cyanide solution .The solution is left to leach its way through the pile , after which it is filtered to collect the gold .Heap leaching is done out in the open and accidents do happen .Plastic liners fail under the stress of bulldozer traffic .When the liners hold up , heavy rain often exceeds the capacity of the liner and cyanide solution is released .There have been numerous incidents where cyanide was released into rivers killing fish and poisoning drinking water .Another problem is that tailings - the piles of powdered rock remaining after leaching - sometimes collapse fouling nearby rivers into which they spill .In one incident , a tailings dam in Baia Mare , Romania collapsed , causing extensive damage to over 1,000 kilometers of river ecosystem .In the Amazon , artisanal miners spend their days shoveling mud into mercury - coated chutes , where minute flakes of gold are absorbed by the mercury , forming a paste .These \" artisans \" then evaporate the mercury with a blow torch to separate the gold , poisoning themselves in the process .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"76.04895"}

{"text":"Owen Mike , who 's in line to succeed his 90-year - old father , Thomas , as head of the Ho - Chunk ( Winnebago ) buffalo clan , says his people have a slightly different interpretation of the white calf 's significance .He adds , however , that the Ho - Chunk version of the prophecy also stresses the return of harmony , both in nature and among all peoples .Despite her enormous spiritual and cultural significance , Miracle is n't scientifically important .UW - Madison geneticist Dr. Richard Spritz , an expert in albinism and other pigmentation disorders , disputes news reports that the odds of a white buffalo being born are less than one in 10 million . \" In humans , the frequency of albinism in most populations is about one in 15,000 , which turns out to be a pretty handy number for buffalo because the estimated number of them in the U.S. is something around 150,000 .That means , that any given time , if the frequency of albinism in buffalo is similar to that in humans , there ought to be 10 white buffalo out there .And if there 's some other way to have a white buffalo , there ought to be more . \"So while the American Bison Association says the last documented white buffalo died in 1959 , Spritz says the person who alerted him to Miracle 's birth has tracked down six living white buffalo .He also notes that a stuffed white buffalo has stood in Harvard 's Peabody Museum for years .( There 's always some question whether a white buffalo is actually part cow , and therefore a beefalo .Dave Heider says he will allow Miracle 's DNA to be examined in March , when it 's time for her to be inoculated against various diseases . )But even if other white buffalo have been born in modern times , Miracle holds special significance for Native Americans .She 's female , and the bull that sired her died , just as in the prophesy .Joseph Chasing Horse , in a phone interview from his home in Rapid City , S.D. , adds that winter counts -- which date the telling of the White Buffalo Calf Woman story in sacred ceremonies -- confirm that this is the buffalo calf of the prophesy .Moreover , the birth of Miracle on the Heider farm coincides with increased economic stability ( thanks in large part to profits from Indian gaming ) and cultural rejuvenation among Native Americans .For example , the Ho - Chunk ( who this month received federal permission to restore their original name ) have used gaming profits to establish Ho - Chunk language programs in their summer camp for teenage children and in four new Head Start centers .The tribe has also reacquired a tract of land that includes sacred sites on the lower Wisconsin River .\" They tried to beat the Indian out of us .It 's imperative that we go back to these stories and find out what they mean to us ... and who we are . \"","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"88.530136"}

{"text":"But Looking Horse 's life changed dramatically when a white bison calf was born in Janesville , Wisconsin , on Aug. 20 , 1994 , on a tiny hobby farm in an area known as a hotbed of white supremacist activity .A short feature story was picked up by the Associated Press , and the news eventually reached Looking Horse .This calf , Looking Horse determined - like three more that followed within the next three years - fulfilled the legend .While other white bison have been born , and their births considered holy and rare , these four were special .They were all female - like the spirit woman - and none were albino .Instead , they were born with dark eyes and muzzles and subsequently changed colors , just as the calf woman had as she left .While most bison calves were born in spring , these four all came in late summer - around the time the calf woman first visited the tribe .With the help of sacred ceremonies , Looking Horse determined these to be the signs the tribe had been waiting for , culminating with that July 1997 birth of No . 19 ( also called White Medicine ) on the Romaniks ' Michigan ranch . \"And now the stories of prophecy become reality , \" Arvol says .\" We 're right in the middle of these crossroads . \"Looking Horse is n't wasting any time .The Lakota chief has learned English , bought himself not only a telephone but also his own Web site , and become a sought - after participant in world peace events .This past summer , he served as delegate to a United Nations conference for world spiritual leaders .He has met with such leaders as South Africa 's Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama , and is focusing on creating a new international day of peace and prayer .Each June 21 , he says , he wants everyone in the world to pray together for peace - from whatever place they consider most holy .Meanwhile , reports of new white bison births keep flowing in - from one in Ohio this past summer to another in South Africa , where a water buffalo was born white .To him , it 's all a sign that conditions in the world are \" great urgent , \" and that we 're not responding quickly enough .\" Either we unite spiritually with many nations of the world , \" he says , \" or be faced with a lot of sickness and tears from a relative 's eyes . \"With bison ranchers now raising hundreds of thousands of bison across North America , it 's tempting to dismiss the white bison births as a logical outcome of bigger herds : The more buffalo we have , the more likely the chances of genetic variation .So are we seeing a miracle or just a statistical result ?Perhaps a little of both , concludes anthropologist Robert Pickering in his book , Seeing the White Buffalo .When a white calf was born on the Janesville farm of Dave and Val Heider in 1994 , such a birth was so unusual that even its rural white owners named her \" Miracle . \" In the earlier part of the century , there were at most a handful of known births of white bison - the most recent in Alaska in the 1950s .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"122.47322"}
