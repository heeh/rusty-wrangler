{"text":"Is it true that there are bills in the House and Senate that will exempt members and their staff and families from buying into Obamacare ? FULL ANSWER .Several readers have asked us about Congress attempting to exempt itself from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act .A few said that a Facebook post claimed that President Barack Obama , Sen. Harry Reid and Democrats in Congress were trying to \" get themselves exempted from Obamacare , \" in the words of one reader .But there is no bill in Congress calling for an exemption from the health care law .In fact , members of Congress and their staffs face additional requirements that most Americans do n't have to meet .Under the health care law , their insurance coverage will have to switch from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program , the group of private insurance plans that cover 8 million federal employees and retirees , to the exchanges created by the law .Those exchanges are meant for those who buy coverage on their own , the currently uninsured and small businesses .Members of Congress and their staffs would be the only employees of a large employer in the exchanges , which are set to begin offering insurance in January .So , why is the false \" exempt \" claim making the Facebook rounds ?There is reportedly concern on Capitol Hill that the Office of Personnel Management , which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program , wo n't be able to smoothly transition members and their staffs into an exchange .The concern , as a Roll Call story explained , was that the government would n't be able to make contributions toward the federal employees ' premiums , at least at the beginning of 2014 .That would mean employees would pick up the whole tab for their insurance policies .Right now , the government pays 72 percent of premiums on average .The \" exempt \" claims were sparked by a Politico report on April 24 that said secret talks were being held by lawmakers to change the requirement to get insurance through the exchanges because of this concern .The headline on the story said \" Lawmakers , aides may get Obamacare exemption . \"After the story was published , a spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid said there had n't been any discussions to exempt Congress from \" provisions that apply to any employees of any other public or private employer offering health care . \"And Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California told Politico that lawmakers and their staffs will indeed get insurance through the exchanges .\" [ T]he federal government will offer them health insurance coverage that they obtained through the exchanges because we want to get the same health care coverage everybody else has available to them , \" he said .We contacted the Office of Personnel Management and received this statement from an administration official : \" Members of Congress will not receive anything that is not available to the public .The law does n't allow them to get insurance from FEHB , they are going to get insurance on the market place , just like uninsured individuals and small businesses .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"31.91697"}
{"text":"The decision by the Office of Personnel Management , with Obama 's blessing , will prevent the largely unintended loss of healthcare benefits for 535 members of the Senate and House of Representatives and thousands of Capitol Hill staff .When Congress passed the health reform law known as Obamacare in 2010 , an amendment required that lawmakers and their staff members purchase health insurance through the online exchanges that the law created .They would lose generous coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program .The amendment 's author , Republican Senator Charles Grassley , argued that if Obamacare plans were good enough for the American public , they were good enough for Congress .Democrats , eager to pass the reforms , went along with it .But it soon became apparent the provision contained no language that allowed federal contributions toward their health plans that cover about 75 percent of the premium costs .This caused fears that staff would suddenly face sharply higher healthcare costs and leave federal service , causing a \" brain drain \" on Capitol Hill .But Wednesday 's proposed rule from the OPM , the federal government 's human resources agency , means that Congress will escape the most onerous impact of law as it was written .The OPM said the federal contributions will be allowed to continue for exchange - purchased plans for lawmakers and their staffs , ensuring that those working on Capitol Hill will effectively get the same health contributions as millions of other federal workers who keep their current plan .The problem surrounding the Obamacare language for Capitol Hill staff was the subject of intense negotiations in recent weeks between House and Senate leaders and the Obama administration .Some Republicans immediately slammed the OPM decision , using it as fuel for their campaign to turn public opinion against Obamacare just as its core provisions are due to go into effect .\" While the administration has handed out waiver after waiver and exemption after exemption for the well - connected in Washington , they have done nothing to lower health care costs for families in Michigan , \" said Dave Camp , chairman of the tax - writing House Ways and Means Committee .Camp said the OPM ruling is the \" latest proof \" of impending failure for the reforms and pledged that Republicans would keep trying to repeal them .Last week , House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the language problem would have caused unintended \" collateral damage \" on congressional staff , causing many to leave for the private sector .\" They are a tremendous intellectual resource , people who could , shall we say , be better compensated financially outside \" of government , said Pelosi , who spearheaded passage of the health care law in 2010 as House Speaker .STILL MUST PURCHASE PLANS .Lawmakers and staff still must purchase plans on the exchanges for coverage that starts in January , OPM said , and they will not be eligible for tax credits to offset premium payments .These credits are the main federal subsidy mechanism for all other health plans purchased through Obamacare exchanges due to open in October .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"32.10372"}

{"text":"Subsidizing health insurance and expanding eligibility for Medicaid coverage through the Affordable Care Act led to the biggest drop in the uninsured rate since the creation of Medicaid and Medicare themselves .Even though more than 10 million people bought private coverage via a health insurance exchange and millions more have gained Medicaid benefits , enrollment data from this year show that the pace was slower than during the first sign - up period .That makes sense , because the uninsured people who were most eager for coverage , as well as the people who could get the lowest - cost insurance , enrolled as soon as they could .Just 36 percent of the people who could be enrolled in an exchange plan actually are , according to a Henry J.
