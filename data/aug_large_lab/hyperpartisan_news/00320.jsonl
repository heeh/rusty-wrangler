{"text":"The White House continues to deny they changed the language in those talking points away from the probability that it was a terrorist attack .Obviously , they ca n't both be telling the truth .One week earlier , Petraeus resigned as the Director of the CIA in light of an FBI investigation of Petraeus involving an affair with his 40-year - old biographer Paula Broadwell .The investigation into Petraeus began earlier in the summer and the FBI determined fairly quickly , by late summer at the latest , that the affair did not create a security breach .Absent a security breach , the FBI argued last week that it was appropriate not to notify Congress or the White House earlier .According to the White House , it was n't informed of the FBI investigation that involved Petraeus until Election Day , Nov. 6 .The very fact that the White House was kept out of the loop has caused the appearance of a cover up by the Justice Department , timing the release of the information to the White House until after the election .The concern has more to do with Petraeus ' role in the investigation of the Benghazi attack than any concerns over the propinquitous relationship between the general and his now infamous biographer .There has emerged over the past week a difference in the story between Petraeus and the Obama White House over who characterized the Benghazi attack as a spontaneous protest which got out of hand .The White House has argued all along that they were not intentionally misleading the American people .If the testimony of General Petraeus is to be believed , it would appear that the Obama administration , on their own , made a deliberate decision to state and restate the claim that the attack was spontaneous and grew out of a demonstration against an anti - Islam video .This claim was made by the President , the Secretary of State and UN Ambassador Susan Rice .If the claim is proven false , some believe the Obama Administration wanted at all costs to avoid a narrative that undermined their foreign policy claims , and an al - Qaida attack on Benghazi would have been damaging to the President 's re - election chances .Other observers argue that there is no evidence Petraeus was pushed out because of his role in the Benghazi response .The fact that he resigned right after the election and right before another closed - door Benghazi hearing is simply a coincidence .Since there was no evidence of a security breach and simply an affair , those observers argue the FBI was correct in not informing the President earlier .Forum Question of the Week : .Should the FBI have reported to President Obama once General Petraeus became the target of their investigation ?Is the Petraeus scandal in the news now simply because it was being conveniently delayed until after the election ?Scandal : If it ai n't there , fabricate it !By Marianne Stanley .AUGH !Once again , we have a trumped up story about nefarious and imaginary shenanigans by the Obama administration .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"61.374092"}

Rossotti eventually replaced Hillary Clinton friend Margaret Milner Richardson as IRS Commissioner in 1997 .Things did not change at the IRS .And then Rossotti was also caught red - handed in illegal conflicts of interest .Rossotti , as IRS commissioner , has overseen the awarding of IRS contracts to AMS , a company which he founded and in which he still has a major financial interest .This year alone , AMS reportedly will make at least $ 17 million from its IRS contracts .Additionally , his wife served as outside counsel for AMS .All these scandals did not seem to bother the Bush Administration .Rossotti remains as IRS commissioner .In December 2001 , Rossotti was forced to sell his interest in AMS .This came only after Judicial Watch criminal and civil actions concerning his conflict of interest .The sale of stock was also shortly after Judicial Watch sent 26,103 petitions to President Bush demanding that he fire Rossotti .FBI Director Louis Freeh .In addition , Freeh tried to silence whistleblowers like Notra Trulock , who revealed the huge breach of national security at Los Alamos National Laboratory .All this information on Freeh was before President Bush and his advisors when he made the decision to keep Freeh as FBI Director .Freeh resigned mid - last year , reportedly so that he could make more money .He clearly deserved to be fired and prosecuted for his role in the many FBI scandals .VII .LITTLE CHANGE AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT .Given the corruption of the previous Justice Department , the Attorney General had much to do restore trust in once revered Department .Judicial Watch looked forward to working with the new Attorney General and unsuccessfully sought meetings with him to offer its help in cleaning up government corruption .Unfortunately , over the past year , Judicial Watch has not seen any change in the legal stance of the Justice Department with regard to any of its ongoing cases concerning Clinton corruption .Politics & Fundraising As Usual .Judicial Watch could not get a meeting with the Attorney General , but Republican donors could .President Bush has stated publically that the Holy Land Foundation launders money for the Hamas terrorist organization and has directly financed the murder of American citizens .How is it that the legal counsel for a terrorist front organization enjoys such ready access to the Attorney General and his staff ?The Privacy Act .The Privacy Act was passed in response to the abuses of the Nixon era and was designed to keep the government from illegally maintaining , disseminating , or using government files on American citizens .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.283485"}
