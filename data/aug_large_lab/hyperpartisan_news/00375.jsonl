Ted Cruz .While taking questions from the audience a young Latina stood up to ask him about his policy on immigration .She said that she was \" worried about whoever comes next to the presidency and what 's going to happen to people like us .\" It was a heartfelt plea for understanding from someone who was clearly concerned about whether she would be able to remain in the country she loved and in which she was raised .Cruz adopted a mock compassionate tone while telling her that , if he becomes president , she will very likely be deported as a criminal because \" violating the laws has consequences .\" It should be noted that this woman broke no laws .She was brought to the U.S. as a child by her parents and has distinguished herself by finishing school and working for a non - profit that assists children with special needs .She was even praised by GOP Rep. Steve King , a notoriously anti - immigrant Tea Party Republican who just happened to have met her previously and was impressed .Once again , this story found a home at Fox Nation where they plastered on a headline reading \" DNC DREAMer Plant Tries To Ambush Ted Cruz And It Backfires Miserably .\" This article was sourced to something called Red Alert Politics and alleged that ... .\"The Democratic National Committee tried to entrap Cruz at a campaign event in Storm Lake , Iowa yesterday by having an illegal immigrant DREAMer named Ofelia Valdez confront the Texas senator .\" There was no evidence in the article that tied the woman to the Democratic National Committee .Apparently , just the fact that she asked a question that was less than a sycophantic exercise in kissing up to Cruz was enough to label her a plant .The reality that there are millions of people just like her is n't sufficient to presume that she is merely a sincere constituent who is genuinely concerned about her future .This paranoid behavior is nothing new for the right - wing press .Last September at a Trump rally , a man rose to complain about what he called \" the Muslim problem \" and asked \" When can we get rid of them ?\" That led to an article in the ultra - conservative Daily Caller that baselessly alleged that the questioner was a plant .And the intrepid pseudo - journalists over at Breitbart News went even further to claim that they had found proof that consisted of a photo that was plainly somebody else entirely .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"85.18944"}
