{"text":"From that time Ana Luisa Cid transformed herself in an all time debunker for every case , witness or evidence related with Jaime Maussan only as revenge due to a frustration for being banned .Recently Ana Luisa Cid made partnership with an unknown individual named Humberto Villafuerte who writes under the pseudonym tachiblog and who is also an enemy of Jaime Maussan .This couple Ana Luis Cid and tachiblog Humberto Villafuerte decided to debunk the Maurucio Ryuiz / Alvin Texas in retaliation for not giving them his story and also because Maussan is invloved .These are undeniable facts and can be proved anytime if required .I received every detail and evidence of the failed hoax perpetrated by this couple Cid / tachiblog from the Jaime Maussan 's office wich I thank them and that 's how I knew all about this outrageous debunk attempt .The Jaime Maussan 's office was kind enough to send me every episode of their tv show with their investigation on the case including the recent exposure of the failed hoax by this couple , a demolishing exposé .This is the real story behind the debunk attempt by Cid and tachiblog internos , the real motives merely personal .You asked me about facts and I 'm giving you these facts from my own private research .I think it 's important to know all the issues on this case not only the video itself but how this incident happened , who is really the witness and what were the consequences registered in that place .There 's been many hours spent in this investigation and the results have been presented only in Mexico but very soon the story will be released by the american media .In my own private research I 'm satisfied of the data gathered after many emails and phone calls .At this moment my conclusion is that the state of Texas is experiencing an intense Ufo wave of sightings that attracted the attention of people and media .This Ufo activity is real and ongoing and we as researchers must insist to all those witnesses videotaping or photographing Ufos please come forward , share your evidences , tell your stories .Times are changing .Why is every thread you write a mile long spirit ... do you really care that much ?He presented a news story and said he believes it , you do n't have to make it personal .Present the facts in a calm way that does n't portray you as attacking internos .Chill pill , please .About the original footage you metioned a name Jeff Ritzmann ?Who is he ?Where does he live and what are his credentials cause I do n't remember hearing about him .Is Mr. Ritzmann reliable ?Is he a researcher or a skeptic ?Maybe you could give me more info about Mr. Ritzmann .Anyway i have to be clear on this internos .First I 'm not in charge or involved in any way on this investigation regarding the Alvin Texas / Mauricio Ruiz Ufo case .I knew about this story when it was released on Youtube and discussed here on ATS in April .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"101.68557"}
{"text":"Packers player admits sexual contact , claims there was consent .The still - unnamed member of the Green Bay Packers who is under investigation for sexual assault reportedly has admitted having sexual contact with the alleged victims .( Yes , victims . )However , the player claims that the contact with the two women was consensual , according to Charles Davis of the Green Bay Press - Gazette .The women claim there was no consent .The women also initially claimed that more than one player was involved .Police interviewed seven Packers ; six of them are not suspected of criminal misconduct .The unnamed player becomes the third NFL player accused of sexual assault in less than a year .Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has faced two such claims .A civil suit filed earlier this year alleges that Colts defensive tackle Eric Foster sexually assaulted a hotel worker on the morning of the AFC Championship in January .Though the six - game suspension imposed on Roethlisberger likely will trigger speculation that the unnamed Packer will face similar treatment even without an arrest , keep in mind that the league looks to pounce preemptively only on repeat offenders .\" I 'm not going to wait for somebody to get thrown into jail .\" In this case , the unnamed Packer could get thrown in jail .But the league most likely wo n't intervene until the matter is resolved , unless the player in question has prior issues under the Personal Conduct Policy .The last thing i wanna do is stick up for a Packer , but anyone with good sense will be skeptical of this .I do n't want to downplay a sexual assault , but if the officers thought there was qaulity merit to this story , the player would n't have been released .( unless it was aaron rodgers ) .Dammit !Come on you dumb ass players !I do n't care what team you are on , get your heads out of your asses and THINK for a change .For their whole life no one said no to them .Teachers in high school gave them good grades so they could keep playing .In college they kept getting good grades and ' agents ' started showing up leaving games consols behind in their dorms ( just what I heard from a co - worker that had his brother drafted a few years ago ) .THESE PLAYERS ARE SPOILED AND DUMB .OK , not all .But you get my idea .I predict a lot of Vikings fans to do their best Jimmy Smith and Bob Nelson impersonations in this thread , and rightfully so ... the anti - Vikes crowd here has it coming .Who wants to root for a team that does n't rein in their players and impose moral discipline on them ?I 'm willing to bet the player is unnamed because it 's a high profile Packer .When will the NFL wise up and shut down the Green Bay Packers who clearly are harboring known criminals .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"102.8703"}
{"text":"Thanks for writing another insightful post .Thanks for the kind words !I was thinking more in terms of fan perception but you 're quite right about Jones drawing the same wrong conclusions ..... to the detriment of his health .It kind of proves that a fighter 's capacity for self - deception is right up there with that of their hard - core fans .It reminds me of when the hard - core Ali fans swore up and down that Ali was going to beat Holmes ..... and I think Ali believed it too .You can fool yourself , you can fool your fans , but you ca n't fool Father Time ..... he ai n't buying it .It kind of proves that a fighter 's capacity for self - deception is right up there with that of their hard - core fans .It reminds me of when the hard - core Ali fans swore up and down that Ali was going to beat Holmes ..... and I think Ali believed it too .You can fool yourself , you can fool your fans , but you ca n't fool Father Time ..... he ai n't buying it .I hate to admit this publically , but I got ta tell the truth .When Ali fought Holmes , my head says Holmes has an easy night because Ali was so advanced in age & his skills were so degraded .But in my heart , I wanted Ali to pull out yet another miracle .Nothing against Larry , I actually liked him a lot .But come on , this was Muhammad Ali !We grew up watching him beat Frazier , Norton , Foreman .You could never bet against him .Instead , it just got worse .The great Muhammad Ali was empty .When it 's gone , it 's gone .Yeah .It would be like Michael Spinks moving up and lifting a belt from Trevor Berbeck rather than Larry Holmes .Everyone would be saying \" So fvcking what ?It 's Trevor Berbeck . \"Same thing with Ruiz .It does n't hurt Jones but it does n't do a damn thing for his legacy either .Did anyone have any doubts Jones would beat Ruiz ?I sure as hell did n't and I expected it to be easy and it was : It was John Fvcking Ruiz ffs .It does n't matter who I think will win ...You still get credit for it .I think Floyd is going to dominate Pac ... just because I think that , when he does it .Same thing with Ortiz ...Floyds gon na cruise in that fight ... he still gets credit .Sure , Ruiz was a title holder ...Roy was also a LHW , who came from MW . and was still outweighed by 30lbs on fight night .It 's not JUST who he faced , but him coming from MW to do it .How the hell does winning easily against a fighter you 're EXPECTED to win against easily enhance your legacy ?","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"106.80995"}
