Kelley , the chief deputy attorney general , was yes .Kelley noted that the Obama administration did not change the unlawful status of illegal immigrants when it granted a two - year reprieve from deportation to participants in the DACA program .Kelley added that his opinion should not be construed as altering that finding .Robertson , an appointee of former Gov.
