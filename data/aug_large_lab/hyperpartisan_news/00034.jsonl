Bush had addressed the issue , and had signed into law 700 miles of double layer fencing , but one of his own added an amendment and the whole construction fell through .Any of them can pledge their bond , but once they gain the power by their own hand , it drops away and the whole bill ends up in some basement file cabinet , never to see the light of day .When the Supreme Court proclaimed that it would hear the Texas - led , 26-state dispute to President Obama 's delayed action , I was investigating the mainstream press cover - up task in keeping most Americans in the dark concerning unchecked immigration 's with unintended significance .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"73.77689"}
