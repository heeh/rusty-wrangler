{"text":"It 's the kind of meeting educators hate : a hundred angry parents packed into a stuffy school auditorium and squeezed into seats built for third - graders .This is Park Slope , Brooklyn , an enclave of urban , liberal - leaning professionals who push their babies around in $ 800 strollers while pondering whether or not the new artificial grass in the park will give their kids cancer .These parents obsess over every detail of their children 's lives - especially their education .Polakow - Suransky is leading the drive to develop a better way to judge a school 's success .Shael Polakow - Suransky ' 94 , the chief academic officer and senior deputy chancellor of New York City 's school system , stands before them , ready to receive their ire .He has taken off the jacket of his pin - striped suit and rolled up the sleeves of his well - pressed white shirt .With his balding head , modish eyeglasses , and thoughtful and sympathetic air , he looks exactly like the school principal he used to be .Although chairs and a table have been placed on the stage for his use , he has chosen to stand on the auditorium floor , placing him at the same level as the assembled parents .\" How can you use a tool to evaluate my child that has no validity ? \" one of them asks .She is referring to the annual standardized tests the city uses to assess student performance , tests that are dreaded and loathed in Brooklyn at least as much as they are in the rest of the country .Parents everywhere complain they are a one - size - fits - all assessment that measures a student 's ability by how well he or she answers multiple - choice questions . \" As a taxpayer , \" one mother says at the meeting , \" they make me want to get violent .\" Through it all , Polakow - Suransky remains calm and collected .The exams are by no means perfect , he says , but at the moment they are the best way the city has of ensuring that its schools offer a fundamentally sound education .Whereas schools were once evaluated solely on whether or not they taught the curriculum , they are now judged on how well they teach it .\" We do n't yet really have a strong , robust evaluation system , \" he concedes .But \" at this moment in time they are the only tests available . \"Shael Polakow - Suransky wants to change that .Long a champion of progressive education , he 's an outsider turned insider , a revolutionary become reformer .In the schools where he 's worked - the Crossroads Middle School and Bread and Roses Integrated Arts High School in upper Manhattan and the Bronx International High School - students called their teachers by their first names and received lengthy written evaluations instead of graded report cards .Yet here he is , the second - in - command of a school system that measures the success of its students with a standardized multiple - choice exam .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"88.20183"}
{"text":"The coded language , Polakow - Suransky writes , was a clear reference to nuclear warheads .Some critics have questioned this certainty .Peres denies Israel made the offer .And Polakow - Suransky himself said , \" The deal never came to fruition .\" But more important , he added , \" There are a lot of others that did . \"Supported by documents in his book , he said , \" These guys were building missiles together and testing them off the coast of South Africa throughout the 1980s .The transfer that did n't happen in 1975 turned into a joint research and development project in South Africa for 15 years .\" Polakow - Suransky 's book also reveals that for many years South Africa supplied uranium to fuel Israel 's Dimona nuclear reactor .For many , this was the unsentimental relationship of two states that turned to each other as each grappled with their pariah status in other parts of the world .But Polakow - Suransky says their relationship went beyond realpolitik .For at least some on the Israeli side , he said , it became a bond of two allies who understood and sympathized with each other 's existential struggles .He sees similarities between Afrikanner nationalism and the revisionist Zionism of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and his ideological heirs .Polakow - Suranksy singles out comments made by right - wing Israeli figures such as Ariel Sharon , Gen. Rafael Eitan and Revisionist leader Eliahu Lenkin that crossed a line into what he calls \" ideological affinity . \"In December 1987 , for example , Eitan , by then a national political leader , told an audience at Tel Aviv University that South African blacks \" want to gain control over the white minority , just like the Arabs here want to gain conrol over us .And we , too , like the white minority in South Africa , must act to prevent them from taking over . \"\" There is a difference between saying we understand where these people are coming from and why they have to do what they do and actually saying that black people do n't deserve the vote , that Afrikaners deserve to have power , \" Polakow - Suransky said .\" At some point it went beyond just understanding and it became an actual expression of support for certain people . \"Gideon Shimoni , a professor emeritus at Hebrew University who has written a seminal text on South African Jewry , met Polakow - Suransky early on in his research .They both say that Shimoni advised him to drop the subject because he would never gain access to the needed documents to make his case .Now that he has read the book , Shimoni is impressed with Polakow - Suransky 's achievement .But he thinks Polakow - Suransky failed to maintain his objectivity in alleging ideological similarities . \"He allowed himself to be too judgmental , \" said Shimoni .He cited specifically the book 's depiction of Peres .Even Polakow - Suransky acknowledged that Peres became his big villain , a hypocrite who spoke out against apartheid in public but fostered the relationship in secret .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.406265"}
