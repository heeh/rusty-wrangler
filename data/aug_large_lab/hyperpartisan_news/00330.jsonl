{"text":"Meanwhile Hillary Clinton 's favorability numbers have taken a little bit of a hit- she was at 78/10 with Democratic primary voters in April , but now she 's at a 63/25 spread .The ideological divide is actually not that stark on the Democratic side .Sanders is ahead with ' somewhat liberal ' voters ( 45/32 ) , ' very liberal ' ones ( 46/37 ) , and moderates ( 40/36 ) alike .And although there is certainly a gender gap Sanders is ahead with both men ( 44/30 ) and women ( 41/38 ) .But the real big divide we see is along generational lines- Clinton is ahead 51/34 with seniors , but Sanders has a 45/29 advantage with everyone under the age of 65 .New Hampshire is somewhat a world unto itself in the Democratic race .We 're still finding Clinton well ahead everywhere else .But it 's clear there 's a real race now in the Granite State .It is notable that Sanders ' support comes from somewhat liberal , very liberal , and moderate voters responding to this poll .As other evidence has shown , Sanders ' support is broad based , and not a left - wing phenomenon .Sanders ' views are far more mainstream than many Clinton supporters would like to acknowledge .This , along with the generational divide , is also consistent with what I have argued previously that Sanders represents the future for the Democratic Party .Winning in New Hampshire , especially if Sanders also does well in Iowa , should give him a boost in polls in subsequent states , but it will still be a tough challenge to beat Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination .After George McGovern won the nomination in 1972 , party rules were written to favor the \" establishment \" candidate over an \" insurgent \" candidate .It would be necessary for Sanders to win well over half the delegates awarded in primary and caucus states due to Clinton 's current support from the super - delegates .Barack Obama did show that Clinton could be beat , but his campaign was boosted by support from party insiders such as Ted Kennedy and John Kerry .The scandals surrounding Clinton could alter this usual dynamic .It is also hoped that the debates will further help Sanders in the national polls against Clinton , but the DNC is protecting Clinton by prohibiting candidates from participating in any debates other than the six sanctioned by the party .In the 2007/8 debates Obama did soundly defeat Clinton on the issues , in my opinion , but there are also many conservative Democratic voters who might accept Clinton 's views .The highly discussed prospect of Joe Biden entering the race could change the calculations considerably .This could lead to an additional voice criticizing Clinton from the left ( even if as not as far left as Sanders ) and , more importantly , would lead to a split in the establishment vote and super - delegates , improving the chances for Sanders to win .In another poll , of questionable reliability considering the conservative source , Rasmussen reports that a plurality of Americans ( 46 percent to 44 percent ) believe Clinton should suspend her campaign due to the email scandal .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"92.3452"}
{"text":"As former CBS News producer Mary Mapes speculated , \" They appear to have done that story to appeal specifically to a politically conservative audience that is obsessed with Benghazi and believes that Benghazi was much more than a tragedy .One of the biggest myths in politics is that Republicans support small government .They invariably use calls for small government to oppose most programs when out of office , but government shows tremendous growth whenever Republicans are in power .This includes both new programs and wage and price controls under Richard Nixon to the major expansions in government spending under Ronald Reagan and George Bush .Of course Republicans tend to be selective when discussing big government , ignoring both unfunded wars and their push for greater government interference in the private lives of individuals .Ezra Klein had a post yesterday entitled How Republicans stopped worrying and learned to love big government .This title could actually have been used many times over the past decades and for a variety of policies .Ezra used this for just one particular hypocrisy on the part of Republicans , a \" demand that the federal government start predicting the deficit 30 years into the future .\" Ezra outlined the difficulties in making such projections , and pointed out how this demand contradicts a key Republican belief : .A core insight of conservatism is that central planning fails because economies are too complicated for governments to effectively predict .But if you believe the government can usefully predict the path of the economy not just over the next 10 years but over 30 , then you should be begging the government to intervene more directly in economic affairs .Conservatives are generally correct in this criticism of central planning , as long as this idea is n't used , as many conservatives do , to argue against any government regulation of the economy .This contradiction is also somewhat analogous to another hypocritical argument being made by conservatives lately regarding the IRS handling of Tea Party applications for tax breaks .Conservative economics actually do include some core beliefs which make sense .However , modern conservatives tend to fail to understand how these principles apply to the real world , while liberals tend to agree with these conservative beliefs where they make sense ( despite the many straw man attacks seen on liberal views from the right ) .Subscribe By Email .Search .Calendar .Archives .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"92.437805"}

Hank Johnson ( D - Ga . ) that would curtail the sale of DOD weapons to local police departments .The killing of 18-year - old Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo. , has produced a rare and surprisingly unified response across the ideological spectrum , with Republicans and Democrats joining to decry the tactics of the city 's police force in the face of escalating protests .Most notably , the reactions reflect a shift away from the usual support and sympathy conservatives typically show for law enforcement in such situations .Although possibly unique to the circumstances of the events in Missouri this week , the changing reaction on the right is clear evidence of a rising and more vocal libertarian wing within the Republican Party .No better sign of that came Thursday than in an article by Sen. Rand Paul ( R - Ky . ) published on Time 's Web site .\" If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager , there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off , \" he wrote . \" But , I would n't have expected to be shot . \" In his piece , Paul criticized what he called the growing militarization of local police forces .\" There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace , \" he wrote , \" but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response .\" This comes as a change from what we generally expect from Republicans : .Since Richard M. Nixon made cracking down on crime a central issue of his 1968 presidential campaign , Republicans have held themselves up as the alternative to a Democratic Party they have derided as soft on issues of law and order .But an appetite for changes in the criminal justice system has been building among Republicans , many of whom believe the tough - justice approach has run its course .Mr. Paul , Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin are among those who say that the federal and state governments need to rethink the way convicts are sentenced and imprisoned , arguing that the current system is inhumane and too costly .Mr. Paul 's remarks on Thursday were similar to those of other leading conservatives who have weighed in on the events in Ferguson .\"Civil liberties must be protected , but violence is not the answer .\" Erick Erickson , a conservative writer , took to Twitter to question why the police needed to display so much firepower .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"120.729195"}
