Clark .The abstract sums up the situation neatly .Both the public and sentencing judges regard silenced firearms as more dangerous than ordinary unsilenced firearms , and the federal penalty for possession of a silenced firearm during crime is a 30-year mandatory minimum .The assumption that silenced firearms are more dangerous than ordinary firearms has never been empirically researched .This study examines federal and state court data to compile statistics on who is being prosecuted for possession of silencers and what crimes they are used to commit .This data indicates that both on the federal and state level those prosecuted for crimes involving silencers are far less likely to have a criminal record , and are far less likely to actively use their weapon than those people convicted using ordinary unsilenced firearms .The data indicates that use of silenced firearms in crime is a rare occurrence , and is a minor problem .Moreover , the legislative history of silencer statutes indicates that these provisions were adopted with little or no debate .The silencer penalty has been justified by a need to crack down on \" professional criminals \" or to punish people using \" dangerous weapons .\" The evidence suggests that 30-year minimum sentences make no sense .Mandatory minimums should be repealed and sentencing judges permitted to treat each case on an individualized basis .I was thinking recently about how pointless many laws are .Too often legislation is written and passed in an attempt to solve ( or appear to be attempting to solve ) some real or perceived problem , but without any intelligent consideration as to whether there is any logical or practical value to the legislation .Silencer laws seem to fit neatly into that category .It 's not that anyone would be hard pressed to obtain a working silencer as there is a volume of information available on the internet and construction plans are easily available as well .So if a criminal thought that it would be advantageous for him to have a silenced firearm there would be little to stop him from doing so .Again it turns out that like most laws of this type the people it controls is the law abiding citizens and has no effect on the criminals who do n't obey the laws anyway .The author of the paper mentioned above did come up with some historical background on how silencers became dangerous in the eyes of the courts and the politicians .Legislative History of Federal Silencer Regulation .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"45.15101"}

Clark .The abstract sums up the situation neatly .Both the public and sentencing judges regard silenced firearms as more dangerous than ordinary unsilenced firearms , and the federal penalty for possession of a silenced firearm during crime is a 30-year mandatory minimum .The assumption that silenced firearms are more dangerous than ordinary firearms has never been empirically researched .This study examines federal and state court data to compile statistics on who is being prosecuted for possession of silencers and what crimes they are used to commit .This data indicates that both on the federal and state level those prosecuted for crimes involving silencers are far less likely to have a criminal record , and are far less likely to actively use their weapon than those people convicted using ordinary unsilenced firearms .The data indicates that use of silenced firearms in crime is a rare occurrence , and is a minor problem .Moreover , the legislative history of silencer statutes indicates that these provisions were adopted with little or no debate .The silencer penalty has been justified by a need to crack down on \" professional criminals \" or to punish people using \" dangerous weapons .\" The evidence suggests that 30-year minimum sentences make no sense .Mandatory minimums should be repealed and sentencing judges permitted to treat each case on an individualized basis .I was thinking recently about how pointless many laws are .Too often legislation is written and passed in an attempt to solve ( or appear to be attempting to solve ) some real or perceived problem , but without any intelligent consideration as to whether there is any logical or practical value to the legislation .Silencer laws seem to fit neatly into that category .It 's not that anyone would be hard pressed to obtain a working silencer as there is a volume of information available on the internet and construction plans are easily available as well .So if a criminal thought that it would be advantageous for him to have a silenced firearm there would be little to stop him from doing so .Again it turns out that like most laws of this type the people it controls is the law abiding citizens and has no effect on the criminals who do n't obey the laws anyway .The author of the paper mentioned above did come up with some historical background on how silencers became dangerous in the eyes of the courts and the politicians .Legislative History of Federal Silencer Regulation .The history of silencer regulation is complicated , and the documentation of why various provisions were passed is sparse .Courts that have tried to determine the legislative history of some of these provisions have expressed dismay at the paucity of information in the legislative record ( U.S. v.

{"text":"Experimentation has also shown that hot suppressors perform differently from cold ones .The greatest freebore boost comes from hot ones , which stands to reason since a cold suppressor is stealing heat from the propellant gases and slowing their rate of expansion .Interestingly , a hot suppressor also tends to produce the most variance in the degree of freebore boost , making velocity less predictable .You can probably guess what that does for a consistent POI .So we 've got a lot of little effects generated by suppressors .What do they add up to ?By now you might be able to guess that generally speaking , a suppressor is n't going to negatively affect the ballistics of a round .What it is going to do is shift the point of impact for a weapon that has been zeroed to the shooter without a suppressor .The effect is much more pronounced at longer ranges ; at short range you 're typically looking at half a minute of angle ( MOA ) or less , which wo n't exactly jeopardize your chances of hitting your target .But if you 're talking the ranges typical of long guns , you 've got to account for the difference .You can get reasonably consistent POIs with a suppressor , but they wo n't be the same ones you shoot without it .The ideal solution is to have optics that can be switched between two zeroes ; a more practical one is to have a second dope table for shooting with the suppressor so that you can dial in adjustments appropriately .So with short - range engagements - CQB in particular - the suppressor is n't going to make enough difference to matter .Not to complicate matters after all that , I have to add that ammo choice can play a huge role .That crack can be eliminated with the use of subsonic ammunition .Even the cycling of the action makes noise .( In many cases subsonic rounds will solve that problem , too , as they do not produce enough gas pressure to cycle the bolt . )Of course , if you 're shooting a target 400 meters away with a long gun , the clack of the bolt probably is n't a big concern for you , compared to shooting from five meters away with a pistol .So while I certainly do n't want to insult anyone 's intelligence , I 'm obliged to point out that such rounds will have significantly different ballistics than standard loads .Suppressors have legitimate tactical uses , and you need not worry about wrecking your accuracy by using one .Just remember two key factors - the difference is no big deal at short range but matters at long range , and your weapon has two different zeroes with and without a suppressor - and you 'll do fine .In parting , I have to leave you with my very favorite rationalization of why suppressors improve accuracy , courtesy of a guy posting on a firearms optics forum : . \" Suppressors look cool , chicks like cool , and no one wants to blow a shot when a hot chick is checking out their suppressed gun , so you tend to not blow shots so much .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.81255"}

Norman .What are suppressors anyway , and why would anyone want to have one ?In 1909 , Hiram Maxim , the inventor of the famous Maxim Machine gun invented one of the first successful metal suppressors .The device was marketed as the gentleman 's way of target shooting .When the National Firearms Act was passed in 1934 , \" silencers \" and other weapons were added to the Act , which really targeted machine guns , and short - barreled rifles and shotguns .The $ 200 tax required for a tax stamp to make these items legal and registered was a stiff price in those days .A Thompson machine gun only cost about $ 50 back then .( Now a transferable Thompson brings more than $ 20,000 ! )Of course , everyone has seen movies where an assassin screws a \" silencer \" onto a pistol and when he shoots the only sound you hear is a \" pfffft \" and the victim falls down .Despite the fact that in Federal law , the term \" silencer \" is used , the term suppressor is both proper and much more accurate .With certain low - power cartridges , you can get close to what those who actually possess and use suppressors call , \" Hollywood Quiet . \" Close , but not quite that quiet .Think of a firearm suppressor as being similar to a muffler on a car .If firearm suppressors were as big as car mufflers , \" Hollywood Quiet \" could be reality .In real life , however , suppressors reduce the sound of a firearm , but never quite \" silence \" it .How quiet are they ?Short answer : that depends .Bullets traveling below the speed of sound - which actually varies because of many factors - are easy to suppress .For purposes of greatest firearm noise suppression , 1000 feet per second muzzle velocity is used as the baseline for true suppression .Bullets traveling at higher speeds produce a small sonic boom , usually referred to as a \" sonic crack .\" This means that no matter how much you reduce the muzzle blast , if the bullet is supersonic , it still makes noise , just not as much as unsuppressed fire .Perhaps the greatest argument for use of suppressors is hearing protection .Hearing damage and prevention thereof can be confusing when it comes to exact definitions and parameters .Some sources maintain that sustained noise levels over 85 dB can cause permanent hearing damage .Pretty well everyone agrees that noise levels over 140 dB can cause instant permanent hearing loss .The list below gives some common sounds and the approximate dB level associated with these sounds : .This writer and his wife operated a shooting range for several years .Despite the requirement of the range for hearing protection , many new shooters were put off by the muzzle blast and the noise that always seems to leak past hearing protection .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.956894"}

{"text":"I 'm getting one of these made around a 45 caliber upper- and it requires a fairly enormous suppressor .With something quieter like a striker fired bolt action , you can get it down to maybe 115 or so .With something supersonic or something with a pistol sized can , you can forget about anything significantly below 130db .It really does nt do anything more than protect your hearing .Guns are just too damn loud in real life- the completely silent gun is something out of the movies .The De Lisle carbine or De Lisle Commando carbine was a specialist British rifle used during World War II .The designer was William De Lisle .It was based on a Lee - Enfield Mk 3 rifle converted to .45 ACP ( a pistol cartridge ) , using magazines from the M1911 pistol .The primary feature of the De Lisle was its very effective suppressor which made it very quiet in action - indeed working the bolt to chamber the next round makes a louder noise than firing a round .The De Lisle carbine was used by British commandos and special forces , and was accurate to 250 metres .The De Lisle was made in very limited numbers ; about 130 were produced during the period of 1942 to 1945 .Thompson submachine gun barrels were modified to provide the .45 caliber barrel , which was ported to provide a slow release of high pressure gas .This large volume was one of the keys to the effectiveness of the suppressor .The Lee - Enfield bolt was modified to feed the .45 ACP rounds , and the Lee - Enfield 's magazine assembly was replaced with a new assembly that held a M1911 magazine in place .The De Lisle is known to have seen service during the Malayan Emergency , and it is thought that there may still be small numbers in service for military situations requiring a silenced weapon .Seems there 's someone right here on THR who owns one of these .Reportedly , all one can hear is the firing pin hitting the primer .I want one ... :) .And yes , I know the 250 meter claim is kinda over the top ... but quiet , they are .That article was written by someone that has never owned one or fired one .They do make noise , and the projectile striking the target makes noise as well .Compare to bolt action 22 's with big cans and quadruple the aperature for the bullet and you can imagine they are nt completley silent by any stretch of the imagination .SRT has been making a ton of rifles very close to the Delisle for years ( but with more advanced baffles ) and they rarely go far below 120 db .And despite all this , the delisle is pretty much the apex of what you can accomplish- like I said in my article about striker - fired bolt actions using subsonic ammo .Criminals today can tape a 2L soda bottle full of foam peanuts over the barrel of a gun and accomplish essentially the same thing as a suppressor , but few ever bother to do this .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"86.979164"}
