{"text":"It 's quite the rage .Yet an effort to spur development of the solar panel industry in the Sunshine State has been derailed by state Rep. Ritch Workman , R - Time Share , who insisted the moment simply is n't right to pursue an obvious alternative energy source .And just when will the time be right ?Around the time the solar energy industry coughs up at least $ 18 million in campaign contributions to keep Tallahassee fat and happy with an unlimited supply of Kibbles ' n ' Bits .At issue was a proposed constitutional amendment to create tax breaks for solar panel businesses .While the constitutional amendment process is frequently abused and overused , it is also often the only way to pursue public policy when a feckless Florida Legislature is too cowed by deeply entrenched special interests .The solar panel constitutional amendment passed with bipartisan support in the Senate Community Affairs Committee .But then it ended up the lap of Workman , R - Go Fetch , who chairs the House Finance and Tax Committee .What happened ?Think Old Yeller .That a proposed constitutional amendment to support an alternative energy source would die should hardly come as a surprise .Over the past five years , Florida Power & Light , Duke Energy , TECO and Gulf Power have pumped more than $ 18 million into legislative and state political campaigns , including $ 3 million in this election cycle .Then add another $ 12 million on lobbyists to tighten their hold over the state 's electricity customers .That probably explains why Workman , R - Good Boy , Good Boy , took time away from shilling for the utility companies to insist he was not a shill .Indeed , Workman claimed he is weary from propping up the solar industry .Little wonder the poor committee chairman is so pooped , especially since the Florida Legislature has consistently carried the megawatts for the utilities , such as allowing Duke Energy to continue to collect $ 1.5 billion in nuclear recovery fees for a power plant that will never be built .And just last year , the Florida Legislature voted down a bill that would have required utilities to disclose the fees to customers .The Legislature could pass a law ending the revolving door of Public Service Commission members going back and forth to work for the utilities or functioning as lobbyists for the industry .Good luck with that .Or - and here is an heretical notion - the Legislature could empower PSC members to actually regulate the state 's utilities on behalf of the public instead of functioning as nodding bobblehead dolls .Republican legislators never miss an opportunity to extol the principle of competitive marketplaces and the need to encourage and nurture innovation .But what chance does a burgeoning alternative energy industry have against the state 's power grid giants when a constitutional amendment asking the voters to approve solar panel tax breaks can be effectively censored by a single beholden lawmaker ?There 's not much doubt the state 's utility oligarchs have received a solid return for their $ 18 million in legalized baksheesh and a corps of professional schmoozers totaling one lobbyist for every two elected state schnauzers .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"47.07139"}

In fact , the DWP is already working on programs to generate about 900 megawatts of solar power , and it did n't stop to ask voter permission .It should do the same with the 400 megawatts of in - basin rooftop energy .So it ought to make voters wonder : Why is Measure B on the ballot , if it 's not needed to produce the energy ?Proponents say they 're acting out of concern for full disclosure and transparency .That 's simply laughable .Something else is going on here .It 's a grab for power -- the political kind , not the solar stuff -- by the City Council and the union that represents DWP workers .That might be OK if it got the city its best possible solar program , but it does n't .Measure B does n't even make clear what the city 's solar program will be .It simply sets a goal , requires the DWP to create a plan , then allows the City Council to adopt it or not , as it sees fit .The important parts are not in the ballot arguments or the campaign literature .Measure B , if passed , would transfer oversight of in - basin solar power from a five - member commission , with at least a modicum of political independence , to the City Council .But because the measure would allow the council to change or suspend everything that 's in it , the council 's new authority would not be accompanied by new accountability .On the contrary , this measure would give the council sweeping political cover .If it 's in the council 's interest to proceed with the plan , it can claim voters told them to do it .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"63.790085"}

Rick Scott and the legislative majority are choking off budget resources for environmental protection and conservation , including failing to invest in infrastructure improvements demanded by climate change which affects protection and sustainability of Florida 's freshwater supply .In the recent legislative session , the conservative majority sought to further shed the state 's environmental responsibilities , over - compensating special interests with policies proposed and favorable to satisfying a laundry list of their lobbyists ' wants and needs .These included a major rewrite of state water policy that rewards polluters , strips meaningful language to protect Florida 's freshwater aquifer and springs and undermines the state 's commitment to restoration of the Everglades .It includes supporting legislation to bar local governments from enacting prohibitions on fracking , a process which involves drilling thousands of feet below ground and forcibly injecting millions of gallons of toxic chemicals into layers of rock to release gas and oil .To do this , they ignored the fact that rock in Florida is mostly limestone , porous as Swiss cheese , highly vulnerable to leeching contamination , and a geological freeway into the state 's freshwater aquifers .Fracking subjects the water supply for millions of residents to the threat of chemical poisoning .And that 's only one issue with the process .Meanwhile , the Miami H erald reports , phosphorus and ammonia levels increased dramatically in the aquifer under Biscayne Bay after Florida Power & Light Co. started sucking up as much as 100 million gallons a day of freshwater to cool its nuclear reactors at Turkey Point .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"65.12694"}
