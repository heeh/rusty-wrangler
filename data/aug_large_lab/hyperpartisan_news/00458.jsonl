{"text":"The official invitation to discuss UFOs privately came in an August 4 , 1993 letter from Rockefeller to Gibbons .Along with representatives from Gibbons office , Richard Farley , Rockefeller , Henry Diamond , Dr. Scott Jones , Dr. John Mack , Dr. Bruce Maccabee , Dr. Leo Sprinkle , Linda Moulton Howe , Dr. Steven Greer , and Keith Thompson attended .Diamond wrote a letter to Gibbons informing him that Mr. Rockefeller would like to have another meeting to discuss UFOs .The meeting was set up through the cooperation of John L. Petersen , who had worked in the Office of the Secretary of defense , and on the National Security Staff at the White House .At the time of the briefing , Petersen was the director of the Washington area think tank known as the Arlington Institute .[ vi ] .There were two reasons for this .James Woolsey and his wife , Sue Woolsey ( Chief Operating Officer of the National Academy of Sciences ) had experienced a daylight sighting in New Hampshire in the late sixties .In addition , Woolsey was attempting to open things up .The briefing of Woolsey and his wife by Dr. Greer lasted three hours , a very long time in the world of briefings .It led Woolsey to request information from within the CIA about certain cases that had been provided to him by Greer .Woolsey was unable to obtain any further material .Even though Woolsey enjoyed more power to get the answers to the UFO mystery than did Jack Gibbons , he was cut off from President Clinton .Woolsey reportedly only met in person with the President twice during his entire tenure as DCI .Woolsey described his weakened position .Years after Woolsey left the Clinton White House , even he took to telling the plane joke .CIA historian Gerald K. Haines authored it .The unclassified version published a couple years later received wide distribution on the Internet .Greer went on to brief many of the people inside the Clinton White House .From the apparent evidence he was much more active proselytizing White House staff on UFOs than were Jones and Rockefeller .During one interview he mentioned some of the people inside the Clinton administration who had been briefed by himself or his briefing team : .Despite these many briefing , Dr. Greer is only mentioned in passing in the 1,000 pages of material released by the OSTP .This is probably accounted for by the fact that his contacts were outside the OSTP , and the record of his contacts will not be available until 2006 when the Clinton files become subject to FOIA .The lack of OSTP references to Greer does not mean that Greer and Rockefeller did not cross paths .Greer did have contact with Laurance Rockefeller .The complete record of their association is not totally known yet .What is know is that Greer did at one time have close connections with Dr. Gibbons UFO briefer Laurance Rockefeller .A few months before doing his briefing with Woolsey , Dr. Greer had met with Rockefeller at his ranch near Jackson Hole , Wyoming .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"58.58793"}

{"text":"Clinton did act .Secondly , the Clinton administration acted by green lighting a new investigation into the Roswell crash .The investigation was conducted by the Air Force with an input from Clinton 's Science Advisor 's office .When the Air Force came back with a whitewash report stating nothing about the 1947 crash was extraterrestrial , Bill Clinton acted again .After receiving the final report in November 1995 , he stood up in a speech in Belfast Northern Ireland and challenged the conclusion .Speaking of the Roswell crash he stated , \" If the Air Force did recover bodies , they did n't tell me , and I 'd like to know .\" This forced the Air Force to do a second investigation of the Roswell crash which was released in 1997 .That report whitewashed the alien bodies reports that Clinton was referring to by stating the reports of bodies came from tests the Air Force had done years after the crash where they dropped dummies from planes .Thirdly , under the Clinton administration , the CIA conducted a new investigation into 50 years of UFO CIA sightings reports .Although there is n't yet any paperwork linking Clinton to this new study that was published in 1997 , there is no way the study would have been conducted without the knowledge and support of President Clinton .Fourthly , the Clinton administration was involved in the Rockefeller Initiative .Philanthropist Laurance Rockefeller approached the Clinton White House to get the President to disclose the truth behind UFOs and was not turned away .There are hundreds of pages released by the Clinton White House OSTP office that detailed the interaction between Rockefeller and Dr. John Gibbons , President Clinton 's Science Advisor .Fifthly , there are many stories in Washington that the Clintons were asking government officials about UFOs trying to find out who controlled the secret .This may have been misdirected action by the Clintons , but it was action towards getting the answer .Sixthly , in a story that actually came from Dr. Greer himself , illustrates another move by the Clinton administration to get hard evidence on UFOs . \"An astronaut , \" said Greer , \" had during his career been in possession of a very specific piece of incontrovertible piece of evidence related to UFOs .It is something that if disclosed would clear and definitive .\" This again showed clear evidence that there was action inside the Clinton administration towards UFO disclosure .Seventhly , there are a number of researchers who report that when the Clinton 's could n't get the UFO answer from inside the government , they started to approach researcher to get answers through intermediaries .I know this to be true because I was indirectly involved in one of the cases .Eighthly , Bill Clinton has never avoided the UFO issue when asked about it in public .Ufologists however , have rarely asked him .In the few cases when he was asked he openly talked about his attempts to get answers on Roswell and Area 51 .In 2005 , he even spoke of UFO investigations his administration had conducted in reply to a question that had nothing to do with UFOs .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"60.09002"}

{"text":"It was taken from the January 21 , 1994 Albuquerque Tribune , and included in a collection of articles dealing with the Congressman Schiff Roswell investigation .In hindsight , Secretary Sheila Widnall was probably the last person the Clinton administration should have approached to aid the disclosure process .Widnall came to her job with first class black - world credentials .She had been for six years a trustee of Aerospace Corporation , a half billion - dollar - a - year nonprofit organization that provided management and technical support for the Air Force space program , including half of the black reconnaissance programs supporting the CIA and NSA .These black - world credentials made her the perfect choice for the Air Force which in 1997 spent 40 cents of every dollar on secret projects .It was Widnall who recommended to the White House the seizure by the Air Force of two tracts of public land totaling 3,900 acres around the famous Area-51 test site known in the UFO world as \" Dreamland .\" The area had become famous for UFOs after a man by the name of Bob Lazar went public in the late eighties claiming that he had been involved in a black budget program at the base involving the back engineering of captured flying saucers .Widnall said publicly that getting too close to the base could allow foreign intelligence to gain knowledge about U. S. capabilities .\" Collection of information regarding the air , water , and soils is a classic foreign intelligence practice because analysis of these samples can result in the identification of military operations and capabilities , \" Widnall stated .This led to an entire tourist industry around Area-51 centered on people hiking up into the mountains surrounding the base where they could look down over into the valley towards the flight test center at Groom Lake , and see what was flying around .We will not know for sure who ordered the investigation because Clinton records are not subject to FOIA requests until January 2006 .What is known , is that Air Force Secretary Widnall knew the White House wanted a report on Roswell , and she was writing to Gibbons to report what had been done .Her words appeared at first glance to be very encouraging , .\" I intended to bring it over this morning , but forgot .My policy is that we are declassifying everything even remotely related , and anything our people think still needs to be classified will have to be justified to me .More to follow !On the bottom of the memo Gibbons wrote a note for his primary Roswell expert in the Office , Skip Johns , suggesting they sit down and discuss the report prior to talking to Rockefeller .\" Skip for your scanning .\" Gibbons wrote .JG \" .On May 26 , 1994 Scott Jones wrote another letter to Gibbons to ask if \" there had been enough progress with your look into the Roswell incident to warrant another meeting with Laurance . \"In addition , Jones stated he was writing to update Gibbons on the latest news .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"61.25758"}
{"text":"Rockefeller described his interest in UFOs and ETI this way : .This interest stems from a lifetime of concern and support for innovative thinking in fields such as philosophy , holistic healing , science and spirituality .I have become convinced that we must fulfill more of our human potential if we are to cope with the increasing difficult problems which now challenge our quality of life and our very survival .Rockefeller , according to the Diamond letter was taking this preliminary step to brief Dr. Gibbons in preparation for \" an approach to President Clinton on this subject . \"Rockefeller , the letter said , was prepared to tell President Clinton that , .\" There is a belief in many quarters that the government has long held classified information regarding UFOs which has not been released and that the failure to do so has brought about unnecessary suspicion and distrust .Many believe that the release of such information , if it exists , on a basis consistent with national security considerations , would be a significant gesture which would increase confidence in government . \"Diamond proposed a 45-minute meeting that would be attended by himself , Rockefeller , and Scott Jones , then President of the Human Potential Foundation in Washington , D.C ..There was no indication that the White House would be interested , or would allow an audience on the subject .Jones suggested that the road into the White House , and ultimately the President , was through Jack Gibbons .Gibbons was the official chosen because he had been recently appointed as Science Advisor to the President .Secondly , Jones had known Gibbons when he was at the Congressional Research Service and Jones was special assistant to Senator Claiborne Pell on the Hill .Matrix of UFO Beliefs : Briefing and Document Scandal .On April 14 , 1993 , at 7:30 a.m. Rockefeller and Dr. C.B.

{"text":"The Subject is as Important as any We Will .Ever Face .This Information Belongs to the World .Although some around President Clinton seemed determined to exclude UFOs from the presidential list of \" things to do , \" Clinton himself , had always exhibited a strong interest in the subject of UFOs .In many of his public speeches he mentioned UFOs or joked about them .One example was when he commented quite positively over the 1996 alien invasion movie \" Independence Day . \" The movie had been screened for Bill and Hillary Clinton in the White House on July 6 by Bill Pullman who played the president in the movie , along with director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin .Not only did he talk openly about the movie with reporter Tom Brokaw , he even found a moral in the fictional alien story of aliens attacking the earth .That moral Clinton attached to his comment was exactly the same one former President Reagan had attached to his alien invasion comments made between 1985 and 1987 .\" I loved it .I loved it and --Mr .Pullman came and showed it .I thought he made a good president .And we watched the movie together , and I told him after it was over he was a good president , and I was glad we won .And it made me wonder if I should take flying lessons .The good thing about Independence Day is there 's an ultimate lesson for that -- for the problems right here on Earth .We whipped that problem by working together with all these countries .And all of a sudden the differences we had with them seemed so small once we realized there were threats that went beyond our borders .And I wish that we could think about that when we deal with terrorism and when we deal with weapons proliferation -- the difference between all these others problems .That 's the lesson I wish people would take away from Independence Day .\" It was a matter of action and policy which Clinton loved , even on holidays .Holidays were things that Clinton hated .Vacation represented inaction and being cut off from the people .Nothing , however , was put out by the White House Press Office which indicated UFOs were on the vacation agenda .This was undoubtedly because it was not an item high in the polls , and the possible damage that might occur by announcing the meeting could not be justified by the few votes that might be gained .The press did not make any mention of the UFO briefing , perhaps because they were sidetracked by another story that had run in the local paper .Rumors circulated among the reporters , the day after Clinton arrived at the Rockefeller Ranch , that Barbra Streisand was in Jackson Hole , and might have had supper with the President .Such as story was an addictive high for reporters .When she returned home , Hillary had reportedly banned Streisand from the White House when she was out of town .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"61.415665"}

{"text":"Part of the reason for the lack of questions to Hillary has to be traced back to the reluctance of the media to deal seriously with the subject .This was clearly shown when the first 14 Freedom of Information requests were released by the Clinton Library in early November 2007 .Many of the first requests that were released by the 6 archivists who had been working on requests since the first FOIA filing were made in January 2006 were on UFOs .The reason for this is that FOIAs work on a first come first serve basis and Grant Cameron had filed around 100 UFO related FOIAs early in the process .These many requests were based on information obtained in 2000 when the Clinton administration released 1000 pages related to the Rockefeller UFO initiative .When the media became aware of the fact that many of the first UFO releases from the Clinton Library involved UFOs many of them jumped to do stories .This included Andrew DeMillo at the Associated Press , Fox News , and Libby Copeland at the Washington Post .All three media outlets interviewed at length Grant Cameron , who had filed the FOIAs .Each was told that about the Rockefeller Initiative to the Clinton White House on UFOs .Each was also told about the role that Hillary Clinton had played in the Clinton administration response to Rockefeller 's UFO overtures .There 's so much we can do if we work together as a world .Now remember that movie Independence Day where invaders were coming from outer space and the whole world was united against the invasion ?Well why ca n't we be united on behalf of our planet , and that 's what I want to do - to get more and more of our people to understand that and get involved to protect our environment .[ 44 ] .The second unprompted reference to aliens came when Hillary was a guest on the Ellen Degeneres show in September 2007 just as Hillary was beginning the campaign .Hillary starting talking about people thinking she was an alien .She stated , \" Oh , I guess that I am some sort of creature from an alien world I suppose .\" [ 45 ] .The strange think about the comment is that this is not the first time it happened .When she and Bill were in the White House there were a number of speeches where particularly Bill made reference to the fact that people were trying to make him and Hillary out as aliens .The UFO community was prepared for change , and quickly raced to back Obama .The reality , however , was that Obama was doing nothing significant to indicate he was sympathetic to the UFO issue or even interested .One example of this was the first time his campaign was faced with the issue when Washington reporter Dana Milbank from the Washington Post questioned the Obama campaign about putting an end to the \" government - imposed truth embargo on the facts confirming an extraterrestrial presence . \" Bill Burton , an Obama campaign spokesman replied , \" We 're more focused on lifting the government - imposed truth embargo on issues like the war in Iraq .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"61.931377"}

McDonald .He began his studies at Reed College in Portland , Oregon in 1946 - 47 and then switched to Stanford University , where he majored in physics earning his bachelor of science in 1950 .He attended UCLA receiving a second bachelor of science in meteorology in 1951 .After a 4-year stint in the Navy Dr. Deardorff went on to achieve an MS ( 1956 ) and PhD ( 1959 ) in Meteorology .After postgraduate work he took a position at the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , CO , in 1962 .There he migrated into the study of laboratory and numerical modeling of turbulent thermal convection , and boundary - layer turbulence and diffusion .After a few years at NCAR he became a senior scientist , enjoying a successful , 16-year research career .A list of the published research papers during this career is provided in an expanded curriculum vitae .After NCAR Jim took a position at Oregon State University in 1978 as a research professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences .It was in Oregon that Dr. Deardorff became interested in extraterrestrial - related phenomenon and by the late 1970s had decided the evidence pointed conclusively towards the ETH .By 1985 his research interests had irrevocably turned to the ETH and its implications for society , and around this time he had the first of five sightings .So in 1986 he took early retirement from OSU .Writing papers and research grant proposals and attending to associated administrative duties no longer seemed as important as exploring extraterrestrial - related phenomenon and trying to raise public awareness .By 1987 he had written three peer - reviewed papers dealing with this new area of interest : David Sereda is a social and environmental activist with a broad range of interests .As with many others , his interest in extraterrestrial - related phenomena was sparked in 1968 by a strong sighting of a large , classic disc - shaped object hovering in a clear sky with hundreds of witnesses shouting with excitement and pointing upwards in amazement .After 20 minutes of watching this object , David saw it disappear .This event created a life - long interest in extraterrestrial - related phenomena which combined with interests in space , religion , philosophy , astronomy and science and led to a multifaceted career in high technology , environmental and humanitarian issues and professional photography .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"77.193214"}
{"text":"February 17 , 2000 .Press Release .Previously , on February 7 , in a packed courtroom , Chief Judge Stephen M. McNamee heard oral arguments on the government 's Motion for Summary Judgment in the FOIA lawsuit , Citizens Against UFO Secrecy ( CAUS ) v. Department of Defense ( DoD ) .CAUS attorney , Peter A. Gersten had submitted numerous affidavits from witnesses who had observed massive , black , triangular shape craft with extraordinary flight characteristics .But the DoD continued to maintain in court it could find no information confirming the existence of such objects .Gersten was seeking an additional 90 days of discovery and an opportunity to depose DoD personnel .During the 30 minute hearing Gersten argued the government 's search for relevant information lacked the necessary element of \" good faith .\" Apparently the Judge agreed .A written opinion would be issued within 30 days .Now the Judge has asked the DoD to provide additional affidavits expanding on the methods used by the DoD to service the FOIA request .These will be reviewed in support of the forthcoming ruling for dismissal or further discovery .CAUS is one of many groups applying pressure for full disclosure by the U. S. government as to the facts regarding UFO / ET phenomena .February 4 , 2000 Press Release .CAUS remains at the forefront of the legal wing of the disclosure movement to require the U. S. government to be forthright regarding all it knows about UFO / Extraterrestrial related phenomena .On Monday , February 7 , Gersten will again step into the courtroom to make oral arguments in a new case , CAUS vs. Department of Defense ( DOD ) .This case seeks to learn what the DOD knows about large triangle shaped craft seen repeatedly within the United States and elsewhere .These craft are reported to be larger than a football field and capable of hovering in complete silence .In Phoenix , Arizona , U. S. District Court Judge Stephen M. McNamee denied DOD motions to dismiss , thus setting the stage for a rare opportunity to submit oral arguments on behalf of the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit .Gersten has submitted affidavits from witnesses who have observed these unusual , black , triangle shaped objects .The Department of Defense has maintained it could find no information confirming the existence of such craft .CAUS also is engaged in another lawsuit , CAUS v. United States of America ; Secretary of Defense Cohen ; Attorney General Reno ; State of Arizona ; and Governor Jane Dee Hull .In addition CASU is considering an FOIA lawsuit targeting the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .Washington , DC - Paradigm Research Group has given two awards of excellence to websites addressing extraterrestrial related phenomena .The purpose of the EXTRA is to raise the awareness of the media and public toward the quality and professionalism of websites devoted to extraterrestrial phenomena .The public perception is that the UFO presence on the Internet is silly , casual , and poor in quality .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"77.20866"}

{"text":"Although Ronald and Nancy Reagan have been written up by many historians as not always in touch with reality , the fact is that many first families who had occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Ave , were also according to available records , quite interested in things of the paranormal .A quick review shows that it was not unusual at all to find a First Lady or president with an interest in ghost , séances , or UFOs .Consider for example : .The wife of President Abraham Lincoln , Mary Todd Lincoln , hosted as many as eight séances in the White House .President Lincoln , himself , attended at least one of these séances held in the White House on April 23 , 1863 .Mrs. Lincoln claimed success . \"Willie lives , \" said Mrs. Lincoln , \" he comes to me every night and stands at the foot of the bed with the same sweet adorable smile he always has had . \"President Theodore Roosevelt claimed that he felt the presence of Lincoln in the Lincoln bedroom .He was rumored to have kept his \" astrological chart mounted on a chess board , and was said to consult it at crucial moments in his presidency . \"Jimmy Carter and his wife believed that a house he lived in from 1955 to 1961 was haunted .In addition to ghosts , President Carter believed that on January 6 , 1969 he witnessed a UFO for ten minutes while waiting for a meeting to begin in a small Georgia town .Both James Garfield and Abraham Lincoln believed they had premonitions that they would be assassinated .Other first ladies who were interested in visionaries , psychics , mediums , astrologers , and human potential advocates included the wives of Ulysses S. Grant , John Tyler , Woodrow Wilson , and Warren G. Harding .The fact then that OSTP files hint that Hillary Clinton continued the trend of interest in UFOs by first ladies should come as no surprise .These OSTP references , along with other public UFO statements , show that Hillary led all First Ladies in her strong interest in UFOs and other paranormal areas of study .Hillary may have been interested in UFOs , but a public speech on the topic was a bit too much of an \" outing .\" The Clintons Get Briefed .The month of August is a hot steamy month in the nations capitol .It is the usual time for the President to escape the heat of the city and the heat of the many congressional skirmishes .The month of August 1995 would be hotter than most Presidential Augusts in history .As well as ultimately being the month when the first family would get a briefing on UFOs from Laurance Rockefeller , it was the month of Monica Lewinsky .It would be the start of the end of the Clinton presidency .Monica Lewinsky had worked at the White House , first as an intern , and then as an employee , from July 1995 to April 1996 .The month of August 1995 , was the month that Monica Lewinsky characterized to investigators as the month when she began \" intense flirting \" with the President .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"78.04479"}
