{"text":"However , in the 2007 Draft Rio Grande Valley Border Fence EIS , it is claimed that the protections of environmental justice do not apply .This questionable judgment is achieved by sleight of hand and is revealed in the following quote : . \" Of the 21 fence sections , 11 are within census bureau tracts in which a portion of the tracts have a higher proportion of minority or low - income residents .Of the proposed 70 miles of tactical infrastructure , substantially less than half is within census bureau tracts that have a higher proportion of minority or low - income residents - therefore the overall impacts of the proposed tactical infrastructure would not fall disproportionately on minority or low - income populations . \"( Section 5 .Rather than stating that the majority of people who will be negatively impacted by the border wall are poor and/or minorities , which is what environmental justice is all about , the EIS counts miles .Miles that fall within US Fish and Wildlife refuge tracts , where no people live , are counted along with the miles that pass through poor communities , allowing them to dilute , at least on paper , the wall 's impact on minority and low - income populations .Mileage is irrelevant to the question of environmental justice .The question is whether a disproportionately high number of the people who will be negatively affected are members of minority and/or low income populations .The EIS does mention in passing that people will lose their homes , stating that , \" Construction of the project would require some acquisition of private property , including the potential dislocation of some property owners and tenants . \" \" Dislocation \" is of course a euphemism for eviction .In communities like Granjeno , where families have passed property down through the generations since the Spanish land grants of the 1760 's , up to a third of the homes will be impacted .Residents evicted to build the Berlin Wall .Hard - working people who may not have the money to hire lawyers are going to have their homes bulldozed or family farms sliced in two for a wall that wo n't stop anyone .DHS is prepared to perpetrate a terrible injustice against the very U.S. citizens that they are supposed to protect .With the introduction of S. 2348 , the \" Emergency Border Security Funding Act of 2007 \" , Texas Senator John Cornyn has once again shown that he values the worst politics ahead of the best interests of Texas and our nation .It calls for at least 700 linear miles of border wall and 300 miles of vehicle barriers along the US - Mexico border , and provides $ 3 billion dollars to get construction started .This despite the fact that the walls built so far have had not impacted the number of people coming across the border .In October , speaking to the Border Trade Alliance , Cornyn said , \" I have long said that I do not support a fence , or as some said , a wall , between the United States and Mexico .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"94.17847"}
