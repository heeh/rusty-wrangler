{"text":"One of the major problems I see is much talk around privilege seems to take the above statement - which I would argue is fairly obvious and should be non - controversial - to embrace a radical subjectivism that is untenable and contradictory .Whilst the disproportionate number of black people in prison must partly be due to racism I think it is sloppy and incorrect the way most people on the left ( both moderate & extreme ) declare this inequality as unarguable evidence of a racist status quo .I think this issue is far more complicated than that and blaming it on racist police , courts , law makers & institutions misses the point .Not only is it wrong to simplify this issue as one of racist oppression , that narrative only serves to feed more young black men into the teeth of the prison system by reinforcing a sense of hopeless victimhood .The disparity in prison populations is almost universal from Los Angeles to London , from American states where most judges and a large proportion of cops are black to British and European justice systems which are steeped in human rights legislation .The geographical location , laws and ethnic backgrounds of the officials differ yet almost universally , in the West black people are being jailed far too much .There are many potential reasons for this other than racism ; from poverty to a belief that the system is racist -therefore crime is the only option- to the hyper masculinity and gang culture which I believe springs from the oppressed / oppressor narrative .I have some experience of this having been on the wrong side of the law myself .In my experience the reason why arrest rates are higher among people of colour has a lot more to do with the choices being made than evil racist cops arresting innocent black guys for fun .One point which is often raised as incontrovertible proof of racism is why the sentencing disparity ?If the system is n't racist why do black guys who get caught with drugs face longer sentences than white guys , why are black youths targeted by the police more than white youths when white people are just as likely to be sniffing coke or smoking dope ?It 's a bloody good point and on the face of it it seems like the only answer can be that Western police forces and criminal justice systems are racist and rotten to the core right ?I disagree !As with most things in life things are far more nuanced .In my opinion the answer to this question ( whilst unfair ) is simple .Violence and gang culture !Whilst there are some seriously dangerous white drug dealers and some harmless pot smoking black kids the likelihood that a white drug offender will have a violent gang affiliation is much less likely than the black drug offender .So whilst I agree that racism plays a role I know that it 's the choices people make that matter as to whether one goes to prison or not .As long as we focus solely on the bogeyman of institutional racism the choices which lead so many of our young black men into the prison system are neglected .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.65088"}

'( emphasis mine ) ' .And the GLAAD award gets hauled out as evidence when people critique the depiction of Kurt , when people ask why the show thinks it 's ok to use slurs against trans people without comment .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"80.46556"}

{"text":"So what is it ?My argument hits on what Gibbs notes as the defining characteristic of this generation : mobile social computing .One of the key attractions of the church in past generations -- social connection -- has been effectively replaced .10 thoughts on \" More on How Facebook Killed the Church \" .This whole business about social networking and community is fascinating to me and I wonder if it might not push on what we mean by church in the first place .Your posts certainly point , I think , to the inadequacy of church defined by voluntary association verses the church as an eschatological people living intentionally around a peculiar story .The first sees the church as a support group , the second as the necessary environment for the ecology of the Kingdom of God .I think , if the second is the case , then social networking might not kill the church but aid its appearing in new ways .I also think that the reason younger people are seeing no use for church is more complex than the lack of need for the social networking congregations once provided .While in some ways younger generations are more conservative , in other ways they are not .Their views on social justice , homosexuality , etc , are more liberal than most traditional churches .There is a principled reaction against religion as well .While I think their values are more traditional in some ways , we live in a post - beauracratic culture where hope is no longer expressed through institutions , as the study you cite also suggests .In other words , part of what they might be rejecting is that church served its parents primarily as a means of social networking .Social media is certainly a part of of this mix .It might be interesting to ask if social media has reduced connectivity of people who do value their congregational experience .My sense is that it has n't .I 'm wondering if the same kind of study you did with student retention might also be true of church .I 'm wondering , in other words , if facebook participation makes persons more likely to stick with a congregation .I think it might .I know I feel more connected to the congregations I 'm associated with because of facebook .I think the relationship might be amplification as much as it is creation / destruction .The web amplifies our commitments .One of the questions I have is does the proliferation of discourse on the web function more to open us to new commitments or move us to greater entrenchment around the values we already have .Researchers are torn about this .Some see twitter and other innovations as the technology necessary for Habermas ' ideal communication to find fruition .I 'm far less optimistic .We read some of the major lit on this in a seminar I took on gospel and cultures last spring .I 'm unconvinced by the idealists .meh .The church killed the church .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"81.53794"}

{"text":"I think the key here is that the title of the post includes the phrase \" what looks like racism \" .This , to me , means the commonplace ( and arguably incorrect ) definition of racism , which is \" talking shit about another race \" .( We can use the power+privilege definition if we want , but it does n't sound like that 's what Readers 1 and 2 are talking about . )So to me , the question is not whether PoC can be racist : this has been addressed many times in the literature , from many viewpoints .Beverly Tatum , for example , writes that using the power+privilege definition , in the U.S. , POC can not be racist , but notes that they can be bigoted and prejudiced ( as can anyone ) .So , if the question becomes \" Should WP call out what looks like bigotry and prejudice when non - white people do it ? \" , I think the answer is \" Yes , but \" .In particular , WP should consider whether it 's a good idea , what the WP will get out of the interaction , what the PoC will get out of the interaction , and what 's actually going on in the situation .It 'd be easy , I think , for many WP to mistake frustration , anger and outrage at WP as \" racism \" .And , I agree with M. Gibson , that WP have to \" clean up their house \" first .If , for example , Rush Limbaugh told off a Black person for making a \" ching chong \" joke , it would be meaningless , no matter how offensive the joke was .And the White person also needs to think about why they want to get involved .Like M. Gibson said , this can come very close to the Arab Trader argument .If the WP is looking to \" prove a point \" and show that \" Hey , look , Black people are racist too ! ! ! \" , then nothing good is going to come out of this , and the WP needs to stop and re - evaluate their thoughts .The one case where I definitely would n't get involved would be a PoC making derogatory and bigoted statements against their \" own \" ethnic or racial group .It 's such a complicated situation , particularly given internal conflicts the person may be feeling ; an outsider just woudn't have enough information to say anything constructive .But if a WP ( in the U.S. ) starts ranting about \" racism \" to a PoC , they need to know that there 's a good chance they 're going to look like a complete moron and forfeit any opportunity for a positive interaction .@Abrasink I would n't say that POC can not be racist .If you look at power sharing amid non - white people here in the States , Blacks have greater media representation and a greater share in the corporate world than say , American Indians .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"84.15425"}

{"text":"Nearly 90 % of respondents said no ( which is understandable -- after all , White men , who have traditionally benefited from preferential hiring , do not feel hampered by self - doubt or a loss in self - esteem ) .Indeed , in many cases affirmative action may actually raise the self - esteem of women and minorities by providing them with employment and opportunities for advancement .There is also evidence that affirmative action policies increase job satisfaction and organizational commitment among beneficiaries ( Graves & Powell , 1994 ) .There 's some interesting stuff about Texas which may be relevant here , if anyone else is still reading .Hopgood vs Texas in 1996 resulted in a ruling that race was not to be considered in consideration of applicants to university - that is , overturning the idea that there was a compelling interest in diversity that justified doing such .As we saw , Grutter vs Bollinger reasserted that the compelling state interest represented by the existence of diversity in student intakes justified consideration of race in examining applications , but for a period in Texas the consideration of race was made illegal in considering applications .This was an attempt to keep some diversity in applications , using Texas ' highly segregated school system as a lever .Interestingly , according to the most recent report , although the Top 10 % applicants had lower SAT scores than those accepted through the \" classic \" process , they consistently outperformed them through the freshman year , as they did the previous year .That is , the top 10 % entrants did not look as good as potential students , but turned out to be better students .Which brings us back to Allan Bakke - GPA is not the only criteri on for entry .As an example of a policy that does not ( ostensibly ) consider race but does , by attempting to remove perceived advantages both financial and cultural that are prejudicial to the chances of talented students in minority groups , this is quite interesting .It is also interesting that one of the arguments used by UMich in Grutter vs Bollinger was that students generally achieve better results in culturally and racially diverse environments - that is , that ensuring representation of diverse races and cultures also helps the majority members on campus .That presents an interesting and utilitarian case for the consideration of race as a factor in admissions policy .I remain undecided , although of course this is no longer a discussion about political correctness , a rhetorical and/or taxonomic concept , but affirmative action , a legal concept .I would probably cautiously incline towards the view of Supreme Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , that affirmative action in the Johnsonian sense remains a useful tool to compensate for ingrained privilege in certain circumstances but that its application should be with the ultimate aim of rendering itself obsolete .However , unless one is to adopt a crudely doctrinaire position in either direction - which is certainly a grunty grunty option - there are an awful lot of considerations to weigh up , and many different environments to consider .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"84.38827"}

{"text":"WILLIAM LAWRENCE , Dean and Professor of American Church History , Perkins School of Theology , Southern Methodist University For about three decades , there has been an enduring assumption that conservative churches are growing while liberal churches are declining .That period of time has overlapped with the rise of right - wing Christianity as a political force in American life .Together , the thesis about conservative church growth has been assumed to be accurate and the tactics of right - wing religiosity have been politically effective .Few journalists , sociologists , or religious researchers have ( until recently ) bothered to probe very deeply beneath the surface of these propositions .Yet some things are quite well known .The issues that matter to right - wing religious forces ( notably opposition to the practice of homosexuality and opposition to the freedom of choice with regard to terminating a pregnancy ) are not intensely hot - button issues for the millennial generation .To the extent that religious organizations have decided that they would tie their perspectives to a specific ideology on such moral questions , they have given millennials permission to disengage from religious organizations .Spirituality clearly matters to the younger generations .But ideological battles over issues that they do not consider spiritually decisive seem at best a waste of time .And at worst , such arguments are proof that younger persons will have to look elsewhere - not to established religious organizations - for meeting their spiritual needs .In the 1960s , many religious organizations lost touch with a younger generation who eagerly awaited a sign from the churches that civil rights and social justice mattered .Lacking such a clear sign , many of the young simply drifted away from church .It is now apparent that in more recent decades the zealous combination of right - wing politics and rigid religious moralism on a few topics has caused the newest generation of the young to become disenchanted and disengaged .Churches have to rediscover that at the core of their missionary responsibilities is reaching those who are not yet part of the religious organization .Until we do that , decline and disengagement will be the hallmarks of the way that younger generations view the church .LARRY BETHUNE , Senior Pastor , University Baptist Church , Austin I am neither a sociologist nor a statistician ; my observations are anecdotal , but they are from the \" front line .\" Fifteen years ago , the same Robert Putnam published \" Bowling Alone , \" an essay ( followed by a book ) about \" America 's declining social capital .\" Noting that the number of individuals bowling had increased while the number of league participants decreased , Putnam observed the general decline of participation in American social institutions .In my experience , this trend has continued in churches of all kinds , regardless of their political leanings .I suspect the involvement of some churches in extremist conservative politics does explain part of this decline .The polarizing , attacking rhetoric turning local houses of worship into partisan political caucuses is not only obviously damaging to the broader social fabric , but a betrayal of core Christian values regarding love , service , and concern for the poor .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"85.09021"}

{"text":"It 's cruel , it 's rude , and it 's against the NY Times ' own style guide , but Burkett is allowed to get away with it .Brain Sex .Moving on , the next thing Burkett does is to present trans people as having as a core ideology the belief that we are born with binary male or female sexed brains .Now , it is true that Caitlyn Jenner makes sense of her identity as a woman by saying , as Burkett quotes , \" My brain is much more female than it is male .\" There are many binary trans people who use this sort of language to try to explain what it feels like to have a gender identity that does n't match one 's assigned sex .But please note that the reason trans people do this so often is because cis people constantly demand that we explain how we know we are trans , and where our trans identities come from .Thirty years ago , when I was in college , straight people were always asking gay men and lesbians how they were sure they were \" homosexual , \" and what made them gay .Back then , lots of LGB people were very interested in brain studies that claimed to show that gay men had brain characteristics similar to those of women , while lesbians had brain areas that were similar to those of men .Today , that just sounds silly , and scientific exploration of the idea that lesbians think like men and that gay men have girl brains has largely petered out , because people no longer demand to know what biological factor could possibly explain sexual orientation .With the depathologization of same - sex attraction , the search for some biological basis to explain it has faded away .But when it comes to gender identity , many cis people still refuse to accept a person 's self - report of how they feel .They demand that we \" prove \" our gender identities , and explain our \" compulsion \" to gender transition .There are scientists studying this question by examining brains , and so some trans people turn to this idea when asked to justify themselves .What Burkett does not acknowledge is that there are many trans people , myself included , who are quite critical of the idea that there is some simple brain center that determines gender identity .There are many , like myself , who discuss how so much of the neurological research into \" brain sex \" has been deeply flawed , and used to bolster misogyny .What the differences found in the brains of deceased men and women show is that we die with slightly different brains , not that we are born with our gender identities stamped in some simple way on our hypothalamus or some other brain center .The fact that trans women 's brains resemble those of cis women 's reveals shared identity and experiences , but the factors being studied as differing between women and men are tiny .\" Brain sex \" is a complex and subtle thing -- not some matter of pink brain centers that are obsessed with makeup and blue ones that refuse to ask for directions .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"88.2509"}

{"text":"RIC DEXTER , Men 's Division Chapter Leader , Nichiren Buddhist Soka Gakkai lay organization To understand what young Americans think , perhaps it is best to ask one .The response this week comes from Casey Bennett , SGI Central USA Student Division Leader : .Many youth I speak with feel they are estranged from their church groups because of the way that they live , whether it 's the clothes that they wear , the way they present themselves , the fact that they have tattoos , or even if they are homosexual .Many churches and synagogues do not engage the interest of the youth .I often hear said that the rules and customs of their religion can at best be considered dated , thus driving them away in droves .Exceptions to this rule are found in the realms of Islam , Buddhism or Baha'i .When speaking to my Muslim friends , it seems their community has done a better job of instilling a sense of a community that cherishes the youth .This trend is echoed in certain sects of Buddhism ( especially in the Soka Gakkai ) and the Baha'i faith .Many young converts to Buddhism and Baha'i embrace the fact that they are judged less on their lifestyle and choices in style , and more on the fact that it is one 's actions that truly make one great .This being said , when a person in these faiths is not acting in accord with the teachings they are encouraged to continue their journey of self - discovery and self - mastery rather than trying to fit into a mold cast thousands of years ago .This open , hands - off approach to faith seems to strike a chord with large numbers of youth wanting to continue expressing themselves as individuals , while being open to heart to heart guidance without constant judgment .After all , faith is , and should always be , a personal thing , one that each person must engage in and cultivate .My teacher , Dr. Ikeda explained , \" Each person has a precious and irreplaceable mission .As the Buddhist teaching of cherry , peach , plum , and damson blossom indicates , each person can be considered a special , distinct flower . \"\" Each individual is a capable person in his or her own way ; each person has a valuable purpose .That is why it is crucial for us to foster and support [ young people ] with all our hearts .\" ROBIN LOVIN , Cary Maguire University Professor of Ethics , Southern Methodist University My guess is that the \" millennial \" generation has detached themselves psychologically from all sorts of organizations , not just from organized religion .Of course , it 's easier to quit church than to quit the economy , though lots of millennials are having a hard time getting a serious career started .Some millennials have shown a passionate interest in politics , both of the Obama Nation and the Tea Party varieties , but that is a recent enthusiasm , and nobody knows how long it will last .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"89.42169"}

'That message serves as a kind of moral compass for the education Harvard College imparts .In the classroom , in extracurricular endeavors , and in the Yard and Houses , students are expected to act with integrity , respect , and industry , and to sustain a community characterized by inclusiveness and civility .As we begin at Harvard , we commit to upholding the values of the College and to making the entryway and Yard a place where all can thrive and where the exercise of kindness holds a place on par with intellectual attainment .The original plan was to post the pledge in each dorm entryway , along with the names and signatures of the students living there .Although signing was supposed to be voluntary , any dissent would have been obvious .The posting constituted \" an act of public shaming , \" Harry R. Lewis , a computer science professor and former dean of Harvard College , wrote in a blog post condemning the pledge .Some students signed because they felt they had to -- a completely predictable , yet somehow unforeseen , result that Tom Dingman , the dean of freshmen , says is \" against the spirit of the pledge .\" The signatures will no longer be posted .Yet what the Harvard Crimson dubs the \" freshman kindness pledge \" remains in place .The vast majority of freshmen , and the college itself , have formally declared that \" the exercise of kindness \" is \" on par with intellectual attainment .\" Both parts of that equation are odd , and they are odd in ways that suggest something has gone awry at Harvard .No Kindness Deficit .That problem is n't , as some might imagine , a kindness deficit .Do n't confuse the real - world Harvard with the one in the movies . \"As best I can tell , it 's a perfectly civil , polite , kind , cooperative student body , \" says Steven Pinker , the Harvard psychology professor and popular author .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"89.46837"}

{"text":"January 15 , 2016 9:03 pm .Reflecting on this essay , one can not deny the obvious conclusion that Millenials see things differently than do the previous generations .I notice it in my own ministry and in the ministries of my colleagues .My initial thought is that this generation is neither lost or enlightened , but rather shaped by a culture that has been created by the effects of being systemically , and systematically abandoned by the adults in their lives .Adults have touted the importance of ethical standards and behaviors ( \" true love waits , \" \" What Would Jesus Do ? \") , but often time failed to live up to the standards of holiness they preached .Rather than engage the culture that their kids lived in , adults sought to offer entertaining alternatives , which in a sense created a sub culture of sorts .Adults offered conflicting and contradictory messages without adequately explaining the reasoning behind why taking life in abortion is forbidden , but killing someone on the battlefield was acceptable and perhaps even encouraged .I know it is a generalization , but adults have not done an adequate job of being present to guide Millenials through these vital life questions .So what do we do now ?A few thoughts came my way while reading this essay today .In our ministries , I think it is vital to explore clear ethical boundaries in a way that encourages a discourse among the entire Church , but has as its foundation the love and grace of Christ .I believe the Church must engage culture ( rather than run from it or ignore it ) by erasing the sacred - secular boundary and bringing Christ into all parts of life .Finally , I think we need to call our congregations to a renewed vision of the value and sacredness of all life in Creation .Perhaps we can not undo the damage that has been done by previous abandonment , but maybe we can realistically engage those that fall into the Millenial generation .Robert Merrills .January 15 , 2016 10:39 pm .I do n't know that blog gives us enough information to lump a segment of society together and make a definitive claim either way .One thing Professor Oord post demonstrates is that thoughts about significant topics vary among the identified generations , which invites the question \" why do the generations you think that way they do ? \"As members of churches that may have pretty clear stances on same - sex marriage , abortion and war , it can be easily to hide behind doctrinal statements and substitute emotion with reason and bully our way through conversations that may sound pretty intolerant .At the same time the issues addressed in the blog are significant and still pose real challenges to and opportunities for the church to lead in love .One option is to develop the structure for having cross generational discussions on contemporary issues .This will better equip the church to understand what the issue , the foundation for generational opinions ( understanding generations do n't think exclusively one way ) and then to best articulate the churches beliefs while reinforcing the need to demonstrate Christ 's love through the process .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"89.64665"}

E. B.

{"text":"Yet he goes about it by insulting the kids when they get an answer wrong , which is often .It is possible that Mr. Garrison teaches the students more about pop culture because he himself does not know a lot about the school curriculum , or just does n't pay attention to it .One of Mr. Garrison 's common personality traits since giving up Mr. Hat is how his aggressive behavior now causes him to take things to the extremes .When he came out as gay , he began performing extremely vulgar homosexual acts with Mr. Slave .Of course , part of this was most likely because of the fact he wanted to get fired in order to sue the school .However , after becoming a woman , he became obsessed with declaring how much of a woman he was in the loudest and again most vulgar way .For example , he once shouted loudly to other women about how wonderful it was to have a period .Later , when Mrs. Garrison begins a brief relationship with Richard Dawkins , she gives up her religious faith due to the fact the Dawkins found her attractive and then became obnoxiously vocal about Atheism to the point of being fanatical .The same held true for when Mrs. Garrison decided to be come a lesbian following a one - night stand with another woman .Following the encounter , Mrs. Garrison began to sexually harass all the women at the local lesbian bar and became obsessed with the idea of having random sex with women .These extreme shifts and stances of belief mixed with his already aggressive behavior makes it to where Garrison is often verbally abusive to any and all who disagree with him .All of this suggests that he is an extreme narcissist .Due to the fact that Mr. Garrison has had both male and female relationships during the course of the series , it is now unclear whether or not he can or should still be considered gay , but rather pansexual .Since Garrison 's last relationship was lesbian in nature prior to returning back to being a male , it has not been made clear what Garrison 's current orientation is .It was once implied during earlier episodes that Garrison might have had sex with Cartman 's pet pig ' Fluffy ' , meaning he may also enjoy bestiality .In addition , \" Jakovasaurs \" also suggests that same idea when the people are watching the Jakovasaur and Garrison suggests that they let him keep the Jakovasaur .Perhaps the most appropriate description of his orientation is in \" The Death Camp of Tolerance \" , when Chef states that there is a big difference between being gay and being Mr. Garrison , suggesting that he believes Mr. Garrison is a pervert .Mr. Garrison may also be a pedophile , as he was shown attempting to \" hook up \" with young boys in \" Cartman Joins NAMBLA \" .Since returning to male gender in Season Twelve , Mr. Garrison 's behavior as of lad has been shown to be less eccentric than before , having been involved in no acts of deviant sexual behavior , outrageous outbursts , or psychotic episodes .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.212364"}

{"text":"First of all , a person who is queer identifies as someone with a sexual orientation outside culturally established norms .In our culture , it is someone who is not heterosexual - a person who identifies as lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgender .It is someone who does not want to put a label to their sexuality , or someone who is questioning their sexual identity .Dharma in its broadest context means truth or what is , and can also mean the Buddhist teachings - which is saying the same thing .The Buddha experienced the truth of reality and then talked about it .These are the Buddhist teachings that have been written and passed down orally .The path of meditation is the way to gently make the journey from self - deception to truth .So , queer dharma is the truth of being queer .Everyone who is queer realizes at some point in their life 's journey that they have feelings for others , or about themselves , that are outside what is easily accepted in our society .At best , it results in some serious soul searching to come to terms with who one really is , and at worst , imprisonment or death .There are probably not many queer folk planning to vacation in Uganda , Nigeria , or Russia any time soon .Even in relatively tame countries like Canada that have accepted same - sex marriage , there are still unthinkable hate crimes against sexual minorities .Even if we live in a relatively accepting world , there are privileges of heterosexuality that are taken for granted and not available to all .We are holding a \" Shambhala Queer Dharma \" retreat at Shambhala Mountain Center from March 28 - 30 which will add the \" Shambhala \" aspect to the picture .There are two key themes that define Shambhala - that the nature of all humans is basically good , and when people relate to others and the environment from their inherent goodness , a good human society manifests .There are countless examples of good human relationships between people and communities that value kindness above individual self - interest .Sadly , we often doubt our basic goodness and self - worth .This results in a constant attempt to find happiness outside of ourselves as demonstrated by the tyranny of materialism ruling our lives .Putting it all together - what is the inspiration for having a Shambhala Queer Dharma retreat ?Community Queer people have to come to grips with who they are because of the obstacles they face in society .Whether one has achieved peace with that or not , it is good to be with others who respect and recognize your journey .There is comfort and deep relaxation in just knowing that .However , there is something more to these retreats than just the comfort of being with sympathetic people .Meditation By virtue of being queer and outside the societal norm with regard to sexuality , we are required to explore the dharma of ourselves to cut through confusion about who we are and not be afraid of that - probably more than those who have heterosexual privilege .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.33772"}
{"text":"It is because we too are feminists , and we expect more of our feminist cis siblings .When trans activists critiqued the choice to call a feminist event \" A Night of a Thousand Vaginas , \" the goal was not , as Burkett believes , to turn back the clock on feminist progress .It was to urge feminism forward toward greater inclusiveness .Do Trans People Oppose Women 's Institutions ?Another source of panic for Burkett is the idea that trans people are doing damage to institutions such as women 's colleges .She notes that there are students at some women 's colleges who do not identify as women , and that that some individuals at women 's colleges use the term \" siblinghood \" as an alternative to \" sisterhood \" to acknowledge them .And she reports that there are some trans male students who ask their professors to stop using the pronoun \" she \" to refer to a generic , abstract student at the college .The thing is , the focus of most trans advocacy has been on convincing women 's colleges to admit trans women , which is as it should be .Most trans people are fine with the idea of there being women 's spaces and institutions , so long as they do n't exclude trans women .And many of us have in fact written critically of trans male students who decide to continue to attend a women 's college after coming out , and then want the colleges to center their experiences as men .That 's male privilege -- not young trans women daring to assert that they should have a right to be considered for admission by woman 's colleges .Who Owns Feminism ?The last segment of Burkett 's diatribe before she concludes by recapping her dissing of Caitlyn Jenner is both infuriating and smarmy .In it , she discusses who is moving feminism forward , and whether trans people should be welcomed to that project .The smarmy answer is , in her words , that \" we 'll happily , lovingly welcome them to the fight \" if \" they \" do the right thing .The feminist \" we \" is cis gender , and the \" they \" seeking admission are trans people .In this section of her piece , Burkett writes as if trans people did n't exist until a couple of years ago , and up until then , all the good work of seeking gender equality has been done by cis women .She goes on for a while about the revolutionary nature of the amazing work people she describes as \" women like me \" have done in advancing equity and freedom .She describes this as including \" smashing binary views of male and female well before most Americans had ever heard the word ' transgender ' or used the word ' binary ' as an adjective .\" Apparently it has not occurred to Burkett that many trans people have been involved in feminist advocacy for much of their lives .That some of those who have been fighting gender stereotypes as long as she has did so because they had or have nonbinary identities .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.359436"}

{"text":"Indeed , one can say that politeness has a very important role to play in helping to prevent the marginalisation of minority groups .When one uses a racial slur or makes a reference to gender even in a joking manner , it helps to reaffirm the idea that the targeted minority group is \" different \" and \" separate \" from the dominant group .The perpetuation of this meme slowly results in these groups being treated separately and , ultimately , in forming their own insular cultures .Division is not in the best interests of any nation , and the promotion of unity is a very important aim of politeness .This does not at all imply that free speech out to be stifled or that certain ideas must become off limits : indeed , history has shown time and time again that attempting to legislate this sort of thing is rarely effective .However , even the most scientifically dynamic of societies have had standards of politeness that do not infringe upon their ability to research and speak .In the United States , most speech is protected under the Bill of Rights , and it is social mores that create an atmosphere of \" political correctness \" .In this view , however , political correctness ( far from being the antithesis of freedom of speech ) becomes the realisation of freedom of speech .I personally wholeheartedly agree that any person ought to be able to make whatever racial slur he or she wishes .However , is it not equally important that the people around that person be able to then register their displeasure , either through speech of their own or through \" voting with their wallets \" ?I should note that both people in my scenario are presently free under our society to execute their respective actions .Furthermore , the definition of \" political correctness \" itself can be somewhat confusing for a debate such as this .So long as free speech rights are protected , is it not \" politically correct \" to be railing against the \" politically correct \" ?By using a definition of \" political correctness \" that encompasses anything that anybody may be offended by , the definition becomes too wide and loses its power to describe society .Thus , what we see is that politeness in general serves an important function in promoting social stability without at all sacrificing the ability of society to move forward in freedom and liberty .Indeed , we see that exercise of political correctness is an affirmation of freedom itself .As well , many definitions of \" political correctness \" are too broad and become useless in discussion .Thank you for your arguments , first off you brought up , \" In the face of all this , the charge that political correctness is somehow cultural \" Marxism \" appears to be quite irrelevant\"\"There have always been \" taboo \" topics ... \" .It [ PC ] was developed at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt , Germany , which was founded in 1923 and came to be known as the \" Frankfurt School .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.997246"}

{"text":"Burkett does n't even acknowledge that among the people fighting gender stereotypes , there have been , and still are , cis men .In any case , Burkett posits that cis women own feminism , and they have the right and the power to decide whether to admit trans people .Burkett has positioned herself as having the right to decide who is acknowledged as a woman , or as a feminist , or as having a \" real \" gender identity .Fortunately , Burkett and her fellow TERFs do not in fact get to own feminism or to set the rules for gender authenticity .All of us are collectively involved in these projects , and the number of us coming out under the trans umbrella is rapidly expanding .The number of young cis people who are trans allies has been expanding in the same way .Burkett and her ilk can make our lives more painful and difficult , but they ca n't make us disappear .What Does Burkett Want ?The really ironic thing is that trans advocates share a good deal of what Elinor Burkett at least claims that she wants .And that is that we agree that confining people to gender stereotypes is bad , that gender roles are socially constructed and change over time , and that we can and should work to change things about contemporary gender norms because they disadvantage women , cis and trans .As I 've noted , the percentage of trans people who agree with this is higher than the percentage of cis people who do .This one a lot of people might just shrug at , but that I reject .I am intersex by birth .It 's vital to me that we stop naturalizing the idea that sex is a binary , when it is a spectrum .It 's important that we acknowledge the medical violence done to thousands of intersex children every year , in an attempt to make our sex variant bodies conform to this ideology .And it 's high time we stopped putting imposed gender markers on birth certificates , as we 've stopped having doctors chose a race marker for birth certificates .Burkett wants us to acknowledge the social construction and cultural variability of gender , but denies that sex is socially constructed and culturally variable .This betrays an ignorance not just of intersex experience , but of the fact that many world societies have divided the sex spectrum into three or more sexes , and that the binary sex system we see as natural is in fact ideological , only one system among many .It seems to me that what Burkett really wants is to stop the progress in social acceptance trans people have been winning , at least in more progressive social circles , by framing trans people -- especially trans women -- as regressive and antifeminist .I do n't know what motivates her to want to do this any more than I understand what motivates any sort of bigotry .Usually there 's some combination of personal insecurity and a fear that one is losing social power .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"94.47928"}

' books for fourth graders .This was a great introduction in the Civil Rights movement .My only complaint about this particular book was that all of the pictures were sketch drawings .I thought it would have been much more powerful for kids to see actual pictures .It was a biography of Martin Luther king Jr.They told about his life and what he did .I liked how they told about his life so it was n't boring .They had many thing that were not just about his life like marches and it had facts about civil rights movement .They told me new things about his death that I did n't know before .I liked that even though it was a short book it had many interesting facts .The book would be great for people who want to know more about him .I enjoyed this book and think its a great children 's book .It is easy for children to be able to read and understand this story .This is something I think is essential for children to know and be able to understand about history .I like that the illustrations were in black and white because then it did n't take too much away from the story .I would recommend this book to kids around age 10 .This is the story of Martin Luther King Jr , his life and contribution to the world .It is a story that ever I enjoyed this book and think its a great children 's book .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.52519"}

{"text":"Although the concept is gaining in popularity as many people born during the Jones timeframe feel it resonates with them , I wonder if the concept really has much value .The dates I mention on this blog for the timing of generations is drawn from the work of Neil Howe and William Strauss , who are well known for their work on generations .Their landmark book \" The Fourth Turning \" gives clear definitions of the cycle of generations and how they have evolved in the US over the last 500 years ( going back to England ) .The value of their research is partially in understanding our personal roots ( \" Oh , now I understand why my Boomer friend acts like that ... \" ) but more importantly in understanding the direction of our society overall .My question about Generation Jones ( and other divisions ) is whether it helps in that effort or just confuses .Here is a chart showing the roll of generations since 1900 ( click on it for a bigger version ) :According to Howe and Strauss , the marks between each generation are very clear and are based on their surveys of people born in these years .Each generation has a specific character , and these are shown on the chart by the various colors ( the \" archetype \" for each of these generations is shown in the legend on the right ) .The concept is that , for the most part , each generation is about 20 years ( give or take ) and they follow each other in a specific pattern ( Hero , Artist , Prophet , Nomad and so on ) .This pattern has ( mostly ) held true for the last 500 years of history , although some of the timeframes vary by a few years .If you accept this theory , at least in part , it allows you to extrapolate into the future based on the ages and attitudes of the generations that will be alive .I go into this concept further in my two presentations on turnings and generations ( Part 1 and Part 2 ) .But it does seem fairly unlikely that EVERYONE born in 1961 would have an \" X \" attitude when compared with EVERYONE born in 1960 , who would have a \" Boomer \" attitude .But I do n't think that is the point .Let 's look at an analogy .In 1984 Ronald Reagan won a landslide victory in the race for the Presidency against Walter Mondale .Mondale got only 13 Electoral votes vs. 525 for Reagan , in what , I believe was the most lopsided victory in US History .But what was the Popular vote ?The result was around 59 % to 41 % .Again a strong majority , but it does mean that over 37 Million people wanted Mondale to be president .Without going into how silly our electoral system is , I think there is a parallel to how we perceive the change in generations .Let 's look at that chart again , but this time with Generation Jones put on top to show the span of years .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.67358"}

{"text":"TEXAS FAITH : Why are millennials dropping out ?In this piece for Politics Daily , the Dallas Morning News ' Jeff Weiss did some digging into a Pew Center report about the religious identity of \" millenials , \" which is the name for those Americans who are younger than 30 .Weiss picked up first on this part of the report : . \" Fewer young adults belong to any particular faith than older people do today .They also are less likely to be affiliated than their parents ' and grandparents ' generations were when they were young .Fully one - in - four members of the Millennial generation - so called because they were born after 1980 and began to come of age around the year 2000 - are unaffiliated with any particular faith .Indeed , Millennials are significantly more unaffiliated than Generation Xers were at a comparable point in their life cycle ( 20 percent in the late 1990s ) and twice as unaffiliated as Baby Boomers were as young adults ( 13 percent in the late 1970s ) .\"But then he noted this seemingly contradictory finding : . \"Young adults ' beliefs about life after death and the existence of heaven , hell and miracles closely resemble the beliefs of older people today .Though young adults pray less often than their elders do today , the number of young adults who say they pray every day rivals the portion of young people who said the same in prior decades .And though belief in God is lower among young adults than among older adults , Millennials say they believe in God with absolute certainty at rates similar to those seen among Gen Xers a decade ago .\" Weiss then reaches this conclusion : .Which says to me that young adults are not losing faith , just unplugging from religious institutions at a rate unprecedented in U.S. history .One theory that has been advanced is that the disengagement has to do with the entanglement of conservative politics with religion .Weiss , for example , cites the work of Harvard professor Robert Putnam and Notre Dame professor David Campbell .They claim in a study that : .In the 1990s many people who had weak attachments to religion and either moderate or liberal political views found themselves at odds with the conservative political agenda of the Christian Right and reacted by renouncing their weak attachment to organized religion . \"So , with that setup , here 's this week 's question : .That 's their take ?What is yours ?Assuming the Pew Center data is correct , why are young adults unplugging from religious institutions at such a high rate ?Read on for our panelists ' thoughts .Christianity has become a commodity in our society ; one product in a wide range of possibilities for consumers seeking fulfillment in life .This represents a significant shift from previous centuries .Worship styles serve as one great example of this consumer shift .Forty years ago the vast majority of Christians worshipped in a service conducted predominantly in Latin .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"97.032616"}
