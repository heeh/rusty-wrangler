Bush in 2004 ) .None of the potential Republican candidates has yet declared he ( or she ) is in the running .None can boast to match the \" beauty \" of Trump , who ranks 488 on Forbes magazine 's 2010 list of the world 's billionaires with an estimated net worth of $ 2 billion .If he did run , he could afford the $ 600 million he is talking about .In a series of television interviews , Trump has said he would make a decision in June .Whether he runs or not , the total candidates will spend for 2012 is almost certain to top the $ 1.6 billion raised for the 2008 elections .One might expect that sums of that magnitude would prompt grumbles from an electorate grappling with unemployment and foreclosures but the subject of campaign finance reform has rarely stirred widespread interest .That ca n't be said of statements Trump has been making over the past three weeks , when he became the most prominent American to give credence to the views held by the diverse community known as \" birthers \" .They are Americans who insist - in the face of much evidence to the contrary - that Obama was born in Kenya , his father 's native country , not the United States , and therefore his presidency is illegitimate .The logic that underpins this belief implies an intricate intercontinental conspiracy in 1961 to get a Hawaii hospital to certify a birth and two newspapers to publish notices of birth .\" If he was n't born in this country , which is a real possibility , then he has pulled one of the greatest ever con tricks , \" Trump said on April 10 .He went on to assure television viewers that \" this country is going to hell , \" the world was laughing at the United States , and the country was no longer respected .Not to worry , though .If he were elected , \" I would run a great , great country ...They ( the world ) wo n't be laughing if I 'm president . \"Among the reasons : \" I happen to be smart , I happen to have a lot of common sense , I happen to know what I 'm doing . \" LUNATIC FRINGE OR MAINSTREAM ?","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"60.42728"}

{"text":"( Admittedly , the affair made the paper only after the ex - governor threatened to shoot Conkling in a Narragansett clam joint . )In 1884 , editorialists famously taunted presidential candidate Grover Cleveland about having sired a child with the unmarried Maria Halpin .The intrusions did not abate after his election , as Cleveland discovered with the frenetic coverage of his marriage in 1886 to Frances Folsom , the 21-year - old daughter of a late friend , for whom he had once bought a baby carriage .Cleveland and other politicians objected to such journalistic encroachments , but they were n't merely being self - interested .As Rochelle Gurstein notes in The Repeal of Reticence , intellectuals such as E. L. Godkin and Henry James also recoiled from the rude newspapering of the Gilded Age , and some began to speak about a \" right to privacy . \"\" Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life , \" they wrote . \"To satisfy a prurient taste the details of sexual relations are spread broadcast in the columns of the daily papers .\" Brandeis and Warren were swimming against the tide of history .Indeed , Brandeis himself later became a leading champion of the view that newspapers had not just a right but a duty to expose secrets , writing that \" sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants \" for the shadowy doings of Big Business .He would go on to formulate an expansive and influential interpretation of the First Amendment .This conflict in Brandeis 's thought underscores the dual nature of the concept of exposure , which - then as now - could describe either a salutary revelation of wrongdoing or an invasion of the personal domain .It was no coincidence that in the Progressive era , the muckraking of investigative journalists such as Lincoln Steffens and Ray Stannard Baker thrived alongside the sensationalism of William Randolph Hearst .E ven as exposure became enshrined as a progressive principle , however , political sex stories went into eclipse .After the Cleveland coverage , no sex scandal involving a politician of that stature would grace the front pages for a century .This was n't for lack of opportunity .In 1915 , Woodrow Wilson , a recent widower , conducted a passionate courtship of Edith Galt from the White House .But while Washington insiders gossiped - one joke had it that when Woodrow proposed , Edith was so surprised that she fell out of bed - the public remained unaware of the liaison until the engagement was announced .Warren Harding 's extramarital exertions would provoke titters only after his death , when a tell - all memoir by one of his mistresses , Nan Britton , boasted of assignations in a White House cloakroom .Franklin D.

{"text":"The principles I have enunciated suggest that courts would have admitted the evidence .Certainly there was no settled practice of exclusion .Note the appealing structure of Confrontation Clause doctrine that can emerge from the principles that I have enunciated : The accused forfeits the confrontation right if he commits serious misconduct that can be reasonably expected to , and does , cause the unavailability of the witness .But the accused should not be deemed to have caused that unavailability to the extent that the state could , by reasonable measures , preserve confrontation notwithstanding the accused 's wrongdoing .Putting aside waiver and forfeiture - not really exceptions to the right , but rather qualifications on its exercise , ones that apply to other Sixth Amendment rights as well - there are no exceptions to the confrontation right .Now compare the structure that apparently emerges given the result in Giles : The accused forfeits the confrontation right if he engages in conduct that is designed to , and does , render the witness unavailable .But if the accused engages in serious intentional misconduct without a purpose to render the witness unavailable , the facts that the misconduct did in fact make her unavailable , and that this was entirely predictable , do not lead to forfeiture .Apart from forfeiture doctrine , there is an exception to the confrontation right for declarations made in the anticipation of imminent death .The reason this exception is recognized - without any basis for it in the text of the Confrontation Clause - is that it was extant at the time the Sixth Amendment was adopted .( The Court offers no other reason . )The fact that the principal reason given for it at that time - that such statements are highly reliable because of the imminence of death - conflicts squarely with the essence of Crawford is of no apparent concern .This strikes me as originalism gone way overboard .As I have said , my argument accounts for the results of all the cases .It varies from the language and stated rationale of the old cases .Put another way : Crawford did to prior doctrine exactly what I am saying the Court should have done to the old cases - articulate a different and far more satisfactory rationale that is consistent with at least most of the results .The Supreme Court decided Giles v.

'We aggregated reports of specific incidents experienced or witnessed by each respondent in the settlement .We defined sexual victimization as including rape , sexual assault , acts of sexual molestation such as insertion of foreign objects into the genital opening or anus , and sexual slavery .These are constituent elements of mass rape .Four percent of the full sample and seven percent of women refugees reported personal sexual victimization , which corresponds closely to reported prevalence of this victimization in other conflict zones such as Sierra Leone .Nearly a third of the Darfur refugees ( 29.1 % ) indicated that other villagers beyond themselves were sexually victimized during attacks .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.38623"}

{"text":"( c )There were many murder cases in which that condition was not satisfied , and the statement was not admitted unless it satisfied the dying declaration exception .( d ) Until relatively recently forfeiture doctrine was not applied absent that condition .I have offered , in my amicus brief and in a prior posting on this blog , an argument that I believe completely and adequately responds to this line of reasoning .The state did not endorse it , presumably because it did not like the long - term implications .Justice Scalia never addressed the argument .Briefly , the argument is this : .The dying declaration exception should be regarded as a manifestation of forfeiture doctrine , limited by the principle that the state can not invoke forfeiture doctrine if it has not taken advantage of reasonable opportunities to preserve the confrontation right in whole or in part .When a lingering murder victim made an accusatory statement , it was standard practice to bring the accused to the victim , and take the victim 's testimony , under oath and in the presence of the accused .If the testimony of such a victim was taken without the presence of the accused , it would not be admitted .But if the victim was , and appeared to be , on death 's door , then the testimony of the victim could be admitted even though the accused was not present .So the results of these cases are in accord with the following principles : .( 1 )The accused forfeits the confrontation right with respect to testimonial statements by the victim by murdering her .( 2 ) Notwithstanding ( 1 ) , if the state can reasonably arrange for testimony by the victim subject to confrontation , but it does not do so , then it can not invoke forfeiture doctrine .( 3 ) If death is , or appears to be , imminent , then it is no longer reasonably practical and humane to provide for testimony subject to confrontation , and so the absence of confrontation is excused .I do n't believe a single one of the old cases cited in the course of briefing and arguing Giles is inconsistent with this set of principles .In a case in which the victim makes the statement at issue after the fatal blow , but the accused has had no opportunity for confrontation , then principle ( 2 ) would prevent admission of the statement unless the circumstances satisfying principle ( 3 ) are present .But Giles fits a different mold .In cases like Giles , the victim makes a testimonial statement against the accused before the crime being charged , and then is murdered ; in Giles , there was no opportunity after the fatal blow to arrange for confrontation .Cases fitting that mold apparently did n't arise in the Framing era - none of the litigants or amici cited such a case .The reason is simple .Domestic violence short of death generally was n't prosecuted .A victim of domestic violence who was not likely to die as a result of the wounds already suffered had no occasion to make a testimonial statement of the type that Brenda Avie , Giles 's victim , did .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"98.895065"}

{"text":"Sometimes , witnesses may be hypnotized before trial to help them remember past events 7 .Whether hypnotically induced witness testimony is admissible varies by jurisdiction 8 .Some jurisdictions take the position that hypnosis - induced testimony is always allowed ; other jurisdictions go to the opposite extreme and never allow hypnosis - induced testimony 9 .In other jurisdictions , licensed psychologists are allowed to hypnotize witnesses to help them recall forgotten memories , but the witness must disclose that their memory has been hypnotically enhanced 10 .This is why I think that people implanted with memory enhancing technology before becoming witnesses will have to disclose their implant before testifying at trial .Additionally , there must be other collaborating evidence that tends to prove the recalled memory is accurate , existed before the hypnosis , and is reliable 12 .These last requirements are usually determined by the jury ( or judge , during a non - jury trial ) which , as stated above , is not necessarily very good at determining reliable memories from unreliable ones .Substantively , I suspect that whether testimony from witnesses with memory enhancing implants is allowed will depend in large part on how secure the implants are .If the implant can only aid a person in recalling their own memories , and does so flawlessly ( or nearly so ) , then the courts are more likely to allow the testimony . \"13 Further , is n't it likely that people getting implants are more likely to want to introduce information that they never knew , particularly if that information can lead to new knowledge and skills a la The Matrix ?Additionally , new technology rarely works flawlessly , or even nearly so .The first implants are likely to have the same sort of bugs that plague other technology .These considerations could affect the validity of recalled memories and therefore the admissibility of the witnesses ' testimony .Because hypnosis suffers from similar problems and is , at least in most jurisdictions , admissible in some degree I do n't see this sort of memory enhancing technology being barred from the court room , even if it can be tampered with or does n't work perfectly .The enhanced accuracy ought to lead to more weight being placed on the testimony , putting away more criminals and keeping more innocent defendants out of prison .And that , we can all agree , is a good thing .Author .John Niman is a second year law student at the William S.

{"text":"This has meant that development of the surveys have relied on qualitative information in order to identify and to capture key indicators .For example , knowing that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Mai Mai culture required a cleansing ceremony of males following a sexual act revealed that female Mai Mai combatants were responsible for a portion of sexual and gender based violence in that area .Through their methodology they therefore discovered that , not only men , but also women are perpetrators of sexual violence in conflict and that not only women and girls are victims of such crimes , but also men and boys , and came up with shocking percentages .Although this phenomenon was not completely unknown , the scope of the problem was and now requires rethinking when it comes to health care , policy , guidelines for responses to gender based violence , advocacy , but also investigation and prosecution of these crimes .11 As Lawry and colleagues noted , \" Qualitative interviews provide insight into the individual 's experience of human rights abuses and thereby offer the human face and voice to the statistical numbers that are obtained from quantitative work .\" 12 Qualitative and quantitative data therefore play essential and complementary roles in providing evidence of sexual violence crimes , according to the researchers .This form of evidence - based documentation has been important in placing rape within an overall group dynamic of violence and has helped to overcome the assumption that acts of sexual violence committed during wartime necessarily follows orders or directions from higher authorities .Lawry , Johnson , and Asher caution that rape during conflict can be committed by anyone and at anytime and therefore should be searched for more broadly beyond a chain of command .Opportunistic sexual violence can come from higher levels of authority but under different liability whereby leaders create opportunity to use sexual violence either by setting an example or by simply allowing sexual violence to happen without punishment .13 As Reis pointed out , data is derived from and corroborated by individual testimonies , aggregated data , and wider population - based surveys .Depending on the initial purpose for gathering the data , it may not be immediately applicable to a judicial proceeding so that the significance and appropriate use of such data also needs to be well understood .The question therefore remains how these statistical analyses can be used for international criminal prosecution ?We need descriptive statistics to show that the crime is grave , that its scope warrants the International Criminal Court , which intends to take only the most serious cases . \" 15 Agirre Aranburu reminds us that pattern evidence has been used to investigate large - scale killings , destruction , and displacement , but much less for sexual violence .In order to use statistical evidence in a legal proceeding , such evidence must thus follow methodologies accepted by the scientific community , be subject to peer review , and be properly sourced and justified .In a way , these analyses build forth on earlier applied approaches in court , such as the so - called OTP Rape Database before the ICTR .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"111.00571"}
{"text":"Contemporary war crimes tribunals have also successfully prosecuted rape crimes without relying on the testimony of direct victims of the crimes .For example , in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ( ICTR ) , the \" Military I \" case , against military chief Colonel Bagosora , and three other military leaders , was pursued without direct rape victim testimony .Of the 242 witnesses heard by the Trial Chamber , only one , Witness DAZ , testified about her own sexual violence .Nonetheless , in court the prosecution asked most witnesses , including UN officials and human rights and women 's rights experts , whether they had seen or heard of sexual violence .Many witnesses testified about knowledge of or eye - witness to sexual violence , which has been found to have been part of the genocide in Rwanda , committed on both a widespread and systematic basis .Some witnesses were also asked about any linkage testimony of the accused to any of the rapes .Nonetheless , it should be emphasized that to constitute rape as a crime against humanity , rape itself does not need to be widespread or systematic , but it must form part of either a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population .Thus , rape does not need to be \" massive \" to constitute a crime against humanity .Testimony from independent , impartial observers can be extremely powerful .For example , Major Brent Beardsley , the assistant to Romeo Dallaire , the commander of the UN 's peacekeeping force in Rwanda during the genocide , testified in the Bagosora case .When asked about female corpses , and any observations he may have had about them , Beardsley replied : .Yes , two things , really .One , when they killed women it appeared that the blows that had killed them were aimed at sexual organs , either breasts or vagina ; they had been deliberately swiped or slashed in those areas .I 'm talking girls as young as six , seven years of age , their vaginas would be split and swollen from obviously multiple gang rape , and then they would have been killed in that position .So they were laying in a position they had been raped ; that 's the position they were in .Rape was one of the hardest things to deal with in Rwanda on our part .It deeply affected every one of us .Massacres kill the body .Rape kills the soul .And there was a lot of rape .It seemed that everywhere we went , from the period of 19th of April until the time we left , there was rape everywhere near these killing sites .In the judgment of the Military I trial , Colonel Bagosora was found guilty of , among other convictions , rape as a crime against humanity , for sexual violence committed by his subordinates .The court found him criminally responsible for failing in his duty to prevent , halt , or punish these crimes .It is unclear whether rape victims were able and willing to testify against these accused , but were not called by the prosecution to give evidence at trial .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"113.76818"}
