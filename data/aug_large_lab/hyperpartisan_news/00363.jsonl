{"text":"The problem is we can never know immediately if the information is good or bad .It has to be verified by some other way because people will do anything to stop the torture .Therefore , the ticking bomb rationale is pointless .Even if there is a ticking bomb , the person being tortured only has to hold out until the bomb explodes .Then there are those people who are frightened and want revenge , which stems from a feeling of helplessness .They - whoever they are - hurt us , and someone needs to pay for it by being hurt .I understand that thinking , but it does n't change the first point - that torture does not work reliably .Jimmy the Dhimmi .The question now ... will we learn ?The answer ?Yes .Obama has learned to step up the rendition program whereby prisoners are sent to other countries for interrogation , out of the jurisdiction of constitutional law .He has learned to modify the program so that suspects detained in Pakistan , Afghanistan , Iraq ect . are immediately handed over to the host countries for interrogation without bringing them to a secret CIA prison first .And of course , Obama has learned that the mainstream press has his back , and simply wo nt bring this up in a press conference with Gibbs or on the nightly news .After all , the New York times assures us that there will be more \" oversight , \" without giving a single detail about what that means , other than \" diplomatic assurances \" .Gerry and Mike , do you ever wonder why you must insist that everyone who has a more nuanced view on coercive interrogation than you MUST simply be basing their viewpoint on sadism or a desire for revenge ?It seems you do n't dare confront the possibility that information from terrorists might be gained from such interrogation .It frightens you that much that you have to build such flimsy straw men .The whole crux of your argument , however , relies on the assumption that waterboarding , or other harsh interrogation techniques used by the CIA have never worked , ever , and therefore there can be no practical justification at all .A more poignant entry point into this debate would be the one I emphasised above , which you are deliberately avoiding .Jimmy : .Effectiveness is irrelevant .I do n't know where the hell Americans like you came from , Jimmy .I think there 's something dark and sick in your heads and you should ask yourselves if effectiveness is your only rule then what is to stop skinning these captives alive ?Is there any limit on the evil you will endorse ?If the USA is about torture then the USA is n't worth saving .if effectiveness is your only rule then what is to stop skinning these captives alive ?Is there any limit on the evil you will endorse ?No .Just waterboarding .Sexual humiliation would be acceptable , maybe lying to them or firing a gun at them too ( intentionally missing of course ) .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"85.77887"}

{"text":"Ethernet would languish mostly inside Xerox and at a few universities for a decade after its invention : the PC era 's beginning saw Novell 's networking system became the dominant player inside businesses ( even ahead of Microsoft ) .In the mean time ( circa 1980 or so )Tom Truscott invented the Usenet .Access to the ARPANET was limited to a small number of players involved in defense contracting - this left other universities out of the picture .Truscott seized upon the idea of the ARPANET and figured out how to make it work with UUCP ( Unix - to - Unix copy program ) .UUCP was part of the standard Bell Labs ( another private institution ) unix distribution and it allowed a system administrator to set up late - night unattended copies of files between systems over modem connections .Truscott figured out how to use this to support email .While Ethernet languished Usenet flourished .In the mid 1970 's the notion of the TCP / IP protocol was developed ( as describe by Ars ) .However , this was a software protocol designed to run on packet - switched networks ( ARPANET as an example ) .And while today 's Internet uses TCP / IP the protocol runs on ethernet which is not a packet switching protocol .In the 1970 's Bill Joy at the University of California Berkeley developed what became known as BSD : Berkeley Standard Distribution .This was his version of Unix that incorporated much software developed by his group including an implementation of TCP / IP .TCP / IP was a complex undertaking because of how packets and datagrams are handled .Basically nodes in a TCP / IP network need to handle \" partial \" packets as data is moved from point to point and , as far as I know , the Berkeley BSD TPC / IP version was the first written for Unix which was accessible to the public at large .Again , outside universities and private companies this languished throughout the 1980 's .Also during the 1980 's SGML ( Standard GML ) became an ISO standard .SGML was a precursor to HTML and XML developed from IBM 's GML .SGML was developed as a means for creating documentation that a variety of systems could view , i.e. , a standardized way to indicating bold , italic , paragraphs , and so on that could be displayed on any SGML viewer .( Mary LaPlante , someone who I worked with at Unilogic , Ltd. for many years became head of the industry SGML group . )SGML 's primary issue was that a viewer was very complex and not easy to implement .There were also many companies at CMU during this time that built software and tools that used hypertext links - this was a common idea at the time .Some with SGML - others with proprietary versions .Many ran as private business - most often involved in corporate training .This left SGML as a mostly defense / aerospace standard for documenting things like airplanes and weapons systems .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"125.26196"}
