Bush , and Obama and Hillary Clinton .All of a sudden , Donald Trump has signed a pledge not to run independently , and to back whoever wins the Republican Presidential nomination .Anyone who believes he will keep his word is naive and delusional , as it is only a pledge for now since Trump is leading in all public opinion polls and could mount an independent campaign with his own money , a la Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996 .Perot well knew he could not win as an Independent , but ran anyway , and helped Bill Clinton in both elections .This time , ironically , a Trump independent candidacy would insure that Hillary Clinton , or possibly Joe Biden or even Bernie Sanders , would win .If one holds his or her breath hoping that Trump will be loyal to his pledge , think again and start breathing !The nativism and racism of Donald Trump is the greatest we have seen in American politics on the national level since Pat Buchanan ran for President in 1992 , 1996 , and 2000 .Trump has gone out of his way to insult Mexican Americans in particular , and Hispanics - Latinos in general , and has gained 20 - 30 percent support in the various polls .Now he has gone further and insulted Asian Americans , mimicking the way they speak English .He has gained a lot of support from Southern states in polls for these controversial statements and nativist attacks .In so doing , he has insured that the Republican Party can not win much of a percentage of either Hispanics - Latinos or the Asian American vote , and without it , they can not win the Presidency .But also , neo Nazi , white supremacist , and Confederate groups are rushing to support Trump , and his reaction has been quite tepid , to say the least .With these elements , there is also , and worrisome , a large element of anti Semitism , a reality in the past for Buchanan and Duke that is well known , and has been again stated by Duke explicitly in his recent unasked for endorsement of Trump .With three Republican Presidential candidates for 2016 being \" non politicians \" , people who have never served in a government position on the city , state or national level , the issue arises : have there been any other such candidates in the past ?","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"60.683876"}

W. Bush was in a tough race against Bill Clinton , and there was active discussion regarding whether to replace Vice President Dan Quayle on the ticket .In an oral history , James Baker - who ran Bush 's presidential campaigns - alluded to Ford 's decision as one reason why Bush decided to keep Quayle on the ticket .Baker was asked whether Bush regretted choosing Quayle as Vice President in the first place .He replied : \" Maybe later .Maybe later , because the coverage was so uniformly negative for the four years that I think he would 've been pleased perhaps even to see Dan volunteer to step down in ' 92 , but that was n't to be .And he certainly could n't take the ax to him because the press would say , Hey , you dummy , the problem is not the Vice President .It 's you .That 's why you 're running low in the polls .So he could n't do that .In fact I think [ Gerald ] Ford made a mistake when he let [ Nelson ] Rockefeller go .And if it had been Ford and Rockefeller , I think they would 've won that election in ' 76 , instead of Ford and Dole . \"So Bush stuck with Quayle - and lost anyway , in large part because Ross Perot 's third party candidacy siphoned votes from Bush .Despite the negative outcome , Baker 's reasoning still seems to me to be applicable to Obama 's predicament today .He ca n't fire Biden without signaling that he knows his reelection is in doubt .And it would be even more difficult to replace Biden with Clinton for the simple reason that half of the likely Democratic voters are going to want the ticket reversed , with Clinton on the top .Now , if Biden \" volunteers \" to step down , as Rockefeller did , that may ease Obama 's problem superficially , although even then there will be the inevitable whispering campaign that Biden was asked to resign .And I doubt Joe , who undoubtedly has his own eye on the presidency , wants to endure the public humiliation and long - term political repercussions from being forced from the ticket after one term .There 's a final reason why I think the Clinton - for - VP proposal is a bad idea : it does nothing for her .She 's played the loyal soldier admirably for three years now , largely staying above the political fray and garnering strong approval ratings in the process .Why jeopardize her political rehabilitation for second billing on the Democratic ticket ?If she 's going to get down into the political mud to save the party and risk tarnishing her reputation , it makes far more sense to do so for the ultimate prize : the presidency , rather than taking a backseat to Obama for four more years .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"75.65578"}

Andrew Jackson of Tennessee ran for president against the caucus system .And Jackson had climbed from childhood poverty to become a very wealthy landowner and slaveholder .A man of common birth who 'd succeeded in war and real estate deserved a shot at replacing those upper - class twits who 'd lost control of the economy , members of the elite like House Speaker Henry Clay of Kentucky -- and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams .In 1824 , both Clay and Adams , like Sen. Jackson , saw the opportunity to put an end to King Caucus ' selection of presidents , and each saw his own best chance at the presidency .According to Congressional Quarterly 's Presidential Elections Since 1789 : .\" When the electoral votes were counted , Jackson had 99 , Adams 84 , Crawford 41 , and Clay 37 .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"81.83873"}

'\" The heart of his program consisted of drastic tax cuts for the wealthy and eliminating taxes on income from profits for more than 100,000 Kansas businesses .No other state had gone this far .He was advised by the godfather of supply - side economics himself , the Reagan - era economist Arthur Laffer , who described the reforms as \" a revolution in a cornfield . \" Not surprisingly , things have not worked out well in a state run based upon far right wing principles : .By June of 2014 , the results of Brownback 's economic reforms began to come in , and they were n't pretty .During the first fiscal year that his plan was in operation , which ended in June , the tax cuts had produced a staggering loss in revenue - $ 687.9 million , or 10.84 percent .According to the nonpartisan Kansas Legislative Research Department , the state risks running deficits through fiscal year 2019 .Moody 's downgraded the state 's credit rating from AA1 to AA2 ; Standard & Poor 's followed suit , which will increase the state 's borrowing costs and further enlarge its deficit .Brownback had also promised that his tax cuts would vault Kansas ahead of its higher - taxed neighbors in job growth , but that , too , failed to happen .In Kansas , jobs increased by 1.1 percent over the last year , compared with 3.3 percent in neighboring Colorado and 1.5 percent in Missouri .From November to May , Kansas had actually lost jobs , and the labor participation rate was lower than when Brownback took office .The cuts did not necessarily slow job growth , but they clearly did not accelerate it .And the effects of Brownback 's education cuts were also glaring larger class sizes , rising fees for kindergarten , the elimination of arts programs , and laid - off janitors and librarians .This is not to say that Kansas will support liberal Democrats , but as Sean Sullivan argued on Friday , the state may be more moderate than meets the eye .Or perhaps they are just sane enough to recognize failed policies .Hopefully this will overcome any temptation to cast a vote against Obama as many in red states are likely to do .It continues to look like Kansas might have a bearing on which party controls the Senate .As I previously discussed , with the Democratic candidate dropping out of the Kansas Senate race , independent Greg Orman has a real chance of defeating Republican Pat Roberts .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"88.658905"}

Hayes .Tilden , a Democrat , won the popular vote by nearly 250,000 votes , over 3 % .On the night of the election , both candidates , as well as most of the National media , assumed Tilden was the winner .However , some Republicans were not willing to give up so easily .The candidate 's Electoral votes were close and the Republicans contested 20 of them , including 4 from Florida , 8 from Louisiana , 7 from South Carolina , and 1 from Oregon .Out of these 20 Electoral votes , Tilden only needed 1 to win the election .Hayes needed all 20 .Without any precedent for this many contested Electoral votes , both parties agreed to set up a 15 person commission to study the contested votes and to impartially decide whom each vote should go to .The commission was made up of 5 Senators , 5 members of Congress , and 5 Supreme Court Justices .It was originally set up to include 7 Democrats , 7 Republicans , and one independent who was expected to be unbiased and nonpartisan .At this time , the Republicans controlled the Senate and the Democrats controlled the House .Both parties agreed that the findings of the commission would be upheld unless overruled by both the House and the Senate .When the independent who was supposed to serve on the commission was elected as a Senator , he resigned his position on the commission and was replaced by a Republican .The commission now had 8 Republicans and 7 Democrats .Over a series of discussions , the commission voted along party lines and awarded all 20 votes to Samuel Hayes , the Republican candidate .Each vote was 8 - 7 , with the Republican majority controlling the decision .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"91.388535"}

Bush ! \"Your enthusiasm is appreciated , but the man in question is actually John Quincy Adams .Here 's another one : In this election , too , the candidate who received the most votes was denied the presidency .The electoral votes of Florida emerged as vital in determining the election 's outcome , and there arose a heated dispute as to which candidate had won Florida .In the end , they voted by a one - vote majority to give the presidency to the candidate that belonged to the same party as the purportedly neutral body that picked him .This caused a great outcry in the country , and for years after folks would call this \" the stolen election .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"109.52815"}
