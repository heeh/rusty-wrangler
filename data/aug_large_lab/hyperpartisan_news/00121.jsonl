{"text":"( Randall Benton / Sacramento ... ) .The state plan to overhaul the hub of California 's water system will cost nearly $ 25 billion to build and operate , according to preliminary figures released Wednesday .The proposal , backed by Gov. Jerry Brown 's administration and the Obama administration , calls for habitat restoration and the construction of two enormous tunnels to divert water from the Sacramento River and carry it under the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta to southbound pumps .Water users , including San Joaquin Valley irrigation districts and urban agencies in Southern California and the Bay Area , would bear roughly two - thirds of the cost , with the rest coming from federal and state sources .The proposal - in the planning stages for seven years - represents the biggest water supply project in California since the 1960s launch of the State Water Project under Brown 's father , Gov. Pat Brown .But important questions are hanging over it , in particular whether federal fishery agencies will approve operating rules that will deliver the volume of water sought by the contractors who will pay for most of the project .By building a diversion point on the river in the north delta and restoring more than 100,000 acres of habitat , the contractors hope to escape the endangered species restrictions that have reduced their water deliveries from the delta .Citing an economic analysis , state water officials said the value of benefits the project would provide outweighed costs by 35 % to 40 % .Proponents said the new diversion would improve the quality of water deliveries by taking some supplies north of tidal influences and runoff from delta farms .It would also stabilize export amounts by taking less water from the existing , fish - killing south delta facilities and make the water system less vulnerable to earthquake damage .Under the estimates released by the state , building the tunnels , three large intakes on the river and associated facilities would cost $ 14.5 billion .Operations and maintenance would amount to $ 4.8 billion over the 50-year life of the project .Habitat restoration , which would be funded with state bonds and federal appropriations , would cost $ 4.1 billion .Since most of the money would come from water users , their participation in the project is crucial .And they are reserving final commitment until still - evolving details of the plan are firmed up .\" We 've got to be able to say we can make it work under all conditions , \" said Roger Patterson , assistant general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California , which imports supplies from the delta .\" There will be some judgment as to where we think things may or may not go ....Under the worst - case scenario , does it still work for us ? \"Depending on what operating rules the fishery agencies demand to protect endangered native fish , delta deliveries could increase or decrease compared to the average of the last two decades .If they fall , the water contractors must decide if the project is worth it .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"48.698463"}

Bush came to office , the growers who had filed the lawsuit a decade earlier began pushing it again .A career Justice Department attorney , Yoshinori H.T. Himel , representing the Department of Interior and the Bureau in the grower suit , filed a motion in August of 2002 to get it dismissed .Himel pointed out that Westlands , in the 1985 agreement , had agreed \" to design , install , and operate alternative means for disposal of drain water in an efficient and environmentally sound manner . \"Himel then noted that the 1985 Agreement \" placed the obligation on Westlands \" to design , install and operate alternative means for disposal of drain water from Westlands . \"Himel said alternative means included evaporation ponds , salt tolerant crops and recycling .Himel added \" One thing the Agreement did alter , however , was Westlands ' obligation to indemnify the United States for , among other things , ' losses , damages , claims and liabilities ' arising from Westlands ' performance or non - performance of the Agreement .A federal court rejected this argument but critical issues of apportionment of liability for the drainage mess remained .Of course , we will never know what would have happened had the apportionment of fault issues been decided by a jury or a judge .Bennett Raley , a Colorado attorney who represented irrigation districts and was appointed Assistant Secretary for Water and Science by his Interior Secretary Gale Norton in 2001 , made sure that a trial on the merits did not happen .Raley , undoubtedly with the support of Norton and the White House , undercut Himel and other Justice Department career attorneys defending the suit , agreeing to a $ 139 million settlement in December of 2002 , with most of the money coming from U.S. taxpayers , not Westlands .Raley , of course , gained fame in 2002 for allotting water from Oregon 's Klamath River to irrigators rather than to endangered fish , leading to a massive salmon die - off .News reports later indicated Vice President Dick Cheney masterminded the Klamath decision .It is unknown if Cheney or former White House advisor mastermind Karl Rove were consulted or involved in the decision to concede victory to the Westlands growers without a court fight .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"58.738274"}

{"text":"The National Irrigation Association was founded in 1899 to press for federal legislation .In 1896 Senator Warren secured a federal reservoir survey in order to provide support for federal flood control .The survey was led by Captain Hiram Martin Chittenden of the Army Corps of Engineers .11 Chittenden visited many areas in the West to examine potential reservoir sites , and he met with leaders of the reclamation movement .His report to Congress in 1897 provided support for federal dams in some locations but not others .Irrigation advocates used a variety of arguments in favor of federal aid for dam - building .Crittenden believed that federal aid was necessary because \" private enterprise can never accomplish the work successfully .\" 12 Other advocates argued that federal dams were needed to control floods in the West .That argument was pressed after major floods occurred , such as when the Imperial Valley in California flooded in 1891 .Another argument for federal support was the view that irrigation would spur western population growth , which would be good for the whole nation .Irrigation would provide opportunities for poor Americans to gain access to land , which would decrease social unrest .This \" safety valve \" thesis was an important part of the 19th century political debate .Wesley Jones , a representative and later a senator from Washington , for example , posited that putting people on small farms in the West was good for social order because wage laborers in the East could be subject to \" anarchist disorder and revolution .\" There were some very dubious arguments in favor of federal irrigation aid .One widely believed theory was that irrigated farming would increase rainfall in formerly arid regions - rain would \" follow the plow \" it was said .That theory turned out to be false .Another argument , made by Frederick Newell , the chief hydrologist for the U.S. Geological Survey and later the first director of the Reclamation Service , was that there would be spillover effects from irrigation - irrigation from surface water would create increases in western groundwater .15 That idea is no longer supported .In 1901 Francis Newlands , a representative and later a senator from Nevada , introduced the first major legislation for federal construction of dams .The bill failed to pass , but the national mood was changing .All of the major political parties - the Democrats , Republicans , and the short - lived Silver Republicans - included support for federal irrigation in their platforms .16And by this time , the Geological Survey was preparing plans for reclamation projects at 147 specific sites .In 1902 another reclamation bill was introduced and President Theodore Roosevelt provided his strong support .The act passed easily in the Senate , but there was opposition in the House , with 146 voting in favor and 55 against it .18 Representative William Hepburn from Iowa called federal irrigation \" larceny \" because it benefited private property owners at the expense of the general public .19 Others resisted federal dam building as a step towards socialism .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"62.96196"}

Paul Douglas of Illinois - a PhD economist - lambasted these projects relentlessly when they were being considered in Congress .But in the end , the economics of the projects did n't matter , only the political drive for Reclamation to spend money in certain states did .As Reisner notes , California had won a series of big projects from Reclamation , so now it was the turn of the Upper Basin region of the Colorado River to win some .So the projects were approved , even though power production and irrigation did n't make much sense in the region .That sort of political logic was then transferred to Arizona .If California , Colorado , and other states got big projects , why should n't Arizona ?Arizona is one of the driest states in the nation , but it has groundwater sources that had long provided water for irrigation in the state .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"81.82754"}

{"text":"New \" Pork \" for the Old West .New \" Pork \" for the Old West .Senate Prepares to Give Away Federal Water Projects .March 22 , 2000 .Washington , D.C.In the long history of Western \" pork barrel \" federal water projects built to provide local benefits , the Senate is opening a new and dangerous chapter .Until now , when the federal government built the dams , reservoirs , and water systems of the West , it kept the ownership .Today , the Water and Power Subcommittee of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee considered legislation that transfers complete ownership of three Western projects to local water districts . \"Water contractors have always gotten the water , now they want the hose , \" testified Steven Malloch , Counsel for Trout Unlimited , in testimony before the Subcommittee on Water and Power . \"Federal water projects have been a disaster for the health of Western rivers , and a staple of federal ' pork barrel ' spending .Congress should not give away project ownership to further enrich water users at the expense of the taxpayer and already stressed western biological resources , \" stated Mr. Malloch of Trout Unlimited .Two of the projects reviewed at the hearing have pending acute Endangered Species Act issues .A dam and diversion on the lower Yellowstone River in Montana , trap over 500,000 fish per year , some candidates for listing under the ESA , into irrigation canals , and block spawning migrations for the pallid sturgeon , a listed species .The cost of fish passage and screens for this project is estimated at $ 5 to $ 10 million .In California 's Sierra Nevada foothills , the Sly Park project supplies water to sprawl development , jeopardizing several rare plants and the red - legged frog .Preserves for the plants and other recovery costs are estimated to cost $ 50 million .\" If the ESA problems are not solved before Congress directs the transfer of ownership , the cost of solutions will fall squarely on the taxpayers , \" noted Mr. Malloch .\" Taxpayers paid for most of the projects ' costs -- water users pay only pennies on the dollar .Now , under these bills , either the taxpayer will also pay millions for the ESA problems caused by building these projects , or the problems do n't get solved .\" Under the 1902 law setting up the Reclamation program to help settle the west , more than half of the total cost of irrigation projects were written off , or shifted to electric power users .The other half is usually paid after a 10- year grace period , over 40 years at no - interest .Municipal water supply projects are heavily subsidized as well .\" Whoever thought this one up is a genius , \" Mr. Malloch continued . \"Unlike ordinary taxpayers , the federal government does not keep track of its assets .So this gift does not show up on the books - Congress can make a gift worth millions , but it is invisible to the budget hawks .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"95.37459"}
{"text":"Selenium 's toxicity to livestock was well known and Department of Agriculture studies in 1939 had actually detected elevated levels in Fresno County 's western foothills but that information had been overlooked or ignored by Bureau officials eager to build the San Luis Unit .Many federal scientists saw Kesterson coming although they did not know that it would be selenium , not pesticides , that would cause Kesterson 's Silent Spring .Amazingly , much of the tab for constructing the Kesterson facilities was deducted from the Westlands ' repayment tab because it was designated a benefit to wildlife and the general public .The wetlands at the 5,900-acre Kesterson refuge adjacent to the San Joaquin River in Merced County were in the middle of the wintering grounds for hundreds of thousands of migratory ducks supposedly protected by an international treaty , the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act .When full strength drainwater began flowing to Kesterson in 1981 , high levels of selenium dissolved in the drainage water quickly moved into the food chain , killing fish and birds and triggering grotesque deformities in wildlife .Kesterson neighbors Jim and Karen Claus , who watched their cattle die after drinking water seeping from the evaporation ponds , filed a complaint with the regional water board and sounded the alarm .Hodel said the evaporation ponds were a violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act .A delegation of Westlands officials and growers , including former California Secretary of State Bill Jones ( Jones ' family owned several thousand acres in Westlands ) , traveled to Washington to lobby Hodel to resume irrigation deliveries .In exchange for the Bureau to continue the flow of Northern California water to Westlands , the water district officials signed an agreement on April 3 , 1985 in which they pledged to halt drainage flows to Kesterson even though this would worsen their drainage crisis .In that 1985 agreement , Westlands also assumed any liability for lawsuits from individual Westlands growers .In 1991 , some growers in a 42,000-acre area of Westlands who had originally drained their wastes to Kesterson filed suit against Westlands and the Bureau of Reclamation for damages caused when the drainage system was closed and plugged .The suit was placed on the back burner during the Clinton years , as Reclamation officials plodded along spending tens of millions of dollars on drainage studies , including a $ 50 million , five - year investigation by a state - federal team .Their report , issued in 1990 , concluded the cheapest solution was to take the high selenium lands out of production and drastically reduce the amount of drainage produced .When George W. Bush came to office , the growers who had filed the lawsuit a decade earlier began pushing it again .A career Justice Department attorney , Yoshinori H.T. Himel , representing the Department of Interior and the Bureau in the grower suit , filed a motion in August of 2002 to get it dismissed .Himel pointed out that Westlands , in the 1985 agreement , had agreed \" to design , install , and operate alternative means for disposal of drain water in an efficient and environmentally sound manner . \"","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"95.451294"}

Frazier called the findings \" particularly troubling \" because of the agency 's long - standing efforts to improve its handling of biological opinions .In May , Lecky , identified as a senior adviser for intergovernmental programs for the fisheries service , testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on the Endangered Species Act and ways to make it work more smoothly .Against the light of the inspector general 's opinion , Lecky 's testimony seemed especially compelling .In his prepared remarks , Lecky said the agency \" understands the importance of improving the quality of conclusions drawn from data used to implement the Endangered Species Act and ensuring that decisions are based on the best data available . \"\" This has proved difficult in situations where policy decisions must be made when the information is limited , \" he said .Westlands Drainage Delay No . 389 .Nearly 60 years ago the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began working on a drainage system for the problem - plagued high selenium soils of the western San Joaquin Valley .Following an hour - long hearing , Wanger granted the Westlands ' motion over the protests of the older federal irrigation districts which are downslope , and to the north , of the Westlands , which is located in western Fresno and Kings counties .To say that progress on the Westlands drainage problem has been glacial in pace would be incorrect because glaciers now are melting as fast as an Anthony Weiner underwear photo moves around the Twitter universe .So let 's just say progress , if that is what it actually is , is made at a snail 's pace and is measured in decades .To refresh your memories , in 1955 the Bureau unveiled a plan for a $ 7 million earthen canal to carry Westlands ' salt - loaded drainwater to the eastern edge of the Delta .The San Luis Unit of the federal Central Valley Project was approved by Congress in 1960 and by then a much more expensive cement - lined drain canal to the Delta was envisioned .Downslope farming interests and Delta / Bay area farming interests opposed completion of a drain to the Delta and by the mid-1970s construction of the San Luis Drain was halted in a wetlands area north of Los Banos in Merced County and evaporation ponds were built to hold the water .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"98.8002"}
