{"text":"If liberals and Democrats want to make the fight over Obamacare about taxes , spending , and the budget deficit , Republicans should allow them to do so .The public has already taken sides in this fight .Taxpaying Americans are never going to be convinced that the government has found a way to give away new benefits to millions of people , with no cost to them or anyone else .As November approaches , Obamacare 's defenders are quite plainly desperate .They see public opinion solidly against them , and a devastating election fast approaching .Their latest gambit to protect what was jammed through Congress in March is to claim that repeal would be so costly to the federal budget that it would be impossible to pass , even with overwhelming popular support .That 's the spin some on the left put on a recent letter from the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) to Senator Mike Crapo .But unfortunately for these advocates , that 's not what the CBO letter says .Moreover , enacting a real \" doc fix \" to avoid deep and unrealistic cuts in Medicare physician fees will cost another $ 300 billion or so over the coming decade .What this communication from CBO actually confirms , however , is that , contrary to White House assertions , Obamacare is a budget buster of the highest order .The claim that it would reduce the budget deficit over the coming decade has always rested on a series of gimmicks , implausible assumptions , and sleights - of - hand that have been exposed repeatedly over the past year , most especially by Congressman Paul Ryan in the presence of President Obama .Among the most egregious deceptions is the double- counting of cuts in Medicare 's reimbursement rates for hospitals and other providers of care - cuts so deep that they would push Medicare 's rates below those paid by Medicaid by the end of the decade .Even if these cuts were realistic - which they are n't - they ca n't both be used to pay for a new entitlement and to improve Medicare 's solvency , as the White House claims .The same money simply ca n't be spent twice .Moreover , this money is almost certainly never going to materialize anyway because , as Medicare 's chief actuary has warned repeatedly , they would seriously reduce access to care for seniors by driving hospitals and physicians out of the program .It is all but inevitable , therefore , that Congress will step in at some point to reverse the \" cuts , \" and probably sooner rather than later .When that happens , it will only confirm what 's already abundantly clear - that these unsustainable payment reductions should never have been allowed to grease the way for a permanent and massively expensive entitlement program .Indeed , contrary to latest spin from the left , not only would repeal not bust the budget , it would in fact produce a budgetary windfall of such enormous size that it could pay for a sensible reform of American health care and for deficit reduction too .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"33.603195"}

{"text":"However , for Congress to take the trouble , they 're going to have to hear from you all the way through the process , lest they choose the path of least resistance - that of doing nothing .ObamaCare was supposed to reduce the cost of insurance , hence the Affordable Care Act .But is this really what it did ?States with less regulations before the law was enacted had more affordable health care costs .Take , for example , North Carolina and Nevada .They saw individual premiums for people in their twenties rise over 150 percent after the law was enacted .Whew , it 's been a tough week .Looking back on the last five years and all the harm ObamaCare has done to this country is a real downer .In order to head into the weekend on a slightly lighter note , let 's conclude our series with a little frivolity , the five best quotes about ObamaCare .And the week - long spotlight on ObamaCare 's fifth anniversary keeps rolling right along !Passing the ACA was no easy feat , and Democrats had to make all sorts of outlandish promises to voters and politicians alike in order to advance the president 's government takeover of health care .One of the features of any big government program is the inevitable catering to special interests , and exemptions for well - connected parties .ObamaCare is more egregious in this regard than most laws .As the week - long mourning of ObamaCare 's five year anniversary continues , here are the five dimensions of ObamaCare 's cronyism in action .Rarely has such a major piece of legislation as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ObamaCare ) been passed in such an overwhelming partisan way .Without garnering a single Republican vote , ObamaCare was rammed down the throats of the American people , even though a majority opposed - and continue to oppose - the law .Monday marks the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act - AKA ObamaCare - being signed into law .Since that fateful day , Americans have been faced with fewer health care choices , higher prices , and burdensome mandates that have made an already tangled health care bureaucracy exponentially worse .A good law needs to be clear , concise and open to debate throughout the entire lawmaking process ; ObamaCare had none of these things .Since public opinion was opposed to ObamaCare from the start , the law was forced through Congress with no time to debate .Now , it appears to be up to the courts and executive orders to try to fix the many problems with the bill .It is difficult to predict how the Supreme Court will rule in any case it takes up , even after oral arguments ; King v. Burwell is no different .This being said , oral arguments still brought some interesting insight from the Court .While the Supreme Court is considering the King v. Burwell case about the IRS illegally funding a part of ObamaCare ( the subsidies ) , last week it was revealed that the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) has ... illegally funded another part of ObamaCare .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"47.065567"}
{"text":"Abstract : The hodgepodge of new taxes that have already or will soon take effect as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may not all show up in the income tax tables , but their huge cost is still very real .This cost will become most apparent in lost wages and international competitiveness , and it reduces middle- and low - income families ' wages just as surely as an income tax hike would .These taxes break President Barack Obama 's promise not to raise taxes on families making less than $ 250,000 per year .Now that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) of 2010 has been passed by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama , substantial tax increases can be expected in the near future .Combined , all of these tax increases ( including those on employers that do not provide health insurance for their employees and on individuals who do not buy health insurance ) will cost taxpayers $ 503 billion between 2010 and 2019 .[ 1 ] These tax hikes will slow economic growth , reduce employment , and suppress wages .Further , in an act reminiscent of George H. W. Bush breaking his \" no new taxes \" pledge in 1991 , the tax hikes in the PPACA will raise taxes on middle - income families in direct violation of President Obama 's oft - stated pledge not to do so .And by delaying the effective date for most of these new taxes , the President and Congress have shown themselves unwilling to implement these taxes on their own watch , raising doubts as to whether future Presidents and Congresses will be willing to do so .This increases even further the likelihood that this bill will substantially increase the deficit , which would break another Obama promise .Major New Tax Increases in the PPACA Three major tax increases make up a majority of new revenue in the PPACA .A new 40 percent excise tax on health insurance plans .This will apply to plans valued in excess of $ 10,200 for individuals and $ 27,500 for families .It will take effect in 2018 and is projected to raise $ 32 billion by 2019 .The PPACA could have fixed one of the health care system 's most serious flaws : the inefficient tax treatment of employer - sponsored health insurance .[ 2 ] Instead , the new excise tax will make health insurance more costly and complex , while leaving the perverse incentives and inequities of the existing system in place .In addition , this hidden tax will do nothing to make costs more transparent .Many families that make far less than $ 250,000 a year have high - end health plans and will be subject to the excise tax when it goes into effect in 2018 , breaking President Obama 's pledge not to tax these families .The threshold above which an insurance plan will be hit by the tax is indexed to increase at inflation plus 1 percent , which is below the rate of medical cost inflation .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"47.157265"}

{"text":"Alison Acosta Fraser .At first look , the budget unveiled today by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul D. Ryan ( R - WI ) advances much - needed reforms and importantly accomplishes the crucial goal of balancing the budget within the decade , though this is partially on the coattails of Obama 's tax increases .Not a silver bullet , it is more of a stasis budget , rather than a bolder plan that builds on the reforms of previous years .There are six things that each budget from the House , Senate , and President should accomplish .These are laid out in the Heritage plan , Saving the American Dream , which : .Balances the budget in less than 10 years , without raising taxes , and keeps the budget in balance thereafter ; .Swiftly overhauls entitlement programs , including Social Security , to guarantee economic security to seniors while making the programs affordable ; .Repeals Obamacare in its entirety ; .Fully funds defense ; .Rolls back discretionary spending ; and .Rolls back recent tax increases with a sweeping , growth - oriented tax reform plan and caps taxes at the historical average of 18.5 percent .Here 's how , at first blush , the Ryan plan measures up : .Gets to Balance .The Ryan budget achieves an important improvement over last year by balancing the budget within 10 years .The President 's budgets have never even attempted this , and given the Senate 's rusty skills in budget writing , it 's unlikely they would choose this course , either .The Ryan budget slows the growth of spending to about 3.4 percent per year , compared to roughly 5 percent today , with about $ 5 trillion less spending .But , regrettably , Ryan 's budget also relies on Obama 's $ 618 billion fiscal cliff tax increase and Obamacare 's $ 1 trillion in tax hikes ( more on this next ) to get to balance .This means that tax levels rise almost immediately to 19.1 percent of GDP , well over the 18.5 percent benchmark .Balance is important , but so is the size of government .Without the tax increase , this budget would have had to have been more assertive in attacking spending and reforming entitlements to achieve and sustain balance .Repeals Obamacare Spending , But Keeps the Taxes .The vital organs of Obamacare - the insurance exchange subsidies and Medicaid expansions - are scheduled to start next year .Ryan 's budget takes the correct and necessary step of repealing them .But , as noted above , perhaps the biggest shortcoming of this budget is that it keeps the tax increases associated with Obamacare .These tax hikes are the oxygen that fuels the fire of ever bigger spending .But the entire fire needs to be put out - all of Obamacare should be repealed , including its tax hikes .Defense Funding Levels Mixed .Like last year , the Ryan budget protects defense from the eviscerating sequestration cuts .This is sound .As North Korea 's posturing shows , the world is not a safer place today .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"49.3313"}

{"text":"Saving the American Dream : The Fiscal Cliff and Beyond .By Alison Acosta Fraser , William W. Beach and Stuart M. Butler , Ph.D. December 11 , 2012 .Abstract : Unless Congress and the President act promptly and wisely , sequestration under the Budget Control Act ( BCA ) will undermine military readiness , and the nearly $ 500 billion tax increase starting on January 1 , 2013 , will greatly harm an already weak economy .However , this fiscal cliff can be avoided .The key to avoiding this and future fiscal calamities is reform of the mandatory spending programs , from welfare to Social Security , that currently drive federal deficits .The Heritage Foundation 's Saving the American Dream plan would rein in spending immediately , restructure the major entitlement programs to bring entitlement spending under control over the long term , and strengthen the core foundations of these programs .Since the Heritage Foundation 's Saving the American Dream plan [ 1 ] was first published in April 2011 , there has been almost no substantive progress on spending control .The only plausible exception was the flawed Budget Control Act ( BCA ) , a product of a contentious debt limit debate .The complete failure of the resultant bipartisan \" supercommittee \" to reach agreement was a sad reflection on a Congress that is divided and unwilling to pass the legislation necessary to rein in spending .As a result , the nation is facing the looming sequester , which will further undermine the defense budget , jeopardizing one of the federal government 's core constitutional responsibilities .Yet it would leave entitlement programs virtually untouched , even though they are the largest driver of spending today and in the future .Meanwhile , the prospect of a huge tax increase in January has had a deleterious effect on the economy for many months , although the effect is only a small portion of the harm the economy will incur if the tax increase ultimately takes effect .America seriously needs a true way forward .The Heritage plan reflects the need to rein in spending immediately and to rethink major programs .Spending on the open - ended Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid entitlements must be brought under control , and the core foundations of these programs should be strengthened .The following principles guide the policy solutions in Saving the American Dream : .Total spending must be brought under control to balance the budget without raising taxes , ultimately holding revenues at their historical share of gross domestic product ( GDP ) .Entitlement programs should , unlike today , actually guarantee seniors economic security in retirement and be recast as real and sustainable insurance programs focused on those who truly need them .Other spending must be curbed , and the federal government must be restricted to its proper functions .Defense , as a core constitutional function of the federal government , should be fully funded and efficiently delivered .The tax system should be structurally reformed to foster growth by eliminating tax distortions of private economic decisions , especially decisions on savings and investment , and to make the system simpler and more transparent .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.63008"}
{"text":"[ 8 ] .The broad direction for tax reform already in play , especially the bipartisan push for lower corporate income tax rates , is fully consistent with the New Flat Tax .Congress will likely find the goal of lower corporate tax rates quickly running up against the consequent need to lower tax rates for non - corporate businesses .This occurs naturally under the New Flat Tax , which taxes all businesses at a single rate on their domestic net cash flow at the entity level .Likewise , the growing support for a territorial tax system - under which U.S. businesses are taxed solely on their domestic income - is also fully consistent with the New Flat Tax , which levies tax solely on domestic income .Under the New Flat Tax , the individual income tax and the payroll tax are rolled into one system with the same tax rate that is imposed on business income .Nearly all other federal levies are repealed , leaving a simple system for both individuals and businesses .Under the New Flat Tax as it applies to individuals , only income used for consumption is taxed , thus eliminating the existing tax bias against saving .In addition , all distorting credits , exemptions , and deductions are eliminated , leaving only two credits and three deductions .The first credit is the above - mentioned tax credit for health insurance .This tax credit is less distortive of economic decisions than current law is , but it remains a clear subsidy for the purchase of health insurance .It is necessary because the current - law tax bias favoring health insurance is so powerful and so entrenched that simply eliminating the tax advantage is impracticable .The second credit carried over from current law is the earned income credit ( EIC ) .The EIC needs reform in its own right , but it is also the largest income - support component of the overall federal anti - poverty program and one of its most effective elements .Changes in the EIC should then be considered part of the proposed budget for anti - poverty programs .The three deductions are as follows : .The deduction for charitable expense , which is retained because this tax system taxes the individual on what he or she spends .Charitable contributions benefit the receiving organization and thus should be deductible for the recipient .A deduction for higher education , which recognizes that education expenses are a form of saving and investing simultaneously , which in every other instance is excluded from tax under the New Flat Tax .An optional home mortgage deduction with the proviso that if the homeowner chooses a mortgage with deductible interest , then the lender must , as under current law , continue to pay tax on interest income earned .Alternatively , the home owner may choose to forgo the deduction , in which case the lender earns tax - free interest income and can thus charge a lower mortgage interest rate .The New Flat Tax , the tax reform plan , is implemented effective January 1 , 2014 .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.90442"}

{"text":"The Heritage plan reflects the need to rein in spending immediately and to rethink major programs .Spending on the open - ended Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid entitlements must be brought under control , and the core foundations of these programs should be strengthened .The following principles guide the policy solutions in Saving the American Dream : .Total spending must be brought under control to balance the budget without raising taxes , ultimately holding revenues at their historical share of gross domestic product ( GDP ) .Entitlement programs should , unlike today , actually guarantee seniors economic security in retirement and be recast as real and sustainable insurance programs focused on those who truly need them .Other spending must be curbed , and the federal government must be restricted to its proper functions .Defense , as a core constitutional function of the federal government , should be fully funded and efficiently delivered .The tax system should be structurally reformed to foster growth by eliminating tax distortions of private economic decisions , especially decisions on savings and investment , and to make the system simpler and more transparent .Priorities for Congress and the President .Fiscal year ( FY ) 2012 closed on September 30 with the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimating spending of $ 3.5 trillion and a deficit of $ 1.1 trillion .[ 2 ] Debt held by the public was $ 11.3 trillion ( 73 percent of GDP ) .According to the CBO , debt will explode to 199 percent of GDP by 2037 , driven by growth in spending that will reach 36 percent of GDP .[ 3 ] .The main drivers of spending and debt increases are incontrovertibly the major entitlement programs : Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid .It is clear that the top priorities for Congress and the President should be controlling spending , especially entitlement reform , and setting an economic growth agenda through tax reform .After averting the fiscal cliff , Congress and the President should immediately turn their attention to these pressing issues .As noted , entitlements are the fastest - growing programs .Even if all other spending was eliminated , these programs would still cause large and unsustainable deficits in the future .Their growth is automatic , with autopilot spending increases built in and no serious budgetary constraints .The top priority must be to restructure entitlements and put a brake on their spending levels while strengthening and preserving them for future generations .A number of robust proposals for health care reforms already exist , both in Congress and in the policy community .[ 4 ] Congress and the President should take advantage of this policy momentum and focus on reforming Medicaid and especially Medicare .However , changes in Social Security should follow quickly , and the rules that govern these programs in general should be more consistent .For example , increases in the normal eligibility age should proceed simultaneously for both Social Security and Medicare .Specific steps for Congress and the President include the following : .The President should submit a budget by the 2013 tax deadline deadline that outlines strong , sweeping changes in entitlement programs that will reduce spending over the 10-year budget window and significantly improve the long - term trajectory of these programs .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"79.92505"}
