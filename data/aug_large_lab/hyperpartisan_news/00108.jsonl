Orange Street .General Assembly Weekend Check - In .Three major , and controversial , decisions have been made in the North Carolina General Assembly this past weekend : the Senate 's new spending plan , teacher pay raises , and the fracking bill .The Senate has decided upon a new $ 21.1 billion spending plan for 2014 - 15 this weekend .Democrats were displeased with how quickly the decision was made , as it allowed for minimal negotiation .They seemed to be in consensus that the Senate was only interested in hearing their own approval , rather than the perspectives of the general public .As part of this new budget plan , legislators also desire to encourage teachers to give up their tenure in exchange for an 11 % raise in pay .Teachers , in response , are disagreeing with the motion as they desire more protection from unfriendly politics that surround schools presently .These raises are also planned to be gathered from cuts that would come from public school spending .Other states are allegedly not attempting this swap of pay raise for tenure .Democrats agree that this action is not for the benefit of the teacher 's , but more of a cover - up for legislators ' inability to manage money wisely .The fracking bill , completely supported by the House Republicans , is now on its way to be signed by Gov. Pat McCrory , who is more than ready to help get it passed .While Democrats were clearly unhappy with the bill , they failed to halt the process .Instead , they were able to add a few minor alterations to the bill as compromise before being sent to Gov. McCrory .Many North Carolinians fear what the fracking might mean for chemicals that could get into well water , as well as how the Senate now seems to have the ability to override local governments in relation to how the fracking will be carried out .As of now , there seems to be a great deal of controversy with each major decision processed by the General Assembly of North Carolina this past weekend .The uncertainty regarding the decided amount of the budget has some questioning how things are going to get better now .The risky move of raising teachers ' salaries whilst eliminating assistants and tenure is causing a rift of displeasure from educators of North Carolina , and unfavorable fracking plans that may affect local businesses in a way that they are unwilling to comply with the Senate 's decision .Local Electeds React To State Senate Budget .The North Carolina General Assembly is meeting in \" short session \" this year - but there 's been no shortness of controversy .Already facing a multi - million - dollar shortfall , officials at Chapel Hill - Carrboro City Schools say the Senate 's proposal would likely force the district to make even more cuts than they were initially planning - unless they can persuade County Commissioners to dig even deeper into the pool of local money .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"46.710403"}

{"text":"NC Approves Five Early Voting Sites For Orange County .The State Board of Elections has officially approved Orange County 's early voting sites , including one close to- but not on-UNC campus .Concerns about accessibility led members of the Orange County Board of Elections to take Ram 's Head Dining Hall off the list of possible sites this year .Board members examined other options for on - campus voting , but ultimately settled on the North Carolina Hillel Center on West Cameron Avenue .While that 's close to UNC , some worry its off - campus location will not appeal to student voters .A plan to use Cobb Residence Hall as an additional on - campus voting site failed to gain traction with the majority of the local board members .The sites approved for early voting are the Hillel Center and the Seymour Senior Center in Chapel Hill , the Board of Elections office and the Master 's Garden Preschool in Hillsborough , and Carrboro Town Hall .Recent changes to state law mean early voting will only run for nine days this year and registration during early voting is no longer allowed .The deadline to register to vote is Friday , April 11 .Reams says the state Board of Elections will approve those five sites .Though the dining hall was convenient for students , it presented several challenges , such as compliance with the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) .Reams says the North Carolina Hillel Center , located on W. Cameron St. , is more suitable for one - stop voting .\" I think the Board chose this site because if the accessibility .It is ADA accessible .It has , what we are hoping is , adequate parking .It had the best parking of the three locations that the Board was looking at , and with the bus service being right there , we just think it would be a good site . \"The Board also considered two other campus locations to replace the Ram 's Head Dining Hall- Sonja Haynes Stone Center and Cobb Residence Hall .\" That will be decided Monday by the state Board of Elections on whether or not an alternative plan will add that sixth site , which would be Cobb Residence .\" Reams says it also important for voters to pay attention to the recent changes in North Carolina 's election laws .People can not register to vote during the early voting period as they could in the past .\" If anyone wants to vote early or on election day , they need to meet that April 11 th registration deadline . \"House Bill 598 , passed by the Republican - led General Assembly last summer , shortened the early voting period from 17 to nine days .The law also requires that all early voting sites must have identical schedules and provide the option of curbside voting .For more information on Orange County 's early voting sites and their hours of operation , click here .OC Elections Board Struggles With Campus Early Voting .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"89.85163"}

{"text":"There are other bits of special pleading that people will come out with which effectively says , ' Dikkii , it is n't really ' free ' .We just use the term to sell a particular package of speech guidelines that we like and use of the word ' restricted ' is not clever marketing . 'Well , no one will use those exact words , but you get the idea .My favourite item of special pleading also comes from the States and involves that old chestnut , ' Free speech does n't mean that you can yell fire in a crowded theatre ! 'Well , yes it does , actually .Placing yet another restriction on freedom of speech , we gradually move further and further away from the dictionary definition of what ' free ' means .In its purest form , and I 'm using the Oxford here , the adjective ' free ' means : . \" ... able to act or be done as one wishes ; not under the control of another .\" I 'm sorry , but a restriction , whether it be crowded theatres or anything else , has been imposed by someone , and therefore not only can one not act ( in this case , speak ) as one wishes , someone has imposed a control .And the English language is indeed the poorer for this .It gets worse , too .Some of my old school buddies are fond of getting nice and condescending with the lovely old cliché , ' I may not agree with what you 're saying , but I 'll fight for your right to say it . 'It 's nice in theory to say that you 'll fight for someone 's right to say anything they like , but frankly , I think they 're lying out of their arses , because here are some things that they will never fight for .Not only that , but these are just some reasons why freedom of speech is completely unachievable , either in my lifetime or anyone else 's : .Contracts .Where you go to get something enforced on a contract of sale , and the person who sold you something said , ' Nah , I was just saying stuff ' , is it possible that anyone would fight for this ?Doubtful .The news .The meedja are awfully fond of attempting the free speech line , although they would never in a million years try the line that , ' No , the Prime Minister did n't really have sex on a crowded bus in front of kiddies .We made that up because it was tremendously funny , and you believed us like the gullible twats you are ! 'Peer group pressure and cultural taboos .When was the last time in any jurisdiction did anyone try to sue a group for imposing their groupthink on them ?It 's unthinkable .There are certain things that you can not say because you will be ostracised - freedom of speech means that nothing is off the table , even jokes about terrorists of particular ethnic persuasions rooting kiddies .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"140.52344"}
