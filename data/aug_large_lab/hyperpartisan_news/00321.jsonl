{"text":"All empires have experienced blowback , but modern transportation , communications , and weaponry -- including possibly nuclear , biological , chemical or radiological devices -- could make it catastrophic , as demonstrated on 9 - 11 .Thus , the militaristic , activist U.S. foreign policy is out - of - date and should be changed .A more restrained foreign policy is crucial because improved intelligence and homeland security can only do so much .The United States is a large , wealthy , free country with porous borders and many lucrative targets to hit -- for example , skyscrapers , ports , schools , sports stadiums , and chemical and nuclear plants .Given the vulnerability of the country to terrorism and the government 's inability to protect everything , reducing the motivation for terrorists to attack the United States is crucial .Using military force only as a last resort in times of genuine peril to the nation would reduce the size of the bull 's eye that the U.S. government has painted on the backs of its people .This policy change was not made by either the Clinton or Bush administrations before the inevitable happened on September 11 .It 's a pretty good bet that the aggressive Bush administration foreign policy has helped cause the post-9 - 11 spike in terrorist activity .Does attributing the primary cause of anti - U.S. terrorism to U.S. foreign policy and advocating military restraint overseas implicitly blame the victim for the attack and indicate that we should appease terrorists ?Neither is the case .Thus , a policy of swift punishment meted out to anti - U.S. terrorist groups , especially al - Qaeda , can not be misconstrued as appeasement .But in the long - term , Americans must realize that although the terrorists are wrong for killing innocents , their own government bears some of the blame for creating the underlying grievances motivating terrorists to attack in the first place .Over the longer horizon , the U.S. government should quietly narrow its conception of vital interests and adopt a policy of military restraint .Also , a more restrained foreign policy , by changing how Arabs think about America , could dramatically lessen whatever popular support terrorists have in Islamic countries .Although these significant departures from existing U.S. policy may be difficult to achieve soon , Americans should realize that adopting them would dramatically reduce terrorists ' motives to attack the United States .If Americans want to continue such policies anyway , they should at least be aware of the high cost .Far from appeasement , these policy changes would benefit the United States whether or not anti - U.S. terrorists launch attacks .Costs in U.S. lives and money would be reduced dramatically , the U.S. military would not be in its currently overstretched condition , and imperial overextension would be eliminated -- all reducing the likelihood of American decline as a great power .Furthermore , resisting the urge to strike groups and countries that are n't attacking the United States is more in keeping with the values of a republic ( rather than those of an empire ) .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"74.59711"}

Bush .A large car bomb and weapons were confiscated .Saddam Hussein had vowed to assassinate Bush for his prosecution of the war .In early 1993 , Islamic extremists attempted to kill 250,000 people by toppling the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City .Ramzi Yousef , the leader of the group , claimed that the intent was to cause casualties on the order of the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima in order to punish the United States for its support and aid for Israel .But the car bomb , placed in the parking garage under one of the towers , did not topple them .( The perpetrators had considered augmenting the bomb with chemical or radiological agents that would have increased the casualties . )Later in 1993 , as a follow - up to the World Trade Center attack , the same group planned to assassinate Senator Al D'Amato of New York and destroy several New York landmarks in one day , but they were caught before they could carry out the plot .Yousef himself was arrested before he could carry out yet another plot to simultaneously bomb 12 jumbo jets and kill 4,000 passengers .In 1996 , Hezbollah of Saudi Arabia ( which differs from Hezbollah of Lebanon ) attacked the U.S. military apartment complex at Khobar Towers near Dhahran , Saudi Arabia .The attack killed 19 U.S. airmen and wounded 515 people .The perpetrators , rather than despising America per se , had a very specific , realpolitik goal : They wanted to compel the withdrawal of the U.S. military from Saudi Arabia .Also , in October 2003 , a U.S. diplomatic convoy was attacked in Gaza .Three U.S. security guards were killed .A day earlier , Israel had arrested suspects from a rogue Palestinian militant group .A senior U.S. official believed the attack on the convoy was motivated by growing anti - American resentment in Palestinian areas caused , in part , by U.S. policy in the region .My report also described several al - Qaeda - related attacks .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"83.725815"}

{"text":"Yet the argument is wrong .Had people bothered to scratch below the surface , they would have seen warning signs that Bush 's aphorism was false and even dangerous .To start with , public opinion polls in Islamic nations repeatedly show that people in those countries actually admire America 's political and economic freedom .They also admire American wealth , technology , and even culture .So some other factor must be generating anti - U.S. hatred in these parts of the world .Furthermore , Bush 's grand plan to reduce terrorism by spreading freedom and democracy to Islamic nations -- thereby eliminating the hatred of such values -- is not based on any empirical evidence that oppression causes terrorism .Spreading democracy does n't reduce terrorism and , if anything , actually may make it worse .These data corroborate an earlier well - known study by William Eubank and Leonard Weinberg , professors at the University of Nevada , Reno , which found that most terrorist attacks happen in democracies -- with both the victims and the attackers usually being citizens of democracies .Gause also notes that recent elections and public opinion polls in Arab countries indicate that the advent of democracy would probably generate Islamic governments that would be much less likely to cooperate with the United States than their authoritarian predecessors .Those Islamic governments might also be more likely to sponsor terrorism .Iraq provides a current example of democratization leading to more terrorism .During the authoritarian reign of Saddam Hussein , Iraq provided some limited assistance to selected Palestinian groups attacking Israel , but did not fund groups that focused their attacks on the United States .Terrorism now runs rampant in a more democratic Iraq , which , according to the U.S. intelligence community , threatens to become an even more significant training ground for worldwide Islamist jihad than Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation .Finally , and most importantly , the evidence is startlingly clear that Bush 's war on terror has actually made things worse .According to the State Department 's data , the number of major terrorist incidents worldwide increased from 121 in 2001 to 175 in 2003 , a 21-year high .Then , in 2004 , the number skyrocketed to 655 significant attacks .Richard Clarke , the chief counterterrorism advisor to both Presidents Bill Clinton and Bush , has noted that terrorism in the three years after 9 - 11 exceeded that during the three years preceding it .If evidence indicates that Bush 's broadly constructed war on terror is counterproductive , what can be done to get better results ?To respond adequately to terrorism , the U.S. government and American people need to know why the terrorists are motivated to give up their time , money , and sometimes even their lives to attack the targets of a faraway land .To deny or delude ourselves about the true causes of such terrorism is dangerous .And the facts about terrorism lead us to the conclusion , controversial and difficult to accept as it may be , that the terrorists do n't hate the United States for \" what it is .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"86.315445"}

Cole , President Clinton implicitly acknowledged that U.S. foreign policy was the cause of the attack : \" If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East , they will fail utterly .\" The attacks on the Spanish trains and British subway system were also related to U.S. foreign policy .Al - Qaeda wanted to drive a wedge between the United States and the only other countries in the world that provided significant forces to invade and occupy Iraq .The group was hoping to attack the home territories of those two nations to compel them to withdraw their troops from Iraq .Mohammed is believed to have been involved in the beheading .The group proclaimed , \" We asure [ sic ] Americans that they shall never be safe on Muslim land of Pakistan .\" This statement indicates that one of its major goals is not about freedom at all , but is quite specific -- to remove the \" infidel \" presence from Muslim lands .Zarqawi has the same motivation when he attacks U.S. and allied forces ( for example , the Italians in Nasiriyah ) in Iraq .Although Zarqawi supplies only a small percentage of Iraq 's rebels , his forces account for a disproportionate share of the carnage because of their numerous and effective suicide attacks .In November 2005 , Iraqis linked to Zarqawi launched suicide bombings against three American chain hotels in Amman , Jordan , in retaliation for U.S. military attacks on Fallujah , Iraq .U.S. leaders would prefer to muddle bin Laden 's motives for attacking the United States .Yet if they want to know why bin Laden has dedicated his life to killing Americans and their allies , they do n't even need to ask him .He has written many manifestos and has done interviews with Western media .From these writings and interviews , one can conclude only that bin Laden 's major grievance is with U.S. foreign policy .According to Peter Bergen , one of the few Western journalists to interview him , bin Laden rarely condemns permissive U.S. culture .Also , he rarely speaks of the evils of democracy as such .Instead , he is especially incensed by U.S. support for corrupt regimes in the Islamic world and the U.S. military presence in the Islamic lands of the Persian Gulf , a presence he would like to dislodge .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"95.97463"}

Bush 's cancellation of his trip to Switzerland after human - rights groups threatened to bring legal action against him for authorizing torture .Persons detained by the U.S. government after 9/11 were subjected to what the Bush administration euphemistically called \" enhanced interrogation , \" including waterboarding .In reality those methods constituted torture , violating U.S. law and international agreements .Under those agreements charges can be filed against members of the Bush administration in jurisdictions outside the United States .The Center for Constitutional Rights along with European groups said they will ask Swiss authorities to initiate a criminal case against Bush .They also planned to file their own complaint .If all that Bush and members of his administration suffer for their crimes are travel restrictions , it will be a mild penalty indeed .( Alas , the U.S. government can and probably will obtain immunity for him . )They deserve far more , starting with a public criminal investigation in the United States , followed by trials .But President Obama says there will be no investigation of top officials .Wishing to \" look ahead , \" he has decided to treat Bush & Co. as above the law , embracing Richard Nixon 's maxim , When the president does it , it 's not illegal .In Germany that used to be known as the Führer Principle .Many of us naively thought it was repudiated at the Nuremberg trials after World War II .How wrong we were .The stain that Bush and Obama have left on America wo n't fade anytime soon .It would have been bad enough to torture people actually suspected of wrongdoing , but the Bush administration went well beyond that .Many people subjected to hideous treatment were picked up on the flimsiest of \" evidence .\" People were offered bounties to turn others in ; naturally , some saw that as a chance to settle old scores having nothing to do with terrorism .Absence of evidence ( as former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld might say ) was not considered evidence of absence .In at least one case , a man was tortured - by the U.S. government 's helper in Egypt , Omar Suleiman - to get the prisoner to say that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had trained al - Qaeda agents .Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney badly wanted to justify their preexisting wish to effect regime change in Iraq by tying Saddam to 9/11 .But there was never any evidence of Iraqi complicity .That reminds us that torture was not the only crime committed by the Bush administration .The Iraq and Afghanistan wars were also ( and still are ) outrages because , among other reasons , they were based on lies .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"112.089165"}

{"text":"This is one of the reasons that only the Republicans and Democrats are the only political parties on the ballot in all 50 states .Before any campaign literature is printed or candidates presented to voters , hundreds of thousands of dollars must be raised .The requirements for ballot access only get more difficult year by year .This is because the two national political parties have a vested interest in making the process difficult .It 's easy to understand how this benefits them .We may believe that casting a ballot in the United States is free with the price of citizenship until we realize that putting choices on that ballot is prohibitively expensive .Trying to form a new political party led me into the shadowy world of campaign finance .When I started to examine the practice of raising cash for political campaigns , I soon realized that much of the money raised for federal office seekers came from special interest groups like Pac 's , lobbyists and bundled contributions from corporations .I became adept at \" following the money \" by accessing The Center for Responsive Politics .I soon realized that starting a new political party was daunting , to say the least .The Liberal Party of America had by this time , members in eight States and a very comprehensive website .Still , by this time , I understood that any real prospects of successfully starting a new political party were more than likely a million to one .After this experience , I realized that campaign finance reform was truly the reform that enables all other reforms .The two major political parties have no interest in changing the status quo , and why should they ?The truth is that they have made the process of ballot access more difficult through the years .The monopoly they have managed to maintain and build upon in the twentieth century has been remarkable .The truly amazing thing about their co - opting of the political process in America is that they have managed to keep it from becoming an issue that begs reform .It is very rare to see a politician push for campaign finance reform .I believe that the reason for this is twofold .The second reason is that campaign reform is a true Catch-22 ; only elected officials can change the system and most elected officials owe their political fortune to this rigged system .It would be political suicide to stand against what has allowed these two parties to play what is the only game in town .The McCain - Feingold Bill was the last meaningful campaign finance reform bill .It took courage for these two senators to propose it across party lines .I believe it was readily accepted because it was basically outdated before it became law .It was too little , too late .With the recent Supreme Court decision to allow corporations , unions and special interest groups to donate to political campaigns with no limits , we have basically ceded our Federal government to those with the money to buy it .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"114.01116"}
