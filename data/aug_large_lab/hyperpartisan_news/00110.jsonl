{"text":"( As it happens , situs inversus does exist , but it occurs in only 0.01 percent of the population , far too little to be the cause of left - handedness . )This belief persisted until the early part of the 19th century , when the assumptions of popular psychology seeped into scientific explanations of left - handedness .More recently , psychologists and neurologists have tried to find a biological basis for left - handedness .One theory , proposed by Marian Annett in the 1970s , held that handedness could be explained by a notion of dominant and recessive traits , much in the way that brown and blue eyes are .Right - handedness , like brown eyes , would be a dominant trait .The twist : Left - handedness was not the recessive trait .Rather , the recessive trait was a genetic indifference to hand preference .If you receive one copy of the dominant allele from your parents , you 'll turn out to be right - handed , but if you receive two copies of the recessive allele , then it becomes a toss up between left - handedness and right - handedness .Another popular theory , put forward by the behavioral neurologist Norman Geschwind around the same time that Annett was doing her work , pointed to hormones .Geschwind claimed that people who were exposed to high concentrations of testosterone as fetuses were more likely to be left - handed .Excessive testosterone exposure correlated well with slightly higher incidences of dyslexia and epilepsy , and so , Geschwind noticed , did left - handedness .The trouble with both these theories , says Smits , is that they fail to account adequately for the surprising connections between left - handedness and twins .Not only is left - handedness twice as common among twins as among regular siblings , but left - handers are twice as likely as right - handers to produce twins .This eerie link lies at the heart of another modern theory ( and Smits 's favorite ) : that \" being a monozygotic twin is a precondition of being left - handed . \"In other words , only someone who has had a twin in utero can be truly left - handed .The twins are mirror images of one another ; one is left - handed , and the other right - handed .Of course , left - handedness does n't require that one ultimately be born with a twin .If only one fetus results at the end of term , that means the other died in the womb and was absorbed by the mother : a \" vanishing twin .\" There are two major problems with this theory , as Smits notes .One is that many twins vanish so early in a pregnancy that they are never detected .Without knowing how frequently they occur , nobody can be sure whether twins account for the 10 percent occurrence of left - handedness in the population .Another problem - one that dogs all studies about left - handedness - is that handedness is not truly a binary phenomenon : Many people use their left hands for some tasks and their right hands for others .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"60.88472"}

{"text":"It 's Good for You .It may be an age - old saying that makes most people groan whenever a friend or family member feels the need to say it , but there are actual psychological benefits that come from simply putting on a smile .Researchers have been examining this phenomenon for a few decades now and even though it is not a new age , 21st century discovery , it is nonetheless amazing and unexpected .One would intuitively assume that facial expressions are an external representation of what is going on inside the brain .Classically , facial expressions are considered to be influenced by mood and thought .It seems to be a one - way street in which the brain controls the face , but this is not the case .Charles Darwin hypothesized that emotional facial expressions are an innate and universal human characteristic .A happy face is a happy face no matter where you are in the world .This theory has been thoroughly explored and psychologists have produced evidence that supports this century - old speculation .This is convenient in a way , because if facial expressions were specific to a geographic region , people would have to learn faces as if they were learning a new language .What a challenge that would be !But the more interesting aspect to these universal facial expressions is that the physical expression can directly influence one 's emotions .Studies on this finding were approached in multiple ways .One study conducted at Clark University in Worcester , MA instructed patients to move certain parts of their face in various ways , such as raising the eyebrows or relaxing the mouth , and then reporting their emotions .( The patients were not told that the study had anything to do with emotion . )In another study performed by a group of German researchers , patients were told to clench a pen in their front teeth , creating a smile , or hold the pen in their protruding lips , creating a pout , and then report their emotional state .In these studies , patient 's emotions were consistent with the resulting facial expression .So , it can be inferred from these findings that making a happy face can help make you happy .It must be noted that changing facial expression is not a means of changing one 's whole state of mind .Certainly someone who is mourning can not just put on a smile and instantly be cured of all sadness .It is not that simple .It is more realistic to think that facial expression can influence emotion , not directly change it .We would all be in for quite a roller coaster ride of emotion if the opposite were true , and a rapid change of facial expression was able to instantaneously change our moods .If this finding is valid then there must be some physical explanation or neural substrate to explain it .Even though researchers observed this phenomenon decades ago , a full explanation is yet to be obtained .There are a number of hypotheses , though .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"78.508865"}

{"text":"But it reminds me of that Dr. Seuss book One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish .I confess the charm of Dr. Seuss wore off for me a great deal faster than it did for my kids ...Even after reading his books aloud over and over and over and over again to my kids they still loved them .Once they began to read , I had to listen to them read them aloud over and over and over and over again .Of course , my antipathy toward Dr. Seuss was nothing compared to my feelings about a giant purple dinosaur whose name will not be spoken here .Suffice to say , his affections were most assuredly not returned by me .I could n't even listen to the YouTube video of that song without shuddering and I shut it off after the first line .But I digress .In this study ( freely accessible online thanks to PLoSONE ) researchers look at how having either a Democrat or Republican political affiliation may change how your brain functions during risky decision - making .It is also important to note that these researchers use the descriptors Democrat / Liberal and Republican / Conservative interchangeably .They believe that this idea is valid and point to a 1998 article to explain : . \" While party registration is not a perfect proxy for ideology , a realignment that started in the 1970s has caused the two to become increasingly correlated over the past 40 years .Political polarization at both the mass and elite levels have created a period where ideology and partisanship are substantially overlapping concepts .This trend has been even stronger in California ( where the participants in this study resided ) than in other states . \"\" However , our evidence indicates that since the 1970s , ideological polarization has increased dramatically among the mass public in the United States as well as among political elites .There are now large differences in outlook between Democrats and Republicans , between red state voters and blue state voters , and between religious voters and secular voters .These divisions are not confined to a small minority of activists - they involve a large segment of the public and the deepest divisions are found among the most interested , informed , and active citizens .Moreover , contrary to Fiorina 's suggestion that polarization turns off voters and depresses turnout , our evidence indicates that polarization energizes the electorate and stimulates political participation .\" The current researchers cite prior research on what the brains of liberals and conservatives look like structurally .Using a \" simple gambling game \" , prior research found that \" liberals and conservatives have significantly different brain structure , with liberals showing increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex , and conservatives showing increased gray matter volume in the in the amygdala \" .For the current research , the researchers looked at what areas of the brain were used during those gambling tasks and found a difference in what parts of the brain were activated during those decisions .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"106.36883"}
