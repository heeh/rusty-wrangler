{"text":"Thanks to everyone for letting me vent .I hope to hear something soon ! ! !A lot of the arguments here on both sides seem to be unaware of some important facts : .Many so - called \" sexual assaults \" committed by children and teenagers are actually indecency , mutually desired sex play , or romantic / sexual relationships that violate decency or age of consent laws .Talking about treatment , recidivism , and dangerousness in such cases is rather ridiculous .One prosecutor in Texas said half of all \" child sexual abuse \" cases coming across his desk were consensual teen sex .Even when younger children are sexually aggressive , it 's often due to not being socialized yet .Children often hit , bite , punch , and steal from other children .It should n't be surprising that they might be sexually aggressive too , since they have n't yet learned that we see sexual behavior as far worse than other kinds of behavior .No one advocates prosecuting physically violent children as adults , imprisoning them for life , putting them on registries , monitoring their every move , or keeping them away from other children .Only a minority of physically aggressive children and teenagers are seriously violent and dangerous , and in need of serious legal consequences .In the same way , only a small minority of \" juvenile sex offenders \" are actually violent and in need of serious consequences .The hysteria over \" juvenile sex offenders \" has led to abusive treatment by both the legal system and so - called sex offender \" treatment \" providers .Treatment often directly contradicts everything that is known about promoting healthy emotional developemnt .Much \" treatment \" is really barbaric punishment , which violates the most basic ethical and therapeutic principles .Cracking down on \" juvenile sex offenders \" is not about protecting children .It 's about fear and hysteria over imaginary monsters created by the media and politicians who are making money and building their careers by destroying the lives of children they see as worthless .Those people who call children \" predators \" have stopped using their minds and bought into the hysteria and hatred for these children .Let me start by giving a brief history of Uncle Tom ...Uncle Tom has always held the connotation of a black person who \" sold - out \" his race of people to garner favor with white people .Generations upon generations of blacks have use the term \" Uncle Tom \" in a derogatory fashion to cast aspersions on our fellow black men .The true fact about Uncle Tom is that he was name after Josiah Henson , a former slave who freed himself and , afterwards , went back to free over 120 fellow slaves .True accounts of Josiah Henson portraits him has a man of character , strength and valor .Sadly historic truths palls in the face of folklore inspired by the minstrels of the 1800 's which painted the brave hero has a \" black sell - out \" .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"50.549217"}

{"text":"House Passes Bill to Strengthen Sex Offender Laws .By Morgan Hightower .Members of the Alabama House of Representatives Tuesday voted to strengthen the state 's sex offender laws , passing a bill sponsored by Rep. Blaine Galliher ( R - Rainbow City ) that would close loopholes in current law and require more frequent and thorough registration of sex offenders in Alabama .Sex offenders would also have to register four times a year instead of the current requirement of two registrations per year .Representative Galliher said updating Alabama 's sex offender laws will create better awareness of what sex offenders reside in the community , enabling the public to better protect themselves . \"Registration and notification laws protect the community and serve to deter sex offenders from future crimes , \" Representative Galliher said .\"Requiring more frequent and thorough registration will maintain better contact between sex offenders and law enforcement , providing police and sheriff 's offices with the tools they need to identify , monitor and track sex offenders .We 're looking out for victims , and giving our communities the resources they need in the law to keep families safe .\" The bill also closes a loophole that makes it difficult to enforce registration and notification requirements for homeless sex offenders by mandating that , until they obtain a permanent residence , homeless sex offenders must register with local law enforcement once a week .Another provision in the bill makes it a felony for a sex offender to contact or harass his or her victim .House Bill 378 also brings Alabama up to date with federal sex offender law by ensuring that a comprehensive list of sex offenses is applicable to registration and notification requirements .A similar bill has passed the Senate .Representative Galliher said he would work with the Senate Sponsor , Senator Cam Ward to combine the bills and ensure the strongest possible law ultimately passes .Rep. Steve Hurst , D - Munford , has pushed legislation authorizing castration for four long years now .However , given the political climate in Alabama , it is always worth noting .Personally politicians like him should be surgically lobotomized .Hurst , a Republican from Talladega , has proposed a bill that would require convicted child molesters to be surgically castrated under certain conditions .Specifically , the bill states that anyone more than 21 years old convicted of certain sex offenses against a child 12 years old or younger must be surgically castrated before being released from the state Department of Corrections .\" We need something to protect the children out here , \" Hurst said .\" They ca n't protect themselves . \"Olivia Turner , executive director of the Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union , said in a Tuesday email to The Star that while Hurst 's intentions are good , he is going too far with his bill .Turner said the castration bill is based on a false premise that sexual assault is the product of an uncontrollable sex drive .\" The reality is that sexual crimes are about violence , power and the humiliation of a survivor or victim , which is why a castrated sex offender can still be a serious danger , \" Turner wrote . \" The highest priority for members of the Legislature working to reduce repeat offenses by sex offenders should be an examination of the effectiveness and availability of psychological treatment for sex offenders in the custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections . \"","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"62.54636"}
