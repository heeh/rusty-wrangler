{"text":"And I believe the NFL is the most popular league in the world for a reason .And that 's that every fan knows at the beginning of the season that their team has a chance to go to the Super Bowl .And I believe that belief is an important quality for any league to be successful .Therefore I certainly subscribe more to the NFL 's approach to parity than I do perhaps to the structure of the English Premier League , where for the most part only a handful of clubs really have a chance of winning the league each year .Q : What separates your players from athletes from other major sports leagues in America ?A : Soccer players are truly unique in that they grow up in a very diverse environment as youth players .They tend to turn professional at a very young age .From their earliest playing days they travel abroad for international competition .Therefore they seem to be more worldly than other professional athletes .What 's more I take great pride in the fact that our league is made up of guys like Brian Ching , who are deeply committed in their community , have their own foundations and truly embrace their position as role models .If there is anything that I am the most proud of as commissioner it 's the quality of the character of our players , and I really mean that .Q : For many in America , soccer is considered a European or Latin American sport .How can MLS help the sport evolve past that type of reputation ?A : America is truly made up of every country from around the world .It infuriates me when I hear comments that soccer is not an American sport .It is so totally American in that we are such a global nation .I truly believe that this sport resonates with a very , very changing demographic .A very , very changing American demographic that 's multilingual , that 's connected to the global community and that represents different ethnic groups .Q : What is your position on goal - line technology ?A : We are very supportive of any changes that FIFA decides to make that would utilize technology that would improve officiating .We would never make that decision on our own .But without doubt we would be supportive of both utilizing technology or even additional officials to just make our games better .Q : Is there a subject that you 'd like to touch more on before we finish ?A : Yes , Landon Donovan .Landon in my view is one of the best American soccer players of our generation .He 's just such an important part of our league 's history and he 's also an important part of our future .Phoenix ' Los Suns ' protest drives sweep over Spurs .Maybe what the Phoenix Suns basketball team needed during their historic sweep over the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference semifinals was a little courage and teamwork to stand up for what 's right .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"59.26142"}

{"text":"These two dangerous and racist groups claim that their message of hate is somehow linked to patriotism .It is n't .Ever since they took the Union flag and flag of Saint George as emblems for their own odious agendas , a fear of guilt by association has arisen .This is a huge pity , both for those living in England and English society as a whole as it detracts from the sort of unity that that this country used to enjoy , and which other countries still enjoy today .The racism of thugs has nothing to do with patriotism .Real patriotism is a shared sense of national personality .It is pride in the heritage and cultural history of your country .It 's an appreciation of your nation 's environment and sights , both its natural beauty and its inspiring man - made structures .Patriotism is being part of not just the community around you , but of institutions and achievements which might be hundreds of years old .It 's the celebration of who you are and where you call home .It 's an appreciation of your own identity and yet also a feeling of kinship .It is in fact one of the best , most selfless and noblest things a person can feel .We should stop assuming that someone flying a Saint George 's flag outside of a sports match must be a racist .Oscar Wilde is attributed as having said that \" patriotism is a virtue of the vicious \" .If he actually said that , then he was wrong .And so too are all the people who jump to the assumption that someone flying a Saint George 's flag outside of a sports match must be racist .Not only is proper English patriotism something that people ought to show proudly , it would also greatly deflate any arguments that racist groups may have .So long as flying the flag is seen as taboo by the chattering classes and automatically dismissed as the act of a racist or a lunatic , those who want to show their patriotism will always feel alienated .But I would go further than that .I do n't just think that we should be more tolerant of patriotism ; I think that on the whole the English ought to embrace it .So my suggestion for this summer is to really get involved .The Queen 's Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics both promise to be staggeringly good events , and as ever there 's a myriad of other events throughout the year for people to not just feel proud of their nation , but to show off the fact too .I say , go out there , fly the flags and make the absolute most of a wonderful time .Interesting article , but I feel patriotism and the lack of it in England is a non - issue .Patriotism simply means a devotion to one 's country , and is entirely different to having a sense of pride in common heritage and cultural history .A great first article !","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"106.15021"}
