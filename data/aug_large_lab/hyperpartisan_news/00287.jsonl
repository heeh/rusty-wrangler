{"text":"There on cable television again were pictures of Bill Clinton hugging Monica Lewinsky .And the image of Spitzer 's wife standing painfully by his side while he acknowledged unspecified wrongdoing could not help but remind some viewers , and voters , of Hillary Clinton 's own stand - by - her - man moment .How this will all play out remains unclear , of course .It may be that most voters long ago discounted Bill Clinton 's infidelities when making their minds up about his wife 's qualifications for president .It may be that voters conclude that Spitzer 's indiscretions have nothing at all to do with whether Hillary Clinton can effectively serve as president .And it may be that Spitzer ultimately does resign , allowing the political dialogue to move on .Yet this certainly is not the way Clinton 's strategists would have mapped out this week on the campaign trail .They want voters to be thinking about that 3 a.m. phone call in terms of who is ready to handle a crisis in the White House , not in terms of where an unfaithful husband might be catting around town .And , sure enough , the late - night comedians wasted little time linking the Spitzer case to the Clintons .Jay Leno joked last night that Spitzer 's scandal \" means Hillary Clinton is now only the second angriest woman in the state of New York . \"David Letterman offered a Top 10 List of excuses Spitzer might cite , including the number one excuse : \" I thought Bill Clinton legalized this years ago . \" Hillary Clinton was asked about the case late yesterday and , predictably enough , tried to brush it off without comment .\" I obviously send my best wishes to the governor and his family , \" she told reporters .Still , it is hard to imagine that will be the last time she is asked about it .She could hardly want to be there on camera , once again being asked to account for yet another man in her life who ca n't live up to his marriage vows .And what will Bill Clinton say if and when he is asked to comment ?Spitzer has been a bad - luck charm for Hillary Clinton to this point .His illegal immigrant driver 's license proposal arguably became the first time she was thrown off her stride in this campaign .Fairly or not , her muddled answer at a debate in Philadelphia about whether she supported it or not played into a narrative promoted by her opponents that she is more about calculation than principle .That led to a bad patch for her that lasted all the way through the Iowa caucuses .Her advisers pinpoint that inartful two - minute answer as the moment when the race turned .Now Spitzer may throw her off stride again at a moment she needs to keep her momentum going .And on top of that , even if he does spare her by resigning soon , that has a cost too -- one fewer superdelegate for her at the convention .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"47.09096"}

{"text":"When there is a lack of information or situational ambiguity , participants base their judgments mainly on beliefs or myths about sexual assaults .One might also ask : why are there differences between men and women in the influence of these myths ?This is perhaps because men usually perceive greater ambiguity than women do in circumstances in which this type of sexual interaction occurs ( Temkin & Krahé , 2008 ) .On a similar note , it is interesting to observe how participants ' evaluations of the non - coercive behaviors included in the scenario ( options c and d ) did not turn out to be affected by RMA level , or by the sex variable .In other words , myths , as interpretive schemas , only permeate our judgment about behaviors that are in some way related to rape stereotypes , but not about behaviors that respect women 's sexual freedom .Another variable of interest to the present study was the evaluation of alcohol consumption by women in the context of sexual relations ( Hypothesis 4 ) .Our prediction suggested that men ( relative to women ) , and participants with high scores on the RMA ( relative to those with low scores ) evaluate this behavior more negatively , and more often associate it with women being promiscuous .The results support our hypothesis .These differences also occurred as a function of RMA level ; participants with high acceptance of rape myths agreed more with both statements .According to Maurer and Robinson ( 2008 ) , it seems that for women , alcohol consumption is associated with their sexual intentions , so drinking increases their \" responsibility \" over what might happen to them , but that is not so for men .When men consume alcohol , it exempts them from responsibility for their actions , which are attributed to loss of self - control .Nevertheless , women reported greater agreement with these two response options than men did , possibly due to the fact that women tend to perceive fewer sexual intentions than men in this type of situation ( Maurer & Robinson , 2008 ) .Our research , however , has certain limitations that should be taken into consideration .One such limitation is the participants ' level of honesty .It is possible that when dealing with such a delicate matter as , for example , to admit being the active agent of a sexual assault , male participants may have tried to hide or falsify their responses as a way of improving their image .Similarly , we can not guarantee that women 's responses were completely honest , and that no social desirability effect occurred .It is also necessary to highlight that the study employed artificial scenarios created specifically for this study , which could detract from the credibility of the information presented .We also wish to draw your attention to the small size of some of the effects , which is apparent in the reported values of η^sup 2^.

{"text":"In general , alcohol consumption is more common among whites than blacks ( Caetano et al ., 1998 ) .Thus , not surprisingly , alcohol - related sexual assaults appear to be more common among white college students than among black college students ( Abbey et al . , 1996a ; Harrington and Leitenberg , 1994 ) .Rates of alcohol - related sexual assault have not been examined in other ethnic groups .Overall , the characteristics of alcohol - involved sexual assaults and sexual assaults that do not involve alcohol are similar .Approximately 90 % of the sexual assaults reported by college women are perpetrated by someone the victim knew ; about half occur on a date ( Abbey et al . , 1996a ; Koss , 1988 ) .Only about 5 % involve gang rapes .The most common locations are the woman 's or man 's home ( this includes dormitory rooms , apartments , fraternities , sororities and parents ' homes ) in the context of a date or party .Alcohol - involved sexual assaults more often occur among college students who know each other only casually and who spent time together at a party or bar ( Abbey et al . , 1996a ; Ullman et al . , 1999 ) .Explanations for the Relationship between Alcohol Consumption and Sexual Assault .The fact that alcohol consumption and sexual assault frequently co - occur does not demonstrate that alcohol causes sexual assault .The causal direction could be the opposite ; men may consciously or unconsciously drink alcohol prior to committing sexual assault to have an excuse for their behavior .Alternatively , other variables may simultaneously cause both alcohol consumption and sexual assault .For example , personality traits , such as impulsivity , or peer group norms may lead some men both to drink heavily and to commit sexual assault .It is likely that each of these causal pathways explains some alcohol - involved sexual assaults .A complex behavior such as sexual assault has multiple determinants both across different perpetrators and for any one perpetrator .Abbey ( 1991 ) proposed seven different explanations for the relationship between alcohol and sexual assault .An expanded version of this model is described below and is summarized in Figure 1 ( for a more thorough review , see Abbey et al . , 1996b ) .This model focuses on the most common type of sexual assault that occurs between men and women who know each other and are engaged in social interaction prior to the assault , the prototypic college sexual assault situation .As can be seen in the figure , a combination of preexisting beliefs and situational factors contribute to acquaintance sexual assault .Alcohol has independent and synergistic effects .Some general information about causes of acquaintance rape are described below because alcohol often exacerbates dynamics that can arise without alcohol .Two general caveats are needed before the literature supporting each element of the model is reviewed .First , there are personality characteristics ( e.g. , impulsivity , low empathy ) and past experiences ( e.g. , childhood sexual abuse , delinquency ) that have been consistently linked to sexual assault perpetration .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"108.97752"}
{"text":"I need to commit to the difficult work of challenging rape culture and the broader sexist culture in which it swims .What will you do ?Comment ( 1 ) .Tim B April 17 , 2013 at 1:30 pm .I think we need to ask ourselves \" What in our culture enables men to believe that rape is acceptable behavior ?\" It is not a religious issue , or a institutional one .It is not a problem based on policy in the United States .For instance , in the Stuebenville case , policies existed to expose the problem and seek justice ( whether those policies were followed is another matter . )Culturally speaking , sexual violence is something that we are opposed to and very vocal about .We have a TV show dedicated to it ( Law and Order : SVU ) .College campuses speak about it .As a culture , compared to others in the world , sexual violence is spoken about and it is never justified here .However , with the amount of sexual violence that continues it is clear that our message and policies have failings .And that is a cultural issue , some deep seeded value within our society that those who commit sexual crimes justify it at the time ( though they may regret it later ) .So where does that value come from ?We can point to women 's magazines or pornography , or to the way women dress or behave .We can point to alcohol or hook up culture .When someone says \" Well , women should n't dress provocatively if they do n't want to be raped .\" I think we misconstrue that statement as blaming the victim .In reality , that person is trying to point to cultural values they do n't have a firm grasp on .They 're saying : \" Women should protect themselves .Not send overly flirtatious messages .Not go alone with men they barely know .\" When I leave my car , I lock it .I store my laptop in my trunk out of sight .Good advice is n't always blaming the victim , sometimes it 's just good advice .If we examine our culture and the values that hold it up , what do we see ?What are the values that our society holds most dear ?You find those , seek those , and you 'll have your answers .You might think the answer is obvious - women who have active sex lives ( with \" many casual sexual partners \" - if you go by the Oxford Dictionary definition ) - but you would be wrong .According to researchers Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton of the University of Michigan , the label is actually gaining currency as a catch - all insult that divides women on the basis of class .Wealthier women have affairs or one - night stands , whereas poorer ones are perceived as the ' real sluts ' .The pair 's earlier work with the same student group on the subject of one - night stands was heavily referenced in Hanna Rosin 's book The End of Men .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"112.07706"}
