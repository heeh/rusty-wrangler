{"text":"However , as Gingrich said , \" we stand for freedom , \" so we let him off with just 5 .The State Department did not cite any evidence of Iqbal 's programming services causing any violence , leaving the \" incitement of violence \" claim quite dubious .In fact , \" Incitement of violence \" does not seem to concern the State Department .Here is a headline from the New York Times last year : .The man accused of the killing spree in Norway was deeply influenced by a small group of American bloggers and writers who have warned for years about the threat from Islam , lacing his 1,500-page manifesto with quotations from them .Anders Breivik , the anti - Muslim extremist who killed 77 last year , named numerous Islamophobes as inspirations for his acts , such as America 's own Robert Spencer of the Jihad Watch website , whom he cited 64 times .According to Foreign Policy , Breivik drew his \" intellectual inspiration \" from \" the work of British - Swiss ' historian ' Bat Ye'or , \" who has warned of the coming \" Eurabia .\" While xenophobes like them should be allowed to speak their mind freely , if western governments were really concerned about \" incitement of violence \" they would not hesitate to crack down on people like this rather than Mr. Iqbal .While Robert Spencer is given full 1 st Amendment Rights , others are not as worthy .In the Supreme Court 's 2010 ruling in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project the HLP , a human rights group , sought to teach the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) how to resolve disputes peacefully using international law .Unfortunately , this was illegal under a provision of the PATRIOT Act because the PKK is listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization ( FTO ) , and so any \" expert advice or assistance \" constitutes \" material support .\" The Court upheld the law 6 - 3 , over objections from several human rights groups and civil liberties advocates , such as the American Civil Liberties Union , which said of it : \" Today 's decision is disappointing and inconsistent with our First Amendment position .The government should not be in the business of criminalizing speech meant to promote peace and human rights .\"As the name of the case implies , Eric Holder , Obama 's Attorney General , brought the case to the Court .In addition , it was argued by Solicitor General Elena Kagan , who became the newest Obama appointee on the Supreme Court just months later .Further casting doubt on Obama 's support for free speech , it appears that his administration sought a more extreme decision than the one which was ultimately handed down .Chief Justice John Roberts , writing for the majority , opined that the government 's position did not sufficiently acknowledge the First Amendment , even if the provision was acceptable given the government 's interest in fighting terrorism .Thus , while the Court thought the First Amendment was compatible with the law , the Administration did n't think it worthy of consideration .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"82.86656"}

{"text":"I purchased a webhosting package week of AUGUST 24 , 2009 AND THE NIGHTMARE BEGAN .I attempted the Wizard webbuilder and had problems .I spoke to tech support who informed me the Wizard webbuilder was not in operation and had not been in operation when I purchased the package .I asked if he could give me an approximate time when it would be up and running .He said they did n't know .I asked if it would be days , weeks , months .He said they did n't know but it would be a long time and I could use Trelix .I was not able to access my website address so I called APlus again .I talked to the Aplus rep who told me my web domain name had not been transferred , I had to call Cedant .When I called Cedant 's number , the rep answered the phone as APlus .I explained I was trying to reach the Cedant division .The rep informed me I had dialed the wrong number , this was APlus .I informed the rep APlus had purchased Cedant , they were one in the same but with different divisions .He said he had been working there for awhile , never heard that and who ever told me that was incorrect .I hung up and called until I found someone who knew Cedant / APlus were the same company , just different divisions .To make a long story short as possible .I was paying both Cedant 's division and the APlus division .I was told Cedant did n't renew my domain name when I paid them .The Cedant division did renew my domain names .Cedant told me the domain name would be transferred to the Aplus division , the website would n't be transferred .I explained AGAIN I did n't want the website transferred since I was taking vacation time at work to redo the website .I was told my account with Cedant would be closed once the domain name was transferred and I would be refunded the monies paid to Cedant .Cedant closed my account and refunded my monies .I tried to build my website only to find out the Cedant division did NOT transfer my domain name .I was told the Cedant division would re - open my account to tranfer the name and it would then be closed , it would only take a day .I began receiving billing statements from the Cedant division while the APlus division continued to deduct monies from the bank account I provided to them .I wrote the billing at Cedant , informed them the account was only to be opened for a day because Cedant forgot to transfer the domain name to the APlus division .I informed them I wanted this fixed and wanted to know why they were billing me , etc .I NEVER received a response from Cedant , so I assumed this was taken care of .During this whole time I was unable to receive e - mails from my website address .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"145.4617"}
