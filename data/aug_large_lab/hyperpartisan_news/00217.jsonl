Hillary ?At least according to Sarah Palin .Upset that Fox News host Bill O'Reilly mocked the prospect of Palin and fellow reality television star Donald Trump running for president as a \" reality show , \" Palin charged that O'Reilly is trying to undermine the conservative movement just as it prepares to take on Hillary Clinton .Perkins recently spoke with Frank Gaffne y , a fellow anti - Muslim conspiracy theorist , about the supposed rise of Sharia law in the U.S. , and unsurprisingly , Gaffney joined in on the frenzy and referred to the city as \" Dearbornistan . \"He said the \" Muslim - only \" city of Dearborn has become a \" ghetto \" that is \" too dangerous \" to enter .2 ) Marriage Equality Turns Kids Into Government Property .A group of Catholic and Protestant leaders signed a statement this week warning that the legalization of same - sex marriage will lead \" to the coercion and persecution of those who refuse to acknowledge the state 's redefinition of marriage , which is beyond the state 's competence .\" By legalizing same - sex marriage , the statement reads , \" a kind of alchemy is performed , not merely on the institution , but on human nature itself , \" since same - sex marriage apparently \" disregards the created order , threatens the common good and distorts the Gospel .\"The statement even claims that marriage equality will turn children \" in important legal respects , the property of the state .\" 1 ) Gay Demonic Energy .American Family Radio host Bryan Fischer thinks that Satan makes people gay , so of course Fischer believes that Satan is also in command of the gay rights movement .\" I do n't think you will ever find a more directly demonic energy than when you deal with the homosexual agenda , \" Fischer said this week .\" They 're vicious .They are mean .You literally are staring into virtually the unvarnished energy of Satan himself when you come up against the forces that are pushing the homosexual agenda forward .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"72.948166"}
{"text":"That 's typical of his ego - soaked personality that is only concerned with what advances his interests .And it is expressed frequently in his Twitter feed .Just today there were a couple of tweets that deserve some special recognition due to their grotesque nature .These tweets are emblematic of Trump 's racism and misogyny .And they both attack Fox 's Megyn Kelly , proving that his claim that she had nothing to do with why he skipped the debate was an outright lie .First there was this tweet that shows Megyn Kelly with Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal .It 's purpose is to create a negative association between Kelly and Fox News with Arab royalty , and a Muslim , as if that by itself were some mortal sin .Alwaleed is minority shareholder of 21st Century Fox , the parent corporation of Fox News .There are , however , a couple of problems with that tweet .First of all , it is a fake .Kelly was photoshopped , badly , into the picture .Another problem with it is that @BradCross4 , who originally posted the picture , is a raging and unabashed racist whose twitter account is full of repulsive bigotry .Apparently that did n't bother Trump as he retweeted it .That is something he does frequently .He recently retweeted another racist meme that made ludicrous assertions about African - American crime statistics .Then there was his retweet of an image by someone called @WhiteGenocideTM .It 's hard to pretend he did n't know what that was about .Finally , Trump 's complaint about Fox News having a business relationship with Alwaleed is hypocritical in the extreme .Trump has many such relationships with Muslims , which he often brags about .As one example Trump , bought the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan in 1988 .After suffering serious financial difficulties he was forced to sell it just seven years later at a loss of nearly 40 % to - yep - Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal .So in addition to being a huuuge hypocrite , this also reveals another example of his poor business skills .[ Update : Alwaleed replied to Trump 's tweet with one of his own saying \" Trump : You base your statements on photoshopped pics?I bailed you out twice;a 3rd time , maybe ? \"Alwaleed noted the Plaza Hotel deal where he paid off Trump 's debt .He also revealed that he bought Trump 's yacht after it had been turned over to creditors ] .The other tweet that Trump promoted today was this one that featured Megyn Kelly from an article in GQ .News Corpse reported on these photos at the time and how inappropriate they were for someone purporting to be a news professional .It not only diminished her as a journalist , but it demonstrated how Fox exploits the women they put on air as sexual objects .The problem with Trump weighing in on this is that it is blatantly hypocritical .The tweet refers to Kelly as a \" bimbo \" and , therefore , unfit to moderate a debate .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"73.533066"}

{"text":"Southgate is undoubtedly sincere in his aversion to the classical fascism of Hitler and Mussolini , and has cited this as a reason for his break from one of the National Front splinter groups .He sees the old fascism as discredited , and an abandonment of the true values of revolutionary nationalism .But his ultimate goal , shared with the European New Right , is to create a new form of fascism , with the same core values of a revitalized community that withstands the decadence of cosmopolitan liberal capitalism .This can not be done as long as his views are linked in the popular mind to the older tradition .THIRD POSITION .One of the two main influences on National - Anarchists is a minor current of fascism called Third Position .The origins of Third Position are in National Bolshevism , which originally referred to Communists who sought a national ( rather than international ) revolution .It soon came to refer to Nazis who sought an alliance with the Soviet Union .The most important of these was \" left - wing Nazi \" Otto Strasser , a former Socialist who advocated land redistribution and nationalization of industry .After criticizing Hitler for allying with banking interests , he was expelled from the party .His brother , Gregor Strasser , held similar views but remained a Nazi until 1934 , when other Nazis killed him in the Night of the Long Knives .A number of postwar fascists continued this train of thought , including Francis Parker Yockey and Jean - François Thiriart .Thiriart 's followers in Italy formed a sect of \" Nazi - Maoists \" based on these principles , and after a gruesome August 1980 bombing in Bologna which killed 85 people , 40 Italian fascists fled to England , including Robert Fiore .Fiore was sheltered by National Front member Michael Walker , editor of the Scorpion .19 This paper subsequently spread Third Position and New Right ideas into Britain 's National Front , and Troy Southgate openly credits it as a major influence .20 Third Position ideas also spread through the National Front via the magazine Rising .21 After a 1986 split , this new influence resulted in a reconfiguration of the party 's politics .Prominent members visited Qadafi 's Libya , praised Iran 's Ayatollah Khomeini and forged links with the Nation of Islam in the United States .Southgate claims to have abandoned Third Position fascism .22 This is a duplicitous claim .He has rejected a centralized state , and therefore its ability to nationalize industry or create an \" ethnostate .\" Nonetheless , National - Anarchists retain the two main philosophical threads of Third Position .The first is the notion of a racist socialism , as a third option between both capitalism and left - wing socialism like Marxism or traditional anarchism .23The second is the stress on a strategic and conceptual alliance of nationalists ( especially in the Third World ) against the United States .Just as the National Front praised the Nation of Islam and Qadafi , the National - Anarchists praise Black and Asian racial separatist groups , and support movements for national self - determination , such as the Tibetan independence movement .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"98.73372"}

{"text":"But within a generation or two , their family sizes were little different from those of the general population .Still , many in the West believe that Muslims are different : Not only do they have larger families than the people around them , but they sometimes have higher fertility rates than their cousins back in the home country .Moroccan women in the Netherlands , for instance , have a fertility rate of 2.9 children , while Moroccan women in Morocco have 2.4 children each .Bangladeshis in Britain have 3.0 children , while those in Bangladesh have 2.4 .So even if fertility rates at home are falling toward Western levels , relatives who have migrated to the West appear to be maintaining larger families .This , to some observers , is proof that there is a conspiracy of deliberate population growth , an invasion by reproductive means .There are two important reasons for these higher numbers .First , the Muslim immigrants who come to Europe ( though not so much to the United States or Canada ) are overwhelmingly from rural areas , where fertility rates are much higher than the national average .Around the world and throughout history , rural families have more children - often many more .These immigrants are n't just changing from one national culture to another , but from a rural to an urban culture , which is an even more shocking adjustment .But it is a shift that universally leads to smaller families .It also produces higher - than - usual levels of culture shock and insecurity - one of the key reasons why integration is slower and more difficult for some of these immigrants than it is for more urban immigrant groups .Second , the highest family - size numbers are probably wrong .Women from Muslim countries tend to give birth to the majority of their children soon after arriving in their new homelands .Because of the way total fertility rate is calculated - by averaging the recorded births across a woman 's fertile lifespan - a cluster of births will produce an exaggerated figure .We now have proof that this is occurring .A large - scale study from Germany shows that a sizable majority of immigrants from Turkey marry and have most of their children almost immediately after arrival .Studies in France show that immigrant women tend to have children during their first two years in France - an effect that , once taken into account , lowers the real French Muslim fertility rate from 2.5 children to 2.2 , barely above the native - born French rate .A similar effect is found in Sweden .This high birth rate in the early years tends to create a sense of panic among observers .It led to the rather startling observation that the most common name for baby boys in Britain is Mohammed .At the same time , members of other ethnic groups ( especially white Anglo - Saxons and black American Christians ) are now more than 50 % more likely than they were a generation before to give their children uncommon names .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"126.24471"}
