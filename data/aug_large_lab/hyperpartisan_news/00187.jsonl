{"text":"This was a huge disappointment for me , as I really want real documentaries with true facts .Stuff like where Jeremy Wade caught a Greenland shark is much better than this .Plus , little is known about Greenland sharks , and discovery should spend more time on documenting stuff like that than making up things to lead people astray .Especially the young audiences .This false documenting needs to stop .@john Not just that , but the ' sonar footage ' ( pfft ) clearly shows the shark swimming away afterwards . ...What , they did n't notice that earlier , before going through that old footage from the rigs ?Urgh , just so many things that make no sense .Like , if that incident really did happen in 1996 , no body thought to check the oil rig surveillance footage before now ?How this supposed horrific set of shark attacks happened earlier in this year , yet not a single media outlet reported on them as if shark attacks are never massively huge sensationalist news ?It gets worse though .Discovery started sowing the seeds of this before Shark Week even started .3 weeks before the premier , they created actual youtube accounts for both \" Paula 84 \" and \" Mel Thurmond \" .Which was subsequently ' found ' by Mel Thurmond who comments about wanting to know more about the footage and he 's been doing shark research in ' that area ' . ...Not that the video , nor it 's description ever makes any reference to what area it was recorded in !Whoops !So , of course , we 're led to believe this entire documentary and its core premise was all put together in less than 2 weeks in order to be the premier event of Shark Week .After all , it 's not like these things take months to make .Or that schedules are prepared months ahead of time .In other words , not only is the show itself a load of rubbish , but Discovery have expanded the content onto social media AS IF IT WAS ALL REAL .The show might have had a small disclaimer , but none of the social media content has any disclaimers at all !There 's no two ways about it .They are definitely targeting the more ... suggestible viewers and providing external content that will further legitimise the show to people who turn to google to look up more information , or see the youtube video in the show and decide to look it up .What 's bad is , last night animal planet showed both megaladon and shark of darkness back to back , guess they did n't think that people would put the two together and realize they are talking about the same mythical shark .Now you might think he 's been blogging since January . since that 's what the archives would suggest .Oh ... it seems on this page the user ca n't edit the dates for when posts where made .And the entries for January , February and March were actually all posted on July 17th .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"110.60984"}
