Palmer , of Princeton University , estimates that 200,000 slaves were brought to Mexico during the Neuva Espana colonial period , with their population ranging from about 10 to 35 thousand at any one time .He continues : . \"African labor was vital to the Spanish colonists .As indigenous peoples were killed or died from European diseases , blacks assumed a disproportionate share of the burden of work , particularly in the early colonial period .Others worked in skilled trade or on cattle ranches .\" The first black Mexican to be declared a national hero , more than 300 years after the fact , was Gaspar Yanga , who in 1570 led a sugar plantation slave revolt in what is now the state of Veracruz .He and 500 other escaped slaves ultimately founded a small town in mountains west of Veracruz .Over the next 30 years they fought off all attempts at incursion into the territory until 1806 when the Spanish were forced to sign a treaty with Yanga making the town named after him one of free people .Two of the most important heroes in the struggle for Mexican Independence , Jose Maria Morelos and Vincent Guerrero , were mulattos of humble origins who rallied large swaths of African , Indigenous and mixed blood Mexicans to keep the cause alive at some of its lowest moments .Guerrero went on to become the country 's second president in 1829 .A fiercely liberal populist , he abolished slavery in Mexico but his term was cut short when he was ousted by a conservative coup .Today , both heroes ' respective African roots are ignored , and or , dismissed .There are also strong Pan Afro - American roots in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila where a group of black Seminoles settled after being chased from Florida , Oklahoma and Texas in the mid 1800s .Despite the often central roll played by African descended peoples in Mexico 's history many Mexicans believe their country had only had a handful of slaves , if any , who certainly have little to do with Mexico today .This cultural amnesia returns us to the current Memin stamp controversy .The focus thus far has been between Mexicans and Black Americans , but the fact is we have very little to do with the issue .Memin Pinguin is not maliciously racist like the many Sambo stories the U.S. produced earlier in the century .Had he been drawn with less nostalgia for that racist caricature we might be hailing the strip today as an example of the commercial potential of black characters among very broad audiences .But that troubling appearance , and the inability of what seems to be a majority of Mexico to even partially understand the offense it represents , demonstrates how far they have to go to truly come to terms with their heritage and all the parts of their diverse society .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"93.89612"}

{"text":"From op - eds and blogs to government officials and the stamp buying public , the Mexican response is one of defiance and annoyance .They see the protest to the Memin stamp as actions by ignorant Americans who know nothing of Mexican culture , and by opportunistic black leaders who are trying to use this to get attention .This opinion holds that the cartoon is n't intended to be offensive to anyone , and therefore it is n't .If anything , the publishers claim , Memin has improved its readers ' racial sensitivity , that the character 's \" exaggerated traits that prove a noble heart is what is important within a person . \"As readers follow Memin 's adventures they relate to his love for his mother and his loyalty to friends .By the end they feel so much affection for Memin that this affection somehow translates to all people .This naïve opinion is not news .It is the same argument used to defend the appreciation of Buckwheat , Amos and Hattie McDaniel 's various Mammy roles , along with other black characters of the Jim Crow era .For whatever humor and humanity these characters brought to audiences they come from an assumption of inferiority and disdain that can not be ignored .Memin Pinguin is not Buckwheat , but he draws on the same inspiration that created an international visual vocabulary for what it is to be black .Some argue that cartooning is the art of caricature and requires exaggeration .However , that argument always fails when one compares the variety of exaggerated features we see in white caricatures to the constant big - lipped buck - eyed grimace we find on black caricatures over and over .At the least these images demonstrate white artists ' noninterest in making nuanced black images , but at the worst they demonstrate something far more sinister .The fact is the basic composition of the pickaninny drawing came together during the turn of the 20th century just as Jim Crow laws were being codified in the U.S. and the European powers were busy scrambling to carve up Africa into colonies .Whatever humorous and or endearing feelings these images evoked in the buying public they also carried an implicit psychological justification for the morally offensive political programs in which western countries were engaged .Mexicans may argue that all of that has little to do with their country and their beloved Memin , but regardless of intention , Memin 's appearance is based so heavily on this pickaninny arch - type it ca n't help but recall all the negativity of the past .Truly the blindness to that past and its impact on black peoples everywhere is cause for more concern than the simple intention of cartoon character .Although the Mexicans who have rallied to the Memin stamp 's defense like to point out that it is the U.S. that is racist , this grossly ignores their own country 's continuing experience with racism .Mexico is not alone in this .Many in Latin America share this opinion , that they never had Ku Klux Klansmen lynching black people and thus their societies are n't racist .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"131.19131"}
