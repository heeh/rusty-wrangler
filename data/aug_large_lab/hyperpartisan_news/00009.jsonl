'Hill discusses several possible reasons , including \" position profiling \" , but eventually seems to settle on Jon Entine 's racial studies . 'Entine puts forth a theory that \" there are real differences in the gene frequencies in the east and west African population , which is quite different from populations around the world . \" ' The idea he believes is that because east and west Africans live in certain geographical regions , they have developed special \" athletic \" genes that make them naturally superior to white people in sports . 'Hmmm ... where have we heard similar theories before ? 'Ah yes , Sir Francis Galton believed the same basic things and used his own supposedly scientific studies to show that other races were mentally inferior to whites . 'Why do people keep trying to use genetics to differentiate between races ? 'Did n't we learn our lesson the last few times this happened ? 'Has everyone forgotten about eugenics , white supremacists , and the Nazi 's extermination of the Jews ? 'Jemele Hill needs to take a serious look at history and reconsider proposing such ridiculous theories that only lead to pain . 'Once people start thinking physical abilities are attributable to race , it 's a very small step to start linking mental abilities to race- and this is the pseudo - scientific theory that was the backbone of slavery in America .The article \" Whatever Happened to the White Tailback ? \" is not the first serious blunder that Jemele Hill has made either : she previously had said that \" cheering for the Celtics is like saying Hitler was a victim . \" ' ESPN suspended her for that comment ( which I do n't actually think was intended to be offensive , it was just an ill - thought out joke ) .

{"text":"I remember a few Around the Horn segments revolving around reporters getting in trouble for tweeting conjecture and innuendo , and these established reporters who are understandably a bit fearful of the same happening to them just end up being dry in their tweets .At the same time , I 'm a bit confused as to whom is leaching people away from ESPN with their tweets .However , I do n't necessarily want to hear all of the ESPN news that ESPN NEWS is fit to twit .This is where internet and twitter curation comes in .Curators are the people that actually sift through ALL THE STORIES , and find the ones that relate to a certain theme .ESPN probably ca n't do that from one twitter site because their viewers have specific sporting interests , that is why they need to interact with popular twitter accounts that repeat stories that ESPN first reports .Individuals find twitters with the specific sports blend that they are comfortable with .Those sporting news blends are just going to be different , there is no one size fits all .I would also suggest that people not confuse ESPN newscrapers with being the same thing as the actual source of the news story .I think Mr. Cuban is correct , but this is and should be a concern for all sports websites / aggregators / bloggers etc , not just the big guys like ESPN .For example : .In past years , i would scan Tim Dierkes MLBTR blog every few days .So at least 4 - 5 times per week , i was navigating to his website and ( indirectly ) viewing the ads on his website .I would scan the titles of all the posts and read the ones that appealed to me .Now , MLBTR is in my twitter feed , and because they list the player names in each twitter post , i ONLY navigate to his website if a specific post appeals to me .I visit his website likely 1 - 2 times per week now .So MLBTR has lost a significant percentage of my page views because of its twitter feed , but it must have the twitter feed to compete .I think you are right ; ESPN is nt going to be beaten , but the height of the walls surrounding the ESPN fortress is not as high .This is why they are forced to pay Simmons and Kiper and some of these guys so much money .What i think the writers should do , is get organized behind a reputable editor , and build and own their own media company .But by and large , they are unwilling ( or unable ) to forgo the short - term loss in salary , to take equity in something more long - term .I 'd love to hear how this is changing how you think about media relations from the perspective of the Mavericks .It would seem that giving access to \" reporters \" that have huge twitter followings rather than those with media credentials could be beneficial in building a base for the team .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.973526"}

Bush invited the Chicago Bulls to the White House to celebrate their NBA championship , Bulls guard Craig Hodges handed Bush a letter expressing outrage about the condition of urban America .While most pro athletes are silent on political issues , many team owners regard political involvement as essential to doing business .The emergence of professional players ' unions should have been a voice for athletes on political and social issues .According to Ed Garvey , who ran the NFL Players Association from 1971 until 1983 , racial turmoil was critical to the union 's early development .The union \" was driven by the African - American players , who knew there was an unwritten quota on most teams where there would not be more than a third blacks on any one team , \" says Garvey , who now practices law in Wisconsin . \"And they knew they would n't have a job with the team when their playing days were over .\" The players also understood that team owners were \" the most powerful monopoly in the country , \" he says .Garvey brought the association into the AFL - CIO - the only professional sports union to do so - to give the players a sense that they were part of the broader labor movement .In the early 1970s several NFL players walked the picket lines with striking Farah clothing workers , joined bank employees in Seattle to boost their organizing drive and took other public stands .But \" now they 're making enough money , so they want to keep their heads down , \" he says .When Marvin Miller , a former Steelworkers Union staffer , became the first executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association ( MLBPA ) in 1966 , he sought to raise players ' political awareness .\" We did n't just explain the labor laws , \" he recalls .\" We had to get players to understand that they were a union .We did a lot of internal education to talk to players about broader issues .\" But those days are long gone .Bouton believes that athletes ' unions now consider themselves partners in the sports business .They are \" part of the same club , \" Bouton says , negotiating mainly to give players a greater share of proceeds from ticket sales , television contracts and the marketing of player names and team logos .Donald Fehr , the MLBPA 's executive director , argues that players ' unions should stick to the issues that directly affect them .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"75.79491"}

{"text":"\" While traveling through Europe and the UK for extended periods of time , I 've often been quite envious of how respectful other countries are toward those with knowledge in the fields of science and the humanities .In the UK , for example , it 's generally not seen as \" uncool \" to have a higher degree from a good university .Often , it confers the degree - holder a certain social respect and admiration .Many of the top comedians in the UK have attended institutions like Oxford and Cambridge , including Michael Palin , Eric Idol , John Cleese , David Mitchell , Richard Ayoade and Stephen Fry .And shows such as \" QI , \" which combines academic discussions with uproarious , irreverent humor , are popular hits .Not only is the U.S. unique for its love affair with anti - intellectualism , but this romantic relationship appears to have grown stronger over the past few decades .A primary reason for this is no doubt the huge influence that conservative media have had on American culture , such as Fox News , which is currently the most trusted news network in the country .The problem is that \" Fox News \" is a misnomer .The network is , to quote Jon Stewart , more of a \" relentlessly activist \" organization for conservative causes than an intellectually honest conveyor of information .Indeed , there are to date at least seven academic studies that have found that Fox News ' viewership constitutes the most misinformed audience out there .From climate change to healthcare , the Iraq War to the country of Obama 's birth ( no , it 's not Kenya ) , denizens of Fox News are more confident about falsehoods than viewers of any other news network .Several studies even found a positive correlation between how often one watches Fox News and the degree to which one 's worldview is misinformed .What 's most dangerous about Fox News , though , is n't its cynical use of Orwellian doublespeak , as in \" Fair and Balanced \" and \" No Spin Zone , \" to conceal a conservative agenda .Nor is it the network 's repeated failure to accurately report the facts .Rather , the most dangerous consequence of Fox News is that it discourages that most important form of rigorous curiosity called critical thinking .If people want a single phenomenon to blame for the gradual decline of the American empire , direct your wagging finger at the devaluation of critical thinking skills .It 's not an accident that Fox News wants an audience that isn ' t preoccupied with carefully dissecting complex social , political , economic and religious issues .Critical thinking is perhaps our very best strategy for apprehending the true nature of reality , and as the great comedian Stephen Colbert once declared , \" reality has a well - known liberal bias . \"In other words , critical thinking could lead to liberalism - or worse , to that most dreaded form of liberal fanaticism called secular progressivism .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"78.5028"}

{"text":"What do civil rights have to do with pro football players ?What does the economic recession have to do with the Olympics ?Everything , says Dave Zirin , author of the new book Game Over : How Politics Has Turned the Sports World Upside Down .The first sports editor in the history of The Nation , Zirin has spent over a decade writing about the intersection of sports and politics .He argues that political and social issues have permeated sports at all levels , from youth leagues to the big leagues - and that it 's time for sports to be recognized as both a driver and reflection of social change .From This Story .President Barack Obama is presented with a team jersey by the Green Bay Packers ' quarterback Aaron Rodgers during a ceremony at the White House after Super Bowl XLV .( AP Photo / Pablo Martinez Monsivais ) .Around The Web .Related Content .The subtitle of your book is \" How Politics Has Turned the Sports World Upside Down .\" How have politics changed sports , and has it been for the better or worse ?It 's very different than it was just five years ago .A lot of the sports writing community has missed this , and missed it wildly .The sports world we 're looking at in 2013 is just different than the sports world of 2008 .There are a lot of reasons why this is the case , but there are three that I think have been most transformative - and there are positives and negatives that we can pull out of all three .The first is the 2008 economic crisis , the biggest recession in 80 years in this country .It turned the economics of sports on its head - there have been four lockouts in different years [ including the NFL referees ] , as owners in different sports have tried to restore profitability .There have been fewer public subsidies for stadiums , which were one of the pillars of sports profits for the last generation .There have been crises in every country where the Olympic or World Cup decided to land .The second one is the growth the LGBT movement in this country .We 've gone from 2008-where every candidate running for president talked about marriage equality as if it was a plague - to 2013 , when you have Barack Obama mentioning \" Stonewall \" in his inauguration speech .And this has been reflected in the world of sports .This goes back to Teddy Roosevelt , who popularized the term ' sissy ' for people who did n't play violent sports .So now , to see people like Steve Nash , Michael Strahan , Brendan Ayanbadejo , Scott Fujita , actually speaking out for LGBT rights , it has a very powerful cultural effect .The Vancouver Canucks just did a public service announcement about transgender awareness , and in the NCAA , a man named Kye Allums played for the women 's basketball team of George Washington - the first openly transgender player in the NCAA .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"88.102585"}

{"text":"How does Bryant 's extension affect the Lakers ' cap room and their quest to help Kobe win another championship to tie Michael Jordan 's 6 championships ?Using their views , let 's take a look at the Lakers ' current salary cap situation for this off - season .Lakers ' Current Salary Cap Situation .As Larry Coon noted , the Lakers currently have Kobe Bryant , Steve Nash , and Robert Sacre on books for next season , while Elias Harris has a non - guaranteed contract and Nick Young has a player option next season .The Lakers will also have a 1st round draft pick , which would fall to the 15th pick if season ended today at a cap hit of about $ 1.5 million .Here is the scenario that Larry Coon gives the Lakers to work with : .\" If they remove both [ Elias ] Harris and [ Steve ] Nash , their team salary will drop to about $ 34.44 million , which would give them about $ 28.46 million in cap room .This would give them the opportunity to sign one maximum - salary player , and a second player at around the mid - level amount .They would also be eligible to utilize the Room Mid - Level exception for around $ 2.7 million .\" Now , let 's say the Lakers use the Room Mid - Level exception on current SG Jodie Meeks , who is averaging 13.3 PPG and shooting 47.7 % from behind the three - point line this season .Also , lets assume the Lakers re - sign PG Jordan Farmar and F Wesley Johnson to veteran minimum deals .According to Eric Pincus , \" Their cap holds will be just $ 915,243 next summer ... the Lakers can negotiate small ( 7.5 % ) raises for each , if both sides are willing - after the team uses its cap room . \"Pincus also mentioned that C Pau Gasol and C / PF Jordan Hill 's cap holds stand at $ 20.3 million and $ 6.7 million respectively for this off - season .The Lakers would definitely need to renounce Gasol 's bird rights and possibly Hill 's also to make a legitimate run at a max - contract player .Furthermore , Gasol would need to accept a steep discount , approximately $ 5.5 million to $ 8 million per season , to have any chance to rejoin the Lakers under any scenario .After retaining Bryant , Young , Sacre , Meeks , Johnson , Farmar , and a 1st round pick before the 10-day July moratorium period ends , the Lakers would then maintain up to approximately $ 26.63 million of cap space to sign free agents this off - season .Using the facts obtained from Larry Coon 's and Eric Pincus ' columns , let 's see the most plausible route the Lakers can take from here .Scenario # 1 : Sign Carmelo Anthony and choose between Pau Gasol or Jordan Hill .After hours of studying the salary cap and analyzing multiple reports , Carmelo Anthony seems to be the one and only max player the Lakers can reasonably sign next summer .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"99.70763"}

{"text":"Do n't , please no , do n't its horrible \" was all the girl could say as the Doctor sat on the childs face and felt the giant turd break off and sandwich itself between her ass and Sally .Then , wriggling about a bit and feeling it spread itself she lifted off to examine the damage .It was almost impossible to know there was a face under the brown waste Rose thought and she loved it .So much so Rose reached round and scooped what little was left in her ass and wiped it on the girls mouth .Now eat some bitch or you 'll never get out of here \" screamed Rose , and within a few seconds she saw the girls mouth open .I ca nt Rose its just too horrible \" said the girl but as soon as she opened her mouth to speak The deviant Doc pushed a shit covered finger deep inside the girls mouth and held it there .Well you might as well lick this clean while its in your mouth hun then I 'll show you how to deal with the rest \" .Sally knew she did n't have a choice , and inhaled slowly .Then , to Roses amazement she saw the girls lips move and felt her finger being sucked on .Rose encouraged Sally to lick it good and the girl did just that .Rose slowly pulled her finger out the girls mouth and asked Sally to open wide while wiping some of the excess shit from the youngsters face .When she did Rose felt her clit pulsate as she saw her brown shit on the girls tongue and teeth .Ooo fuck yeah , that 's fucking horny Rose thought and let the girl sit up .The worsts over now hun \" said the doc wiping the girls eyes clear .\" Just open your eyes and try and breathe \" .Sally did and was looking right into the doctors eyes .The Doctor explained that she 'd always wanted to take a shit with someone watching and she could n't hold back any longer .She 'd always fingered her own ass and loved the taste of her own earthly mess and wanted to try more and that time was now here .So , without thinking Rose stuck her tongue out and ran it over the 14 year olds face gathering a really good amount of her own brown mess .Then she asked Sally to finger herself while she did the same and before long the Doc was chewing and sucking on her own shit .This woman was in her element now and soon went back to the childs face for more .This time using her fingers to stuff more and more into her mouth , gulping down the mess like it was manner from heaven .Sally just stared and swallowed for the first time since tasting Roses ass waste .Not as nasty as I first thought she said to herself , and seeing the Doctor in front of her munching on the brown waste she ran her 14 year old tongue over her lips and tasted some more .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"115.43851"}
