{"text":"Archives .National Navajo Code Talkers Day .Navajo code talkers in the U. S. Marine Corps relayed orders in the Navajo language on a field radio in the South Pacific .Cipher machines , or machines that create coded messages , did not work well in the jungles of the Pacific Islands during World War II .However , the United States military needed coded messages to send secret information from the battle lines to air bases and other locations .Native Americans who spoke the Navajo language helped solve this problem .The Navajo \" code talkers , \" as they became known , used English code words that they translated into their language to send messages .The Japanese military could hear these coded messages , but they could not understand their meanings .The Navajo language was not well known .The Navajo code talkers served in some of the fiercest battles of the Pacific .They saved many lives and helped the United States and its allies win the war .However , the code talkers were never allowed to discuss their work with anyone .Most Americans did not know about the code talkers ' role in World War II until much later .For their bravery and service , President Ronald Reagan set aside a special day to honor the Navajo code talkers .In 1982 , he declared August 14 to be National Navajo Code Talkers Day .Navajo Code Talker 's Day .August 14 is National Navajo Code Talker 's Day .It has n't always been so .On July 28 , 1982 , President Reagan declared August 14 National Navajo Code Talker 's Day .It was September 17 , 1992 when the Pentagon recognized the Code Talkers ' contribution .This delay was reportedly due to the \" continued value of their language as a security classified code .\" It was December 21 , 2000 that President Clinton signed into law the statute awarding the original 29 Navajo Code Talkers with Congressional Gold Medals - the highest civilian award in the United States .And it was July 2001 , when President Bush personally presented the Congressional Medal to four surviving Navajo code talkers in the Capitol Rotunda in Washington , DC .The fifth living code talker of the original 29 was unable to attend .Gold medals were also presented to relatives of the 24 code talkers no longer living .The Navajo code talkers were commended for their skill , speed , and accuracy .Major Howard Connor , 5th Marine Division signal officer , had 6 Navajo code talkers working 24×7 during the first two days of the Battle of Iwo Jima .They sent and received over 800 messages , all without error .Connor was later quoted as saying , \" Were it not for the Navajo , the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima . \"In an earlier blog post for Veteran 's Day , I mentioned the various other tribes that served as code talkers in times of war and shared a great video honoring the Navajo Code Talkers .I hope you 'll take a minute to revisit that post today .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"15.926578"}
