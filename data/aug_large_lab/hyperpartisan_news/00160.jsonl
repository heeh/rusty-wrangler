{"text":"The Baltimore Ravens are making noise about winning Super Bowl XLVII for retiring linebacker Ray Lewis .But the 49ers have their own favorite -- and spiritual center -- in veteran running back Frank Gore .Ask any 49ers player , offense or defense , how they feel about him and it 's like tapping into a wellspring of resolve for Gore as he approaches the most important football game of his life .The 29-year - old has persevered through a life of pain and hardship , both on the football field and off .But at long last , he can finally see the mountaintop .Win the Super Bowl next Sunday and he can stand on it for a while .He can look up and tell his beloved mother , Lizzie , who died in 2007 of kidney disease , that he has something really special for her this time . \"Since she passed , every time I score a touchdown I always point up and tell her it 's for her , \" Gore said this week .\" I mention that I love her .I know she 's happy .I 'm her son .We went through so much in high school , college and the NFL .Finally , I 'm getting the opportunity to play in the big game .\" Few thought Gore ever would .He was born and raised in a poor , drug - infested area of Coral Gables , Fla. , where many of his own relatives abused drugs .Lizzie was a single mother of three who often took in nieces and nephews , and Gore noted there were often as many as 11 or 12 people living in a one - bedroom apartment .\" I did n't know if I was going to get a bed , \" he said .\" I did n't know if the lights were going to be on .It was tough .\" Gore 's escape was athletics , particularly football , but despite a legendary career at Coral Gables High , he struggled academically because of a learning disability .He entered high school at a third - grade reading level , had to attend summer and night classes and undergo extensive tutoring just to qualify for college .Even though he worked diligently to get to a 10th - grade reading level , he still had trouble with written material .He failed to achieve the NCAA 's required minimum score on the SAT a few times .Finally , he was given the test orally and passed .He got a scholarship to nearby University of Miami , but more hardship ensued .After a promising freshman season , he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee .After working his way back the next year , he tore the ACL in his right knee .Even though he returned to rush for 948 yards and eight touchdowns as a junior , pro scouts were wary of Gore when he applied for the NFL draft in 2005 .Then general manager Scot McCloughan had to fight to convince the 49ers to draft Gore in the third round .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"113.75219"}
