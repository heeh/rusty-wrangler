Bush .Remember , we are in year eight of the Barack Obama administration .We need to be very , very careful about unintended consequences .Setting aside the feasibility of a campaign finance reform amendment , I think every proponent of free speech should consider what the potential consequences of such an amendment might be .You 're amending the Constitution to give the government the ability to ban speech .You can dress that argument up however you 'd like , but in reality , that would be exactly what you are doing .I know that some of this can come across as defeatist .I do n't believe getting money out of politics is all that realistic .And I think Sanders ' campaign structure is a pretty good example of why it might not be such a good idea to open the door wide to restrictions .He 's raising a ton of money from small - dollar donors , and making a strong case for his agenda .Meanwhile , a guy who has raised comparatively little money is dominating the race for his own party 's nomination because he has so much of his own that he does n't even care about raising from other people .I 'm not sure creating an environment in which the latter is incentivized would be such a good idea , either .Late Friday night , Robert Costa of the Washington Post reported that high - dollar donors , the elites of the Republican Party who mainstream political observers had long assumed would unite against Donald Trump in an effort to save the party from itself , had instead decided upon unconditional surrender .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"63.832962"}

{"text":"Citizens United is based on the assumption that 1 ) quid pro quo corruption is the only form of corruption that the government has a compelling interest in regulating or preventing ; and 2 ) independent expenditures do not lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption .As any one who has been around politics and witnessed the lack of any meaningful enforcement of anti - coordination rules can tell you , this is a ludicrous assumption .The other thing Citizens United did , which unfortunately has been largely ignored by the lower courts when it comes to state law , was generally uphold the federal disclosure scheme .( You 'll generally hear these groups referred to as \" dark money \" groups ) .All of this combines to give us a campaign finance system that is arguably worse than what existed before McCain - Feingold .About the only things that have survived are the ban on soft money for political parties , ( though not entirely ) , the increased contribution limits indexed to inflation , and the disclaimer which must air on every broadcast radio or television ad .( You know the one : I 'm [ candidate ] and I approve this message . )And so , it 's hardly a surprise that some liberals have taken up overruling Citizens United ( often said as \" repeal , \" which would be a legislative act ) as their chief cause .In the Presidential campaign , the cause has found a champion in Bernie Sanders ( though Hillary Clinton has also supported overruling Citizens United ) .He rails against a corrupt political system and vows to end the corrupt influence of money by appointing judges who would overrule Citizens United and Buckley , and pushing for a constitutional amendment to allow for strict campaign finance regulation .He 's right to be concerned about money in politics .He 's wrong about the solution .I do n't mean to pick on Bernie here .His position is no different than many other Democrats .But he 's a good example of what I 'm afraid too many Democrats and liberals are getting wrong about Citizens United in particular and campaign finance reform more broadly .Citizens United is not the source of our campaign finance problems .It did make things considerably more difficult , but the primary effect was to cut out the middleman when it comes to corporate independent expenditures .The effect is not all that different than the soft money which McCain - Feingold tried to ban , except now the spending is in the hands of nominally independent committees , instead of the political parties .Which brings us to our next point : Even if Citizens United is overruled , likely through a challenge of a state law , Super PACs will not go away on their own .For one thing , Citizens United itself did n't create Super PACs , and federal campaign finance law probably wo n't be at issue if and when Citizens United is overruled .The FEC is probably unlikely to enforce a law that was struck down by the Supreme Court , even if the decision had been subsequently overruled .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"73.65895"}

Freyd .More info about this concept here : .Thanks for speaking about this topic .Supporting a friend or loved one who is struggling with an abusive relationship can literally save their life .I 'm aware of DARVO and I think blaming a victim for the abuse they 've received is par for the course .I do n't believe my ex ever told anyone else that I abused him , but he certainly told stories of mistreatment and betrayal , and on those occasions I tried to address his behaviour , he would always spin things so that it was my fault .He would repeatedly accuse me of nagging , which was exactly what he did - he never let me have any peace , supervised and criticised my every move and complained about every aspect of my behaviour , looks , language and demeanor .Even with the violence , he would always recall events as if I had physically cornered him , was berating him with \" verbal violence \" or even that he was trying to stop me hurting myself .In reality , absolutely every incident of violence was extremely sudden , after a short exchange or none at all , and of course , I was never in any danger of hurting myself .However , although gender is massive factor in all abuse , I do n't believe that the particular tactic you describe - crying abuse - is unique or even particularly favoured by men .After all , to be the victim of domestic violence is still hugely stigmatised and particularly so for male victims .Speaking out about experiences of domestic violence always carry social risk - some people wo n't believe you , others will think you 're making a fuss over nothing .This risk is even greater for men - a lot of people just ca n't conceive of a woman really harming a man .So although I am sure there are male abusers who do claim to have been abused , I think bad men have more likely weapons at their disposal .Meanwhile , I believe it is very important to believe people , unless and until we have a really good reason not to .I do n't think gender is such a reason .Comforting Thoughts About Death That Have Nothing to Do with God . \" In this book Greta Christina tackles the subject of death with the insight of a philosopher and the relaxed candor of a friend - that really cool , intelligent friend who understands and cares . \"","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"79.34435"}

Bach or King Solomon ( PBUH ) for example but this abuse calls for redemption .The first wife should always Marry with the promise before the witnesses that the husband always asks her permission unless they do not love each other any more later and there is a seperation .Its a duty to ALLAH that comes first though , and very strict for the brothers to support the wives .Un fortunatly , this is impossible for any human bieng since it envolved having marriages at the same time and supporting the men and feeding children too .Be that as it may , that 's why I believe that religious books should restrict themselves to a few fundamental good deeds , and leave the rest to people to decide what is best for them .Because these things change with time and locale .In practice , that 's really what happens .For example , all these quotes from Koran are well and good , but many would be illegal in countries like USA .Mormons still practice polygammy in the U.S. so the so called war on islam is and was a secret war all along .Also , the U.S.A has adopted more Islamic laws then any other western countries , -Equal rights , -Freedom of speech , where woman still can not talk to a priest today .-Non discrimination of race or the sexes , I can go on .... .sound slike Statan 's tribe ?It is not in anyones right to Judge Islam , Believers ( Muslims , Jews or christians ) and or even ALLAH ( God ) by the mistakes people make ., we are all here to over come the tests with abstinence over lusts .I believe Islam 's guidelines also prohibit also the arab tribal or religious sect ideas of man made laws like for example \" pre marriage arrangements \" with the prides face covered .There are most parts of the world where the proportion to men and women are equal except certian regions like Irag or Afghanistan where more men have been killed in war .In places like Saudi Arabia where some Muslims have more money and can marry more than one wife , the chance for poorer men to marry is much more diffucult .A rich guy might have 2,3 or even 4 wives and a lower class worker guy might not be able to find a wife at all , leading him to sin .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"98.48978"}
