{"text":"Key Findings .The following discussion focuses on the 2,381 individuals in our study who had received DACA by the time they filled out the survey .DACA Increases Opportunity .Without Social Security Numbers or the ability to work legally in the United States , undocumented young adults did not previously have access to a wide range of resources and opportunities afforded to their legal peers .However , since receiving DACA , these young adult immigrants have become more integrated into the nation 's economic and social institutions .Almost 60 percent of DACA beneficiaries surveyed have obtained a new job since receiving DACA , and 45 percent have increased their earnings .These findings provide direct evidence of the economic boost provided by DACA .Because new jobs and increased earnings translate into a greater tax base , DACA is also providing an important boost to the economy .Internships .Our results also show that just over one - fifth of NURP respondents ( 21 percent ) have obtained an internship since DACA , which likely provides some valuable career training not typically available for young adults with limited employment histories .Driver 's Licenses .Additionally , 57 percent have obtained a driver 's license .The ability of DACA beneficiaries to legally drive means better safety for all drivers .This important form of access has also likely widened beneficiaries ' educational , employment , and other options .Miguel was born in Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico .He came to the U.S. with his two parents and older brother when he was six years old .Growing up in El Monte , California , Miguel worked hard in school .He graduated from his high school in 2011 , and started taking classes at a local community college - the first in his family to pursue higher education .DACA was initiated during Miguel 's first year of college .With a work permit he started working at a print shop and was able to enroll as a full - time student .Having a driver 's license also made life much easier for Miguel .In Southern California , one could easily spend two or more hours a day on the bus .After working for a year and establishing credit , Miguel pooled his money together with his father and they opened up a cell phone store in nearby La Puente .Miguel is also hoping to start his own business as a web designer and app developer .He credits DACA for providing opportunities to work and drive , as he strives for a better future for himself and his family .Bank Accounts and Credit Cards .Meanwhile , almost half of our DACA beneficiaries ( 49 percent ) have opened their first bank account , and one - third ( 33 percent ) have obtained their first credit card .While undocumented immigrants are not necessarily prohibited from opening bank accounts , many banks require an identification number and a picture ID .The new forms of identification obtained through DACA allow young people to overcome bureaucratic hurdles and to avoid sometimes awkward or uncomfortable situations .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"40.820053"}

{"text":"Our recommendation would have the same effect of annually adjusting the private university Cal Grant .Moreover , the formula we recommend ensures that the state provides about the same level of support for all financially needy students regardless of whether they attend a private or public university .It does this by linking the private university grant directly to the General Fund subsidy the state provides to financially needy students attending UC and CSU .Stops Devaluation of Award .As Figure 7 shows , the last time the state increased the maximum private university Cal Grant award was in 2000 - 01-when the award was raised from $ 9,420 to $ 9,708 .Given inflation , the real value of the award therefore has declined 6 percent over the last four years .The Governor 's budget proposal would reduce the award in real terms by an additional 45 percent - dropping the award to its lowest value in more than a decade .By comparison , our recommendation both retains the real value of the award and links it to an underlying policy basis that treats financially needy students fairly and consistently .Fiscal Effect of Adopting Long - Term Private University Cal Grant Policy .Our recommendation would increase Cal Grant costs by $ 1.5 million over the current - year level .However , the Governor 's grant - reduction proposal would achieve $ 32.7 million in savings .Thus , relative to the Governor 's budget , our recommendation would result in a $ 34.3 million General Fund cost .As Figure 1 indicates , our alternative aid package identifies sufficient resources to cover this cost and still achieve net General Fund savings .The Governor 's budget proposes to decouple the Cal Grant for UC and CSU students from the systemwide student fee level at each of the segments .Thus , rather than increasing the public university Cal Grant to cover the proposed 10 percent fee increases , the maximum Cal Grant for students attending UC and CSU would remain at the current - year levels of $ 4,984 and $ 2,046 , respectively .In other words , although the Governor 's budget proposes fee increases , it does not propose a corollary increase to the value of the UC and CSU Cal Grant .We estimate this results in $ 18.7 million of cost avoidance in 2004 - 05 .Rather than decoupling the public university Cal Grant from the University of California and the California State University 's systemwide fee level , we recommend the Legislature adhere to existing law and existing budgeting practice and increase the grant to cover the entire systemwide fee .This would send the clear and consistent message that financially needy students at all three public higher education segments will continue to receive full student fee coverage .Rather than decoupling the public university Cal Grant from UC and CSU 's systemwide fee level , we recommend the Legislature increase the grant to the proposed 2004 - 05 systemwide fee levels at UC and CSU .This would increase the Cal Grant for UC students from its current - year level of $ 4,982 to $ 5,482 , and it would increase the Cal Grant for CSU students from its current - year level of $ 2,046 to $ 2,250 .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"67.73991"}
