{"text":"Shakita Mangham and Furaha Love , both 25 , have now acknowledged that they left their children alone , without a baby - sitter , according to police affidavits released yesterday .Ms. Love admitted to police that the two women went drinking , knowing that the children were home alone , according to her affidavit .Three of Ms. Mangham 's children and two of Ms. Love 's died in the fire in the early hours of June 12 at Ms. Mangham 's home at 6429 Winslow St. .Initially , both women told police that they had left the children in the care of a teenager from the neighborhood , but later both acknowledged they had lied to cover up the fact that they left the younger children in the care of their 8-year - old sons .Jevon Irwin , Ms. Mangham 's eldest child , and Huedon Chambliss , Ms. Love 's son , survived the fire .Ms. Mangham was arraigned on charges that include five counts of involuntary manslaughter , two counts of reckless endangerment , four counts of child endangerment and one count of filing false reports .Bail for her was set at $ 10,000 .She posted bond of $ 1,000 -- 10 percent -- and was released yesterday afternoon .A preliminary hearing is set for 8:30 a.m. next Friday .Ms. Love , of Hazelwood , was arraigned last night on nearly identical charges , except she faces only three counts of child endangerment .Her bail also was set at $ 10,000 .Ms. Mangham 's defense attorney , James M. Ecker , declined to discuss details of the case .Ernest H. Sharif , Ms. Love 's attorney , maintains that neither woman should be charged with homicide , because neither of them caused the fatal fire .Involuntary manslaughter is a death caused by recklessness or gross negligence , and is the least serious degree of homicide under Pennsylvania law .\" There 's no connection with the mother being outside the home , \" Mr. Sharif said .\" There 's no causation between the mother being outside the home and the death of the children .The children died of fire .And the mother did n't set the fire . \"He said had an adult been home , but asleep , the children still could have died in a fire .\" But what happens is , this is an emotionally charged case where you have five children who are dead , and we do n't like where the mother was .So , emotionally , we try to make a connection .But legally , there is no connection . \"County prosecutors and city police declined comment yesterday .He also said he was concerned about the risk created for firefighters at the blaze .Investigators had considered the possibility that the surviving children , Jevon and Huedon , could have caused the blaze while playing with matches .According to the affidavit , however , Ms. Mangham believes it 's likely that her daughter , Daekia Holyfield , 7 , one of the five who died in the fire , may have been the child who started it .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"66.9974"}
