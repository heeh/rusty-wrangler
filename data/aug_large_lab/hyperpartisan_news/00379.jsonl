{"text":"To make matters more complicated , the New Testament offers little help on the question of immigration reform .Many love to quote Jesus ' words in Matthew 25 , believing them particularly relevant to the discussion of immigration reform because of the use of the word \" sojourner \" or \" stranger \" ( Matthew 25:35 , 38 , 43 - 44 ) .These folks interpret the idea that we should care for \" the least of these \" as a parallel to the command that we should love our neighbor .Therefore , they conclude , it 's clear teaching from Jesus to accept any who come to America .Christians should care for \" the least , \" but Matthew 25 is not teaching that truth .And even if it were , it 's a misapplication that America should accept any and all comers .And while Christians are commanded to love their neighbor , we must never let love become permission for lawlessness .This is where modern notions of Christian love for immigrants runs afoul of biblical notions of love for sojourners .Many liberal Christians and politicians , and a few conservatives , would have us love - that is , accept - every immigrant that enters our borders , whether legally or illegally .But that was not the case in the Old Testament .Sojourners were accepted and given certain legal rights because their intention was to become full - fledged members of the nation , learning the ways and language of Israel , and respecting its laws , taboos , and customs .Beyond that , Jesus ' teaching in Matthew 25 and the repeated command in the New Testament to love our neighbor ( Luke 10:27 ; Galatians 5:14 ) is directed to individuals , not governmental authorities whose responsibility is to make , administer , and adjudicate laws .This does n't mean that immigration policy should be draconian , denying the dignity of the immigrant .But it does means that what is required of individual American Christians as a matter of obedience is not necessarily required of the American nation as a matter of law .Any conversation about the Bible and immigration reform must separate the responsibilities of the individual from that of the nation , taking into account a comprehensive view of biblical truth , not just a few selected verses quoted out of context and sloppily applied by political talking heads .Derrick G.
