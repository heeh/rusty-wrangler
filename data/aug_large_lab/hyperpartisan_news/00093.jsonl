{"text":"Sikh Temple Shooting Suspect Amped Up on Legal Drugs ?The violent and horrendous acts committed by mass shooters are beyond daunting and incomprehensible to the average person , and for good reason .It ultimately takes some degree of mind alteration to even consider such acts , whether it be through hardcore pharmaceutical ingestion or a serious state of mental illness brought upon by outside influences .Beyond the simple fact that the shooters are taking the drugs , also , is the more important fact that the makers of these drugs have been covering up the true side effects associated with their use for decades .Side effects that include the following for anti - depressants like Prozac alone : . -Suicidal behavior - Suicidal thoughts - Violent actions and reckless behavior .And once again , these were side effects that up until 2005 , when Harvard psychiatrist Martin Teicher blew the whistle on the cover up , were completely hidden from the public .As detailed in the USA Today article on the subject , Teicher explains how Prozac manufacturer Eli Lilly & Co. lied for 15 years denying the very real link between Prozac and suicide .In his own words , Teicher said that the public was being treated like \" guinea pigs \" in a mass experiment .The BBC even reported back in 2000 that Prozac ' led to suicide ' , one of many reports on the subject .And it does n't end with Prozac .It was exposed that another leading anti - depressant drug Paxil was associated with violent behavior back in 2006 .Mulitple lawsuits and voiced concerns later , the use of anti - depressants is actually growing exponentially each year .Meanwhile , virtually all massacre shooters are known to have been taking them , including : . -Columbine shooter Eric Harris - Kip Kinkel - Ted Kaczinski the \" Unabomber \" - Michael McDermott - John Hinckley , Jr. - Byran Uyesugi - Mark David Chapman - Charles Carl Roberts IV , the Amish school killer .And this is not a complete list .It 's very easy to see that a trend is indeed present , and while many factors go into such a horrible incident , it 's important that we take a serious look at the link between these shootings and the abuse of ' legal ' drugs .Amnesty for 11 million will increase debt by $ 6.3 trillion And that does n't count costs of 22 million additional legal immigrants in just 10 years !A Nation of of 3rd World Broke A@@es \" AmeriKa \" can not afford an Invasion of Broke A@@es from the 3rd World .\" Of course , Sikhs adhere to a completely different religion than Muslims but that has n't stopped them falling victim to a number of racially charged attacks since September 11 , 2011 .Despite the fact that a number of different eyewitnesses reported multiple shooters , the narrative of the lone gunman , a disgruntled US Army veteran , has now been fixed .This conveniently dovetails with recent efforts by the feds to demonize returning veterans as potential terrorists , which itself is part of the wider move to smear conservatives as domestic extremists .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"101.13499"}
