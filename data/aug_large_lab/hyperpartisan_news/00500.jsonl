Lee Jr. and Jefferson Davis that populate the South Mall .The Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez statues were both erected in the past 15 years , after the overt segregation that had once been the rule at the University had disappeared .UT 's recent strides forward , as evidenced by the King and Chavez statues , stand in striking relief against the backdrop of Confederate heritage .In 2010 the administration renamed a dormitory , Simpkins Hall , which had been named for a prominent Klansman .Lawsuits lodged against UT for policies on race , such as Fisher v. Texas and Hopwood v. Texas , take objection with the University 's diversity policies , a far cry from the Sweatt v.

Reagan must go .John H. who ?I certainly did n't know until I read his inscription .Reagan was the postmaster general of the Confederate States , and after the war he publicly called for Texans to renounce both slavery and secession .He was also the first chairman of the Railroad Commission of Texas .If that does n't set your blood to boiling , I do n't know what does .A fifth statue , which was installed in 1955 , about two decades later than the others , is of George Washington .Like all the rest , Washington was a Southerner and a slave owner , but he gets a pass because he left a will that freed his slaves upon the death of himself and his wife .The only controversial thing about the Washington statue is that at a certain angle , the handle of his sword , held in a firm grip , is thought by some wags to resemble a physical attribute befitting the father of his country .Two other statues on UT 's grassy knoll have n't drawn any fire , so far as I know .Woodrow Wilson was Mr. Everything in his day , including the president of Princeton University , the governor of New Jersey , and a two - term president of the United States .Among the criticism sometimes directed at Wilson is the fact that he allowed a viewing of The Birth of a Nation in the White House .( This kind of cherry - picking of the historical record makes everybody vulnerable ; Abe Lincoln , the greatest secular saint in America , liked to tell racist jokes . )One of the accomplishments on Wilson 's stone CV , by the way , is \" Founder of the League of Nations .\" Talk about lost causes .Exempting Washington , Hogg , and Wilson , that leaves the offending four , who are all there because of the Confederate loyalties of one man : George Washington Littlefield , an early regent of the university .Littlefield grew up on a plantation and later owned slaves himself .During the Civil War he served under Albert Sidney Johnston and nearly died at the Battle of Mossy Creek ( Johnston was killed at Shiloh , in 1862 ) .During Reconstruction , Littlefield enjoyed great success in the new cattle industry in West Texas and made a ton of money in banking .As a regent , he wielded power and influence .His chief rival was another George Washington , George Washington Brackenridge .A Unionist whose brothers owned slaves , Brackenridge did not fight in the Civil War but instead spent those years making a fortune in the cotton trade in South Texas and , later , in banking .During his 27-year tenure as a regent of the university , he wanted UT to abandon its Southern connections .The two men of opposing views and temperaments were at loggerheads over Littlefield 's support for developing a history curriculum that would emphasize the study of the South .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"77.345856"}

{"text":"Seale also submitted a list of statues to replace the deposed .He would retain only Washington ( a slaveholder ) and the Littlefield Fountain ( dedicated to Confederates ) .Seale argues that his nominees all have something to do with UT , unlike several of the statues .But his first suggestion , Stephen F. Austin , had nothing to do with UT or even with the city of Austin .Plus , Austin supported slavery , politically if not personally ; the families he brought in to settle Texas were , in the main , slave owners .It was Mirabeau B. Lamar , a much overlooked figure , who was instrumental in deciding that the Capitol would be located in a city named after the Father of Texas .Seale 's other nominees at least have UT connections , but there are problems with one of them : Governor Oran Roberts , who was in office when UT opened for business , in 1883 , and who later taught at the university .But goodness , his Confederate credentials would surely arouse controversy .Roberts , after all , was president of the Secession Convention in 1860 and played a major role in leading Texas out of the Union .As for the other names , Harry Ransom already has a building named after him .Heman Sweatt , the first African American admitted to the law school , makes a lot of sense .But Seale 's list does not include a UT - based Mexican American , and this is a serious oversight .( Cesar Chavez , a statue of whom is in the works , does not count except generically , his and Jennifer Lopez 's being possibly the only Hispanic names recognizable to large segments of the student population . )If we are to have new statues , I nominate one dedicated to Américo Paredes , the distinguished folklorist , professor , and author who taught English and anthropology at the university for many years . \"History has many cunning passages , \" wrote T. S. Eliot , and Texas and the university are tied to the South , like it or not .But while I 'm at it , here are some other suggestions for solving UT 's persistent Southern discomfort .First of all , we have to get rid of references to the Forty Acres , because this phrase echoes a conflicted bit of Southern history : the forty acres and a mule that were promised to blacks in Southern states following the Civil War .Spike Lee 's production company is called 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks , and rappers riff on the phrase all the time .As for the statues themselves - those erections lasting more than four decades - and the rest of the campus , here are my own heartfelt proposals : .Turn the Tower and the Main Building 180 degrees so that instead of facing south , UT would look toward Oklahoma .Replace all representational statues on campus-99 percent of the total statuary - with abstract sculptures that no one would have anything to say about , like an outdoor Bauhaus exhibition .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"81.39203"}
