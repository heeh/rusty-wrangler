Dobriansky , undersecretary for democracy and global affairs , came at a time when the Pentagon was increasingly taking over control of post - invasion planning from the State Department .It reflected the growing tensions between State Department and Pentagon officials and their disparate assessments about the challenges looming in post - invasion Iraq .The question of whether the United States planned adequately for the post - invasion occupation echoes today , as the insurgency continues to challenge U.S. policy in Iraq .Many senior State Department officials are still bitter about what they see as the Pentagon 's failure to take seriously their planning efforts , particularly in the \" Future of Iraq \" project .The memo was one of several documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and made public yesterday by the National Security Archive , a nonprofit research group .Other documents detail the specifics of the Future of Iraq project , which brought together Iraqi exiles and U.S. experts in an attempt to plan for such things as a new banking system , a new military and a new constitution .In the memo , the three bureau chiefs offered to provide technical assistance to help the Central Command develop new plans to ensure law and order as well as humanitarian aid after the invasion .They said they had also raised the potential problems with retired Army Lt .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"59.629257"}

{"text":"( Full story ) RELATED POSTINGS .Washington , DC , February 20 , 2014 - A major controversy during the administration of President George W. Bush concerned the use or misuse of intelligence with regard to Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs and possible links between Iraq and al - Qaida .The best known elements of that controversy were Iraqi motivations behind the procurement of aluminum tubes , whether Iraq had sought to acquire uranium from Niger , if Iraq was seeking to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program , and whether it was producing and stockpiling chemical or biological weapons .But another aspect of that controversy involved two components of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy - the Office of Special Plans and the Policy Counterterrorism Evaluation Group ( PCTEG ) .During the Bush administration , and after , there have been numerous accounts that either confused the functions of those offices or attributed actions to them that they never undertook .Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith .One potential cause for confusion is that the term \" Special Plans \" has been a euphemism for deception since World War II , and for ' perception management ' ( which included deception and ' truth projection ' ) since at least the mid-1970s .And during the George W. Bush administration the term apparently had a dual use - as a traditional euphemism ( for perception management ) as well as a temporary title for planning with regard to Iraq , Iran , and counterterrorism .Deception & Special Plans , 1946 - 1980 .As noted , the term Special Plans was used as a euphemism for deception going back to at least World War II .In March 1944 , General Omar Bradley , commander of the U.S. 12 th Army Group , established a Special Plans section to \" prepare and implement deception and cover plans for all United States forces in the United Kingdom . \" Post - war use of the term is illustrated by the existence , in December 1948 , of the Special Plans Section of the Strategy Branch of Headquarters U.S. Air Force .Over two years earlier , in the summer of 1946 , the absence of organizations to conduct cover and deception operations was the subject of several War Department memos .A Top Secret July 5 , 1946 memo ( Document 1 ) from the Office of the Chief of Staff assigned responsibility for the supervision of War Department cover and deception matters to the Director of Plans and Operations .Three days later , the department 's Adjutant General directed ( Document 2 ) that the commanding general of the Army Ground Forces manage tactical deception activities - that is deception during battle , and those which might involve radio , sonic , or camouflage deception .Two further memos from the same period of time addressed the issue of establishing a cover and deception organization for the Army Air Forces ( AAF ) .A memo ( Document 3 ) from the assistant chief of the air staff for intelligence notes the role of cover and deception in World War II , the absence of an organization to conduct such activities , and the need to establish one .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"65.89013"}

Edelman .31 The response , as published in the Inspector General 's report , consisted of the comments on the draft version of the report but serve as a response to the final report in the many areas where the two were the same .Among the comments was the assertion that the briefing 's reference to a \" cooperative \" relationship between Iraq and al - Qaida \" was consistent with the DCI 's own comments to Congress in 2002 and 2003 . \"He also objected that , since no laws were broken or DoD directives violated , there was no reason to characterize the work as inappropriate .Conclusion .The term \" special plans \" was coined over seventy years ago as a euphemism for deception , and subsequently became a euphemism for perception management , one element of which was deception .Thus , confusing actual or potential enemies was always an objective of special plans activities .During the George W.

{"text":"An enabling strategy with the proper emphasis on by , with , and through the central government diminishes the risk of this footprint virus .According to Dave Ochmanek , senior RAND analyst and symposium speaker , insurgency or other IW activity now threatens ( or has done so recently , or will do so in the future ) roughly half of the approximately 190 nations in the United Nations .22 Potentially this is a very broad arena for BPC engagement , but numbers alone can prove misleading without a keen assessment to establish actual conditions .We commonly err by assuming that the best solution calls for a mirror image of our own force - perhaps true in some circumstances but a poor assumption to make without a validating assessment .Planners therefore not only should understand the target nation 's requirements , but also should have a clear understanding of that nation 's ability to learn , operate , and sustain programs developed with US assistance .Many nations at risk are not credible candidates for high - tech transfers and sophisticated platforms because they lack either a justifying threat or the structural and demographic capacities to maintain and operate these air , space , and cyber systems .Assuming that only old systems have viability would prove equally wrong .In BPC the correct answer involves providing the right tech rather than low tech or high tech .The current USAF inventory emphasizes high tech , thus constraining the available options for BPC through technical transfer .Aircraft do not constitute the sole case for BPC , but they have typically served as the airpower lead - in for the associated training , doctrine , and long - term military - to - military relationships that have enabled both US objectives and host - nation security .The Vietnam - era platforms that gave the USAF this entry are gone or rapidly disappearing , and potential partners with limited resources and little justification for the high - tech aircraft typically found in the current USAF inventory now look to foreign rather than US suppliers to provide relevant , COIN - capable platforms .Certainly we can employ other USAF competencies in BPC ( air traffic control in Africa , for instance ) , but the diminishing market for US aircraft should remain a concern .Realistically , the new right - tech platform may be an unmanned aerial system , but to create the opening for a long - term enabling plan , the USAF should first develop a strategy for exportable COIN technologies .If the F-20 legacy still applies , it also means that the USAF should operate these platforms in its own inventory .Recommendations .Naming some suitable platform would be a seductive first choice for beginning discussions of how airpower can contribute to COIN , but USAF expertise and the potential for engagement go well beyond the technical flight - line engagement by operations and maintenance personnel .Actually controlling airspace or maintaining sovereign control of that space , for example , remains an issue in most of Africa outside of terminal areas .In concert with the International Civil Aviation Organization and Federal Aviation Administration , the USAF is uniquely suited to assess , advise , and assist in this area .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"66.66212"}

Louise Rees and their Information Digest newsletter are perhaps the best known practitioners in this field .The LaRouchians are publicly shunned by many on the political right , but their information regularly showed up in right wing ( and a few left wing ) publications .There are scores of right - wing magazines , newspapers , and newsletters that ply the reader with tales of progressive plots to plunder free enterprise in America .These include the weekly newspaper Human Events , newsletters from Beverly LaHaye 's Concerned Women for America , Reed Irvine 's Accuracy in Media , the Schlafly family 's Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation , Fred Schwarz 's Christian Anti - Communism Campaign , and Phyllis Schlafly 's Eagle Forum .There are hundreds of other periodicals , as well as publications such as books , pamphlets , and flyers .In the past , films , filmstrips , and slide shows were circulated .As they became more popular and relatively inexpensive , audiotapes and videotapes have been utilized , and a few computerized telecommunications networks and bulletin board systems have emerged .Radio talk shows and syndicated radio and television programs reach large audiences , with Rush Limbaugh , Pat Robertson , Chuck Harder and Tom Valentine among the major information sources attacking liberal conspiracies .Every week there are dozens of direct mail appeals with gossipy tidbits about leftist treachery and predicting doom if checks are not in the mail to help counter the subversion .A number of rightist think tanks , membership organizations , lobbying groups , trade and professional groups , internship centers , direct mail concerns , and a handful of academic institutions create a permanent institutional infrastructure to keep counter - subversive theories alive and fresh .A leading purveyor of counter - subversion theories during the Reagan Adminstration was the Heritage Foundation and its various publications including Policy Review .Others include the Hoover Institution at Stanford , and the Foreign Policy Research Institute ( FRPI ) at the University of Pennsylvania .The FPRI journal Orbis was particularly of interest due to its glorification of authoritarian solutions to numerous problems .The Free Congress Foundation run by New Right strategist Paul Weyrich circulates many publications that reflect its ultra - conservative , reactionary and narrow fundamentalist views .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.53076"}

{"text":"This imperative for centralizing planning and direction while decentralizing tactical - employment decisions has as much applicability to IW as to traditional warfare operations .The rationale for this fundamental belief should roll off a professional Airman 's tongue as easily as , say , a Marine officer would justify the inviolability of the Marine air - ground task force .The fire hose of effects available from airpower operations can be focused where and when needed , according to the priorities established by the joint force commander .Decisions regarding particular employment methods and tactics will reside at a lower level , closer to the fight and to the knowledge of what is needed .Most of airpower 's contributions in Iraq focus on support for ground forces , but unique abilities allow it to conduct both interdependent and independent operations .All of this is available on an as - needed basis , almost without regard for geography or artificial surface boundaries .Since the beginning of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom , Central Command 's air component has flown over a half million combat and combat - support sorties .Though impressive , that number does not tell the whole story .First , many of these sorties are of long duration , supplying unprecedented persistence and presence overhead , ultimately enabled through a combination of air refueling and forward basing .One can not under­estimate the criticality of being able to choose from among a variety of weapons and tools and respond rapidly , particularly in an IW environment in which the enemy very often dictates the time , place , and nature of attacks .Second , and more importantly , sortie counts or similar metrics can not readily depict many of the effects that the Air Force brings to the fight .Although impressive , statistics represent only one part of the Air Force 's contribution in today 's war .We must not overlook either the robust intelligence analysis and dissemination capabilities that leverage the unprecedented collection afforded by today 's Air Force systems or the communications - enabling functions that make global warfare as seamless as if it were in our own backyard .Employing Airpower 's Capabilities Space - based assets rank among the least understood and recognized of the Air Force 's war - fighting contributions .Vital intelligence , communications , weather , and navigation capabilities all rely heavily on assured access to space .Space - based force multipliers are proving immensely valuable at the lower end of the conflict spectrum .Take for example the GPS - it is not only critical to providing guidance for precision munitions but also vital to reporting the geolocation of friendly troops , insurgents , and civilians .Precision location allows more rapid responses for close air support , combat search and rescue , casualty evacuation , and prosecution of time - sensitive targets .Yet , a determined , capable adversary could challenge access to space , as the Chinese reminded the rest of the world with their recent antisatellite demonstration .Intelligence made available by air and space forces serves as a critical enabler in IW .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.98134"}

Gen. Douglas E. Lute , the top operations officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff .Lute , though , was not supportive of the troop surge ordered by the Bush administration in 2007 , leaving some to wonder why he was selected for the job .During President George W. Bush 's first term , National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice was often at the center of the administration 's most controversial moments .Following the Sept. 11 attacks , national security officials were some of the most scrutinized by media and lawmakers , who wanted to know how the federal government allowed such an attack to happen .Rice 's actions in particular were examined , especially after it was revealed that two months earlier , in July 2001 , CIA Director George Tenet had briefed Rice in an emergency meeting at the White House about the potential threat of an al Qaeda attack .When asked about the meeting in 2006 , Rice claimed that she did not recall the specific meeting and that she had met repeatedly with Tenet that summer about terrorist threats .She insisted it was \" incomprehensible \" that she had ignored terrorist threats two months before 9/11 .In March 2004 , Rice refused to testify before the 9/11 Commission .Under pressure , President Bush agreed to allow Rice to testify , making her the first sitting National Security Advisor to testify on matters of policy .In April 2007 , Rice rejected , on grounds of executive privilege , a House subpoena regarding the false prewar claim that Iraq sought yellowcake uranium from Niger .In 2003 , Rice became one of the most vocal members of the Bush administration as it made its case for going to war against Iraq .After Iraqi officials declared before the United Nations that it had no weapons of mass destruction in December 2002 , Rice wrote an editorial published in The New York Times , \" Why We Know Iraq Is Lying . \"Shortly after taking office in 2001 , President George W. Bush selected a controversial figure from the Reagan years - Elliott Abrams - to serve on the National Security Council .Abrams , who pled guilty in 1991 to withholding information from Congress during its investigation of the scandal , was selected as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Near East and North African Affairs .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"72.58347"}

{"text":"But Hadley did not assume responsibility for overseeing the nation 's top military priorities - Iraq and Afghanistan .Instead , President Bush decided to create the position of assistant to the president and deputy national security advisor , or \" war czar , \" as some began to call it , who would report directly to him on military operations in the two countries .The only problem was that no one wanted the job .Administration officials approached no less than five four - star generals about the position and all of them turned it down .That included retired Marine Gen. John J. \" Jack \" Sheehan , a former top NATO commander , who told The Washington Post : \" The very fundamental issue is , they do n't know where the hell they 're going . \"Sheehan said he believed that Vice President Dick Cheney and his hawkish allies remained more powerful within the administration than pragmatists looking for a way out of Iraq . \"So rather than go over there , develop an ulcer and eventually leave , I said , ' No , thanks , ' \" he said .Eventually , President Bush found a taker - Lt . Gen. Douglas E. Lute , the top operations officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff .Lute , though , was not supportive of the troop surge ordered by the Bush administration in 2007 , leaving some to wonder why he was selected for the job .During President George W. Bush 's first term , National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice was often at the center of the administration 's most controversial moments .Following the Sept. 11 attacks , national security officials were some of the most scrutinized by media and lawmakers , who wanted to know how the federal government allowed such an attack to happen .Rice 's actions in particular were examined , especially after it was revealed that two months earlier , in July 2001 , CIA Director George Tenet had briefed Rice in an emergency meeting at the White House about the potential threat of an al Qaeda attack .When asked about the meeting in 2006 , Rice claimed that she did not recall the specific meeting and that she had met repeatedly with Tenet that summer about terrorist threats .She insisted it was \" incomprehensible \" that she had ignored terrorist threats two months before 9/11 .In March 2004 , Rice refused to testify before the 9/11 Commission .Under pressure , President Bush agreed to allow Rice to testify , making her the first sitting National Security Advisor to testify on matters of policy .In April 2007 , Rice rejected , on grounds of executive privilege , a House subpoena regarding the false prewar claim that Iraq sought yellowcake uranium from Niger .In 2003 , Rice became one of the most vocal members of the Bush administration as it made its case for going to war against Iraq .After Iraqi officials declared before the United Nations that it had no weapons of mass destruction in December 2002 , Rice wrote an editorial published in The New York Times , \" Why We Know Iraq Is Lying . \"","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.51196"}

{"text":"A character in a pre - industrial society who independently re - invents modern quasi - Randian libertarianism , purely in order to become the author 's mouthpiece for a long rant about the evils of the ( not yet invented ) welfare state , is simply not believable .It 's a sign of incompetence in both storytelling and critical thinking .Jean - yes , quite right .I did n't mean to say you described these narratives as illegitimate .Still , your comment does seem to me to raise that issue , or at least the issue of just what legitimacy they have .And that in turn opens up large and complex questions about the relationship between our life experiences and what we get from literature and art , the relationship , in turn , between art and criticism , and so on .And as some are saying on this thread , when we should be open to the power of narrative and when there is good reason to be suspicious of it and resistant to it .I 'm all for the idea that we should immerse ourselves as far as we can in the canons of great literature , but what about popular narrative forms where the seriousness of the work - its ambition and quality as it engages with life - can vary enormously ?What about the pornography debate : what about commercial pornography ( which , I suppose , has its own varied levels ) as opposed to the varied treatment of sex in ordinary forms of literary or popular narrative , as opposed , perhaps , to great works of erotica ?And so on ... .How do we know when it is appropriate to take a critical , even sceptical or hostile , stance , and when to be open to the experiences offered by literature and art ?Presumably we want the best narratives to be true to human experience in some sense , while also challenging our prejudices in some sense .Does that sound right ?Generally , I think we do develop a capacity to navigate all this flexibly and effectively , and we are capable of having rich conversations about texts , narratives , and art works .But it 's still fascinating to try to sort it all out at a theoretical level .And as always the \" we \" in this paragraph may be a fiction .Most educated adults in Western societies develop that capacity to some considerable extent , I hope , but a lot of other people may not .After all , many people will tell you , with no great expression of shame , that they have never read a novel .I think that making a good inference to the best explanation involves putting ourselves in the shoes of someone who holds each position , as far as possible .If we 've already shifted from one position to the other we 've had experience of holding both points of view .If we 've never held the opposing position then it might be difficult to see the question from that viewpoint , especially with the kind of conceptually difficult questions that philosophers tend to deal in .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"76.27793"}

{"text":"As an example , subversives may infiltrate an organization for cultural subversion more so than for control .Civil unrest may be used to provoke the government into a violent response .In order for a group to be successful in subverting a government , the group itself and its ideas must be seen as an acceptable alternative to the status quo .However , groups that work toward subverting a government , in many cases , follow ideas and promote goals that on their surface would not receive the support of the population .Therefore , \" to gain public credibility , attract new supporters , generate revenue , and acquire other resources , groups need to undertake political activities that are entirely separate , or appear separate , from the overtly violent activities of those groups .Sometimes this is achieved by infiltrating political parties , labor unions , community groups , and charitable organizations \" .[21 ] Infiltrating organizations is an important tool because these institutions are already seen as legitimate in the eyes of the people and provide a platform to express their ideas .When infiltrating , the dissident identifies needs of the organization and then links those needs to solutions that his ideology can provide .This was a technique that the Communist Party USA employed .Once the organization has been co - opted , the dissident can then move on to establishing ties with other groups .[ 22 ] Furthermore , in addition to gaining possible legitimacy for its ideas the infiltration of these groups can , \" bolster political allies , attack government policies , and attract international support \" .[ 23 ] If some organizations are too difficult to infiltrate , it may be necessary to create new organizations that appear to be independent but are actually under the direction of the subversive group .The infiltration of state organizations can provide subversive groups the opportunity to do many things to achieve their goals .The infiltration of security forces can provide information about the government 's capabilities and how they plan to address the group 's activities .Infiltration also provides the opportunity to plant false information , lead the government to misallocate resources , to steal funds , weapons , equipment , and other resources , and ultimately aid in weakening and delegitimizing the government .[ 24 ] The targets of infiltration are not limited to the groups and institutions mentioned above .Economic industries and universities have also been the target for infiltration .In the case of universities , the liberal arts departments are more prone to subversion than the hard sciences .[ 25 ] For precautionary measures one could possibly assume that any group , organization , or institution that may help sway the opinion and beliefs of the citizenry against the government could be a target for infiltration .Economics can be both a tool of the internal and external subversive .For the external subversive simply cutting off credit can cause severe economic problems for a country .An example of this is the United States ' relations with Chile in the early 1970s .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"76.71624"}

Lawrence described Syria 's political - geographic microclimate as he planned the final stages of the Arab revolt : .Nature had ... divided the country into zones .Men , elaborating nature , had given to her compartments an additional complexity .Each of [ the ] main north - and- south strip divisions was crossed and walled off artificially into communities at odds .We had to gather them into our hands for offensive action against the Turks .Feisal 's opportunities and difficulties lay in these political complications of Syria which we mentally arranged in order , like a social map .In a political - geographic microclimate like those in Lebanon , Somalia , or Kurdistan , understanding is elusive .Shifting patterns of family , tribal , religious , economic , and military relations overlaid on specific geography produce a complex , dynamic , and uncertain analytic environment -- one likely to make intelligence analysts cautious and policymakers and commanders uncomfortable and vulnerable .Cultural and Physical Aspects .Cultural geography also needs to be understood in the micro sense .The geography of small areas becomes important in a tribal context .Who are the tribesmen ?Where are they ?","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"77.53792"}

{"text":"Finally , Brecher ( 1993 : 164 ) discovered that crises with violent triggering events , and target responses of equal or higher severity , had a much greater chance of resulting in serious clashes or war .This finding serves as an additional reminder of the importance of limiting and preferably preventing violence in ethnic conflicts .It also makes clear that the level of violence in an ethnic conflict will depend on a group 's beliefs about its environment and the willingness of opponents to suffer escalation costs .Ethnic conflict is a dynamic process in which at least five stages of escalation can clearly be identified .Ethnic conflicts can last months , years or decades The most salient are protracted conflicts , fluctuating in intensity over the course of several decades and involving entire communities .These include the Arab - Israel conflict , the Kashmir dispute , the conflict over Cyprus and Sri Lanka .The key issue for analysts is to learn how to detect ripe moments , turning points and conflict escalation in order for policymakers to stem , prevent , mitigate and channel , conflictual behaviour before it becomes violent .The implication is that identifying patterns of interaction can be used to understand how and when the conditions of escalation and de - escalation occur .If one party can be sought to reduce its conflictual behaviour it is possible that the other side will reciprocate .International efforts can be employed as leverage in order to induce a \" hurting stalemate \" or to influence the behaviour of one of the participants .From an analytical perspective , the most recent evidence indicates that ethnic violence is in modest decline .According to the Minorities at Risk Project between 1945 and 1980 there was gradual increase in ethnic rebellion and non - violent protest .Levels of rebellion reached their peak point by the early 1990s .Projections indicate that between 1996 and the year 2000 ethnic strife will decline even further .In addition , the bulk of the violence today occurs within states not between them .For example , since 1980 there have been few interstate wars and even fewer interstate wars that are primarily ethnic in character - Armenia and Azerbaijan , Iran and Iraq and Yugoslavia are important exceptions .However between 1945 and 1988 there were in excess of 200 interstate ethnic crises involving secession , irredenta or some combination of both .These include the Arab - Israeli Wars , Cyprus , Kashmir and the wars between Ethiopia and Somalia .Another structural indicator related to demography is whether or not the economy is efficient or redistributive .Ethnic groups seeking resources have two options .First , they can pursue national policies that increase aggregate social wealth through methods that are labelled efficient ( i.e. , attempt to improve the condition of almost all of the groups within a society ) .Second , an economic system dominated by a single ethnic group can be expected to produce group - specific benefits or \" rents \" that typically distort the economy through redistribution ( i.e. , seek to improve the conditions of one group in society at the expense of another ) .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"82.635056"}

{"text":"Table 3 is a summary comparison of these foci .This introduction will suffice for the present purpose .In the following sections I shall attend to IW 's criticality , its novelty , the approach best suited to addressing it , and the relevance of cybernetics - particularly second - order cybernetics - in understanding this emergent phenomenon .Cause for Concern : The Prospective Ubiquity of IW in Human Affairs .The presence of the word ' warfare ' leads many to consider IW a topic of purely or primarily military significance .This is not so .In military parlance ' warfare ' is not necessarily synonymous with all - out ' war ' .A critical distinction between the two is drawn in some military literature ( e.g. , Szafranski , 1995 ) .Warfare can be construed generally as any set of activities through which one pursues objectives affording advantage over another ( e.g. , a competitor or adversary ) .In this broad sense , warfare may be constrained in scope , conducted as an ordinary or surreptitious activity , and prosecuted without lethal means .In contrast , war is construed as the unlimited , explicit pursuit of warfare through any and all means ( including the lethal ) .As such , the allusion to IW as ' warfare ' illustrates some important connotations .First , IW can be pursued by all types of organizations and even individuals .Second , IW can be conducted outside the scope of overt conflicts , typically framed with respect to political issues , we associate with military operations .Finally , competitive information - oriented actions reasonably qualifying as information warfare may be conducted in the course of everyday activities such as business .As a result , information warfare is not relegated to the military alone .As a result , the scope of IW effects is disturbingly global .Data and communications services are clearly ' converging ' toward an integrated medium .This opens up the prospect of manipulating all manner of communications services via actions conducted in the one or few digital venue(s ) within which they intersect .This affords force magnification in terms of the ability to impact diverse media / channels in a manner previously requiring numerous actions against multiple targets .This force magnification coincides with ever more widespread access to the tools and techniques for digital mischief .Industrial Age warfare , characterized by scale , required a level of investment reserved to national entities .This scale - dependent cost profile is essentially nullified in cyberspace .The most damaging recent attacks ( e.g. , the 2000 Love Bug virus ) were launched by individuals operating with single computers .Mandatory IW investments are further reduced by the fact that enabling software and procedural knowledge can be obtained freely on the Internet .The capacity for warfare in cyberspace is therefore accessible , affordable , and feasible in a way conventional physical warfare is not .As a result , IW is an option for parties who could not afford to pursue their objectives through traditional physical means .This in turn means the range of parties constituting potential threats is vastly expanded .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"82.854095"}
{"text":"Military .Further Reading .Chapter 4 Intelligence .GENERAL .The successful conduct of counterinsurgency operations relies on the willing support and cooperation of the populations directly involved .Greater priority and awareness is needed to understand the motivations of the parties involved in the conflict and the population as a whole .The understanding of the background and development of the conflict into which US forces are intervening is of particular significance .This requires a detailed understanding of the cultural environment and the human terrain in which the US forces will be operating and thereby places a heavy reliance on the use of HUMINT .The commander requires intelligence about the enemy and the AO prior to engaging in operations .Intelligence assists commanders in visualizing their battlespace , knowing the enemy , organizing their forces , and controlling operations to achieve the desired tactical objectives or end state .Intelligence supports force protection by alerting the commander to emerging threats and assisting in security operations .Intelligence to support counterinsurgency operations focuses on three areas : .Factors motivating the insurgency .Appeal the insurgency holds for insurgents .Organization , leadership , and key functionaries of the insurgency .\" Open - source intelligence \" refers to the practice of drawing information from the news media and processing it into intelligence .It is an increasingly common practice among world intelligence organizations .The six categories of media and news sources providing opensource intelligence are-- .Newspapers .Periodicals .Military and other professional journals .Internet web logs ( commonly called \" blogs .\" Visual media ( primarily television ) .Radio .Units engaged in counterinsurgency operations may face multiple threats .The commander must understand how enemies organize , equip , train , employ , and control their forces .Intelligence provides an understanding of the enemy , which assists in planning , preparing , and executing operations .Commanders must also understand their operational environment and its effects on both their own and enemy operations .The commander receives mission - oriented intelligence on enemy forces and the AO from the G-2/S-2 .The G-2/S-2 depends upon the intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( ISR ) effort to collect and provide information on the enemy and AO .One of the most significant contributions that intelligence can accomplish is to accurately predict future enemy events .Although a difficult task , predictive intelligence enables the commander and staff to anticipate key enemy events or actions and develop corresponding plans or counteractions .The most important purpose of intelligence is to enable decision making .Commanders receive the intelligence , understand it ( because it is tailored to the commander 's requirements ) , and act on it .Through this doctrinal concept , intelligence drives operations .The AO during counterinsurgency operations includes three primary components : physical terrain and weather , society ( socio - cultural , often referred to as the human terrain ) , and infrastructure .These components provide a structure for intelligence personnel to focus and organize to provide support to counterinsurgency operations .These entities are interdependent , not separate .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"82.85983"}

{"text":"As anticipated , both attributes and processes appear on the list of relevant factors .Thus the escalation of ethnic conflict can not be traced to any single factor ; it is a product of pre - existing conditions that combine with actions by groups and states to produce violence .To assess the strength of each of these variables in explaining outcomes an analytical approach would require the development of fairly complex models .Such models are oriented towards assessing both the likelihood that specific events are likely to occur and in the identification of specific factors and their interactions that feed into creating such events .For analysts trying to make sense of the range and phases of ethnic conflict , a good beginning is the creation of profiles of specific conflicts and the types of events under scrutiny .Not only are there significant differences in type there are also differences in levels of aggregation as well .For example , there are low- intensity clashes between groups within states such as in Sri Lanka , there are ethnically - based intrastate wars such as the Ethiopia - Somalia conflict and there are spillover conflicts involving refugee flows into neighbouring states as occurred during the Rwanda crisis .On occasion there is overlap , interactions and multiplier effects so that all three ( or more ) levels are manifest in one conflict . such as in the former Yugoslavia .Benchmark profiles of each type of conflict could provide the empirical basis for testing the validity of more broadly defined theoretical frameworks .Profiles also provide an important base point for determining how new cases should be classified .Ultimately any measurement of success in risk assessment depends heavily on the ability of case - study and country specific information to be combined with statistically - based forecasting techniques .Another way to place these results in context is to draw parallels with crisis escalation in general .Are the conditions associated with ethnic conflict consistent with the factors that facilitate the violent escalation of international crises ?To answer that question , it is appropriate to review the findings of the most comprehensive study available , namely , the research conducted by the International Crisis Behavior ( ICB )Project on 70 years of data ( 1918 - 1988 ) .Obvious parallels emerge between findings from the ICB Project and the list of factors identified in this chapter .Brecher ( 1993 : 164 ) discovered that violence occurred much more frequently within dyads composed of authoritarian regimes .This result is consistent with quite a few items from the above - noted list ; ethnic conflict is more likely to become violent when a single ethnic group emerges as dominant , controls the military , disregards minority rights , and elites become coercive .Brecher 's ( 1993 : 164 ) discovery that crisis escalation to violence becomes more likely with geographic proximity parallels conditions seven and eight from the current list , which focus on affective motivation , ethnic cleavage , demonstration effects , and minority struggles in neighbouring states .Item nine parallels two of Brecher 's ( 1993 : 164 ) findings : Crises are more likely to escalate to violence when ( a ) three or more actors are involved and ( b ) they take place within a protracted conflict .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"83.710175"}

Keller : .The Liberals and J. Edgar Hoover .Lawrenceville , N.J. : 1989 , Princeton University Press , pp .157 - 158 .In this theory , communists are thought to have developed a method of control using surrogates , both witting and unwitting , to actually hold the titular reins of power .While this may appear overly simplistic and paranoid , one need only read the literature of the counter - subversion empire to see the many variations on the theme .Orbis , West Watch , and Information Digest , all have detailed elaborations and fine tunings of these overall views .According to Keller , the conservatives and reactionaries effectively control counter - subversion activities in the U.S. due to the unwillingness on the part of Congressional liberals to actively pursue an oversight role over all counter - intelligence activity .Keller sees this unwillingness stemming from liberal ambivalence regarding the questionable security techniques employed , and their ultimate allegiance to the perceived security needs of the state .In both spheres , the liberal polity demonstrates its stateness .While courts have consistently ruled that passive monitoring of First Amendment activity is permissible , critics charge that passive monitoring and dossier - compiling often turns into disruption or attack , sometimes inadvertently , sometimes intentionally .As Donner explains : .Why wait for the future showdown ?What can be done to get at these people now ?This tension found an outlet in special programs directed at ' key figures ' and ' top functionaries , ' singled out for close penetrative and continuous surveillance .Please read our Terms and Conditions for copyright information regarding downloading , copying , printing , and linking material on this site ; our disclaimer about links present on this website ; and our privacy policy .Syria : the life cycle of civil war .A comprehensive understanding of how , why and when opposition groups in civil war engage in civilian governance must have important policy implications for outsiders engaging or toying with engaging in Syria .In the two years since the Syrian ' Arab Spring ' the international community has paid lip service to the Syrian predicament .Syria 's stasis .From its inception , the life of Syria 's crisis since the uprising is characteristic of civil wars , defined as an internal war within state borders , often with the participation of external actors .Syria 's Arab Spring began with a challenge to the incumbent regime 's monopoly of violence and power .Syrian citizens protested , challenging the status quo , to create change from within .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"84.39267"}

{"text":"The USAF will also have to change how it tracks and understands its airmen 's capabilities - choosing to value air advisory skills enough to track them and manage the career development of select airmen to make them available for these roles .As the USAF revises its Air Expeditionary Force , it will have to make certain changes to its incentive structures - removing the systemic disincentives from forming long - lasting relationships with foreign military members and the overly strict rules for permissive temporary duty and creating new incentives .Such new incentives might involve establishing a compensation system for unique skill sets ( such as flying and maintaining light aircraft ) that are necessary to assist developing air forces , and perhaps , creating a web - based \" market \" that allows us to match individual interests to needs .Lastly , it will mean a decision to create planning tools that allow the USAF to understand and plan effects against influence networks in the same way it can plan kinetic effects against industrial webs .If the U.S. Air Force is willing to institutionalize the necessary mindset and incentive structures , it will provide the nation with a difficult - to - beat foreign policy tool .Rather than distract from the new defense priorities , an effort to institutionalize irregular warfare capabilities into the Air Force supports it .In an age of fiscal austerity , airpower can be a powerful tool to advance U.S. foreign policy , enhancing legitimacy of the U.S. as a security partner and empowering our partners to provide security to their own populations .An air force so configured is just what the nation requires to prevail in the contest for influence and access in Asia - Pacific .The views expressed are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the U.S. military .TODAY 'S FOCUS .What is it ?The National Defense Strategy describes Irregular challenges as challenges coming from those employing \" unconventional \" methods to counter traditional advantages of stronger opponents .As the Army maintains its capabilities and capacity to defeat our adversaries in conventional warfare , our superiority in traditional warfighting has driven our adversaries to avoid direct military confrontation and pursue asymmetric approaches to achieve their strategic objectives .The 2006 QDR directs the Army to retain its superior conventional warfare capabilities and anticipates an increase in adversarial use of irregular challenges as part of the \" Long War . \"Therefore , we are analyzing and implementing initiatives to improve the Army 's ability to prevail against irregular challenges .What has the Army done ?-The Army Strategic Planning Guidance 2005 directed establishment of an irregular challenges Focus Area ( TRADOC , AWC ) .-The Director of the Army Staff released for action the \" Task Force Irregular Challenges Tasking Directive .\" -The Army led the Integrated Ground Based Capabilities Study during the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review which focused on IW implications for general purpose forces .What efforts does the Army plan to continue in the future ?The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report , Strategic Planning Guidance for 2008 - 2013 and IW Roadmap will influence Army thinking in the development of solutions . -","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"84.71562"}

{"text":"When properly coordinated , these offensive operations can have a devastating disruptive effect on an adversary 's combat capability .However , if the resistance initiates its efforts too early , they will alert enemy forces and possibly initiate retaliation .If the resistance initiates its efforts too late , they may not have the required effect to be of value .In a limited - war scenario , this phase still consists of a campaign of guerrilla warfare and subversion , but forces execute them in a slightly different manner .Combat operations generally do not focus around a single culminating D - Day event .Forces conduct these operations over a protracted period of time , with the intent of slowly eroding enemy strength and morale .Guerrilla attacks and acts of sabotage and subversion drain the hostile power 's morale and resources , disrupt its administration , and maintain the civilian population 's morale and will to resist .By repeatedly attacking multiple and widely dispersed targets , the resistance organization confuses , frustrates , and demoralizes hostile forces .Such attacks force the hostile power to divide its reaction and reinforcement capabilities .This slowly creates an increasing demand on the enemy to spend a disproportionate amount of strength to maintain its existing state of control over the population .In either a general - war or limited - war scenario , advisors ensure that resistance activities continue to support the objectives of the U.S. unified commander , mindful that resistance objectives are rarely identical to those of the United States .Some planners assume the goal is to enable resistance forces to transform and equate to additional conventional infantry units .It is the responsibility of the SF HQ to ensure that campaign planners understand the capabilities and limitations of the resistance forces , as well as the associated advantages and disadvantages . ...USE OF ENEMY UNIFORMS .The Hague Conventions of 1907 prohibit the improper use of the enemy 's uniform , such as wearing the enemy 's uniform while engaged in combat .It permits some use of the enemy 's uniform , but it is difficult for personnel to discern the proper use .Although wearing the uniform while engaged in actual combat is unlawful , U.S. forces may wear it to allow movement into and through the enemy 's territory .U.S. policy states that Soldiers may use the enemy 's uniform for infiltration behind enemy lines .However , Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions prohibits this and other uses of the enemy 's uniform .An enemy nation party to Additional Protocol I may consider the use of its uniform by U.S. forces as a war crime .USE OF CIVILIAN ATTIRE .Use of civilian attire by U.S. forces in any military operation is a sensitive matter that can only be undertaken IAW all relevant regulations and policies .U.S. forces should closely coordinate with their legal advisor in the use of nonstandard uniforms or civilian clothing in any military operation .Many of the principles regarding the use of enemy uniforms apply to the use of civilian attire in military operations as well .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"87.1889"}

{"text":"The public - opinion data on this point , unfortunately , is unambiguous ...To be sure , voters do still put jobs and the economy ahead of the deficit in a head - to - head contest of their leading concerns .However , such poll questions assume a choice -- reduce the deficit or improve the economy -- which voters do not actually perceive .Instead , the public believes deficit reduction is an important step for growing the economy .Of course , it 's possible that voters believe cutting the deficit is the most effective route to job growth , an argument Republicans have repeatedly made .If that is the case , many of those who prioritize jobs and the economy ( on opinion polls ) could , in a policy sense , be demanding that politicians take action on deficit reduction .In this scenario , politicians would be responding to an implicit sentiment among voters , .But this also happens to fail the empirical test .Whatever else the public may believe about deficit reduction , they clearly do n't see it as a tonic for jobs .How can these ambivalent results be resolved ?Differences in question wording certainly play a role - questions about \" helping the job situation \" are quite different from questions that directly pit deficit reduction against spending for infrastructure and new technology .But , even when one takes this into account , there is also no question that a very strong \" anti - Keynesian \" perspective on job creation is extraordinarily widespread among American voters .Even the Pew data that Teixeira cites shows most Americans saying that cutting the deficit would either help to create jobs or have no effect at all .The jobs issue in practice : the case of the stimulus .We can get closer to an understanding of what voters actually think by focusing on the most specific and politically salient real - world case of \" job creation \" -- the 2009 stimulus package .Although there was strong majority support for the stimulus during the genuinely frightening moments of early 2009 when the economy was in free - fall , over the following months Republicans gradually chipped away at that support until they hammered it down to a minority position .In February 2009 , a CNN / Opinion Research poll showed a majority of 60 percent favored the economic stimulus bill .In January 2010 , only a minority of 42 percent favored it .They accomplished this by successfully arguing the seemingly absurd proposition that \" The stimulus did n't work - it did n't really create any jobs . \"As Molyneaux notes : . the federal stimulus , is widely considered to have failed .Only one - third of 2010 voters ( 32 percent ) felt the stimulus had helped the economy , while two - thirds felt it had made no difference ( 31 percent ) or had actually hurt ( 34 percent ) .Saying Obama should talk about \" the economy \" elides the huge strategic obstacle posed by the perceived failure of the stimulus .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"87.23671"}

{"text":"As such , narratives can ground our argument , pinpoint manifestations of racism , and renew our commitments .We also acknowledge that confessional narratives can be important indirect arguments against claims of ( dis)trust as well as toward establishing alliance or solidarity .Recognizing these different functions is important , but the discourse that emerges within confessionals can limit the possibility of where the originary moment might lead .Confessional accounts can trap us between narratives of victims / saviors and of villains / heroes .The confessional can lock us into the moment of countering outright denials or reluctant dismissals to claims of injustice ( e.g. , that racism does n't still exist today , or that it exists outside of the self ) .Our own confessional accounts began to trap us into a stasis of fact : in affirming the presence of racism through countering denials of its existence .The classical rhetorical stases are invention / interpretive tools , pinpointing crucial questions that inform , constitute , and probably constrain our anti - racism discourse .These personal histories provided us only with a starting point when exploring together our commitments to racial justice and how we make these commitments actionable .We also realized that our accounts are bound to be local and individual , and so separately they deflated the political dimensions of all encounters with oppression .We see value in the adage \" the personal is political , \" but the value also comes from showing the seamless and seamed connections between these domains .The personal is not just loosely situated in a bigger political scene where power is , on the one hand , ( ab)used to maintain inequities and privilege and , on the other hand , minimally contested and optimally re - configured and subverted .Rather , personal experiences of racism and interventions for anti - racism also find their meaning in systems and institutions ( including academic ones ) that define and distribute power both in explicit and implicit ways .Such power is , in turn , affirmed in epistemological landscapes and networks of access and resources .In other words , our individual action originates from and acts with or against systems of oppression and empowerment .While the work of composing , sharing , and circulating narratives is indeed crucial , there is nothing inherent in these narratives that leads narrators and interlocutors from narration to transformation , from conjecture to policy making , from problem - posing to solidarity - building .Confessional narratives must complement personal commitments with a move toward more systemic understanding of and action against oppression .Only then may we better recognize the political and find ways to intervene and work with / against systems of power .Transformation , policy - making , and coalition - building are processes that are commitment - driven , demanding long - term investment and frequent renewal .A Case in Point : Narrative in Writing Center Literature .Much writing center literature discussing race and racism appears invested in the confessional narrative - in descriptive storytelling about racism observed in the center .Often , writing center literature posits tutors and directors as white , American , and native speakers of English and then recounts a story where the inability to recognize the systemic nature of racism leads to a tutor or writer of color ending their relationship with their writing center .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"87.392715"}

{"text":"Why are some multi - ethnic states susceptible to violent escalation , state breakdown and collapse while others are not ?Current perspectives on violent ethnic conflict and its underlying causes are surveyed in an attempt to answer that question .The focus will be twofold : First , we assess the various attributes of states at risk of ethnic violence .Second , we examine the domestic and international interactions that lead to violence between ethnic groups .We are concerned in particular with states at risk of violence during internal political transformation .For example , power transitions , coups and changes in civil - military relations are generally believed to increase the propensity of a state to engage in both risky foreign and domestic policies .With respect to processes , the emphasis is on how interactions between ethnic groups influence this risky behavior ( Weingast 1995 ; Hardin 1995 ; Gurr 1994 ) .Through an assessment of attributes and dynamic processes we intend to demonstrate that collective action leading to violence depends very strongly on the course of interaction as well as general attributes .We also argue that ethnic conflict refers to the form the conflict takes , not to its causes . 1 To say that ethnic conflict arises because there are distinct ethnic groups is , at best , tautological .By themselves , ethnic differences are insufficient to guarantee political mobilisation , or intergroup conflict .Arguments that emphasize the singularity of specific factors should be avoided .The proper analysis of ethnic conflict calls for a careful assessment of root sources in addition to proximate causes .Since , ethnic conflicts are dynamic and multifaceted phenomena .The analysis of ethnic conflict should focus on the development of models based on theories of multiple causation .This investigation consists of five sections .In section one we assess basic structural determinants of violence .The second section examines interactions between ethnic groups as a source of violent behavior .Third , we evaluate the role of international factors .Fourth , and finally , the conclusion reviews the factors that contribute most significantly to the violent escalation of ethnic conflict .By themselves , politically defined ethnic interests are insufficient explanations for the onset of violence .Indeed most conflicts are only superficially ethnic and are stimulated by a combination of non - ethnic factors .Only after these characteristics have been carefully assessed and balanced can it be determined why some states manage political transitions while others do not .In most cases it is usually the minority and not the majority that initiate political changes leading to confrontational tactics despite the best intentions of political moderates .The primary problem is that deeply divided multi - ethnic states are inherently unstable .There are compelling theoretical reasons for this state of affairs .If a less powerful group is to agree voluntarily ( and democratic institutions are in essence voluntary agreements ) to endure a dominant group 's rules , its interests also must be assured , including safeguards that the more powerful group can not exploit it .Indeed , it is the minority , wary of the interests of the majority , that ultimately determines the viability of any agreement between majority and minority .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"87.62448"}

{"text":"IW as Tactical Languaging .The most illuminating insight afforded us by second - order cybernetics is the realization that information warfare is ultimately a matter of tactical languaging .The allusion to languaging derives from that term 's usage by Maturana ( 1978 ) to denote reciprocal coupling among organisms in a consensual domain .Although to an observer such coupling may be described as ' communicative ' , the intertwined behavioral trajectories of the consensually coupled interactors are determined by their respective structures .This view negates the conventional characterization of language as a symbolic toolkit for literally transferring meaningful ' content ' between interactors .Instead , it is seen as a venue for action -- a coupling among interactors within a ' ... domain of descriptions [ which serves ] as a metadomain that exists only in a consensual domain in reference to another domain . '( Maturana , 1978 , p. 48 ) Maturana reinterprets language as the archetypal illustration of a human consensual domain , and he labels all such interactional domains as ' linguistic ' .This permits him ( 1975 ; 1978 ) to subsume types of ' communication ' other than those exhibiting the finite lexical , syntactical , and semantic elements representative of symbolic systems .This also provides a conceptual base for addressing a broad range of structurally - determined interactors , including the behavioral coupling typical of human - machine interactions ( Whitaker , 1993 ) .The relationship between information warfare and languaging can be illustrated by tracing a series of points from languaging to military theory and back again .The complex of humans and machines constituting an adversarial enterprise ( military or otherwise ) can be addressed in terms of languaging and linguistic behaviors enacted within consensual domains circumscribed by the affordances of the mediating information technologies .Adversarial engagement between two such enterprises can be reinterpreted as reciprocal coupling in which each party attempts to achieve the inverse of Heinz von Foerster 's Ethical Imperative \" Act always so as to increase the number of choices . \"( Foerster , 1981a ) .This is pursued by manipulating the other 's situated domain of interactions so as to restrict the viable choices for his / her subsequent action to those which contribute or lead to a decisive outcome judged positive for oneself .In other words , consensuality is leveraged toward the imposition of control .To be fair , one may ask if this invocation of ' control ' implies that it is first- , and not second - order , cybernetics that is most relevant to this perspective .To the extent that in the end state the ' winning ' system of systems can be construed as ' controlling ' the other , such an implication is understandable .However , this is outweighed by the fact that in information warfare tactical manipulations leading to such an end state are framed with respect to exploiting adversaries as observing systems - i.e. , systems exhibiting capacity for epistemological as well as functional operations .Observing systems not only ' do ' , but they ' know ' as well .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"87.73779"}

{"text":"This is the basis for my claim that IW is best construed as tactical languaging .IW as the Most Essentially ' Human ' War Form .The most unsettling insight afforded us by second - order cybernetics is the realization that information warfare is the most ' essentially human ' war form .This should not be taken as a claim that IW is an essentially ' humane ' war form .As the global community continues to rely ever more on information technologies , it will become increasingly possible to wreak woe and chaos in cyberspace on a scale previously reserved for weapons of mass destruction in the physical space .The ubiquity of access to IW tools and methods suggests that an increasing number of potential aggressors will proceed unconstrained by the mechanisms of checks and balances currently pertaining within and among nation states .To be humane is to be not just biologically human but also ' human in the best sense ' - i.e. , accepting and mindful of others ' legitimacy in the sense to which Maturana applies the label ' love ' .This latter aspect of being humane is neither guaranteed , necessarily promoted , nor evident to date in humans ' usage of cyberspace .Instead , when I claim IW is ' essentially human ' , I mean it is the war form which most intrinsically entails , involves , and exploits the feature distinguishing human beings from other organisms in terms of their identity and their praxis of living .This feature is the very languaging whose linkage to IW was discussed in the last section .Maturana states \" ... human beings happen in language , and we happen in language as the kind of living systems we are . \"( 1988a , p. 43 ) Language circumscribes our being human , because \" all that there is in the human domain are descriptions in the happening of living in language which , as happenings of living in language , become objects of descriptions in language . \"( Maturana , 1988b , section 9 .v. )It is by making distinctions in language that each of us can operate as an observer - \" ... in general , any being operating in language , or , in particular , any human being , in the understanding that language defines humanity . \"( Maturana , 1988b , section 6 .i. )We as humans are observers , and it is on the basis of our being observers that we are definitively human .Because IW is all about manipulating this definitively human capacity , it must be construed as the war form most intrinsic to our being human .Conclusion .The emergent war form therefore confronts us with two troubling prospects .The first is all - out ' war ' being waged in a manner which cuts to the core of ' being human ' .The second is continuous ' warfare ' waged against and through our praxis of conversation .Unfortunately , there is no basis for believing we can contain or inhibit either of these prospects to even the limited extent we 've done so with conventional warfare .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"89.59765"}

{"text":"If there is a lag in the development of those political institutions that safeguard minority rights , behind social and economic change then it becomes clear why minorities have reason to be concerned .For example , a convergence of interests among Croatian , Slovenian and Serb leaders resembled a balance of power system , characterized by a shifting pattern of flexible coalitions .Eventually this balancing broke down , moderates were discredited and Yugoslavia moved from an equilibrium based on decentralized constitutional arrangements to a state in which coercion became the main instrument of control .The Yugoslavia case demonstrates how exogenous shocks , such as imperatives for rapid economic and political change , can create exploitative opportunities .A variety of perspectives identify a constellation of factors that account for the causal relationship between state breakdown and the resurgence of ethnic conflict in regions that were once though to be immune to such problems .For example , structural arguments contend that extreme violence is likely under conditions of power parity .For example , when the size and number of groups within states are relatively equal , as in Yugoslavia , conflict becomes more likely .Diverse , plural states encounter special problems in maintaining strong institutional capacity .These states have divided political loyalties and are less likely to develop civic cultures conducive to the pursuit of peaceful policies for the reduction and management of ethnic conflict .Similarly , if a minority is large in size and territorially concentrated , as in the case of Russians in the Ukraine , it not only constitutes a greater threat at the outset but also possesses better resources for its defense .While the state may be hostile toward the minority , its capacity for coercion is reduced .Others contest that power disparity will lead to violence .This argument suggests that it is easier to mobilize an entire population when there are fewer opponents and few structural factors that limit violent strategies .For example , an ethnic minority that is small in size but geographically concentrated , like the Russians in the Baltic states , may predispose these states toward coercive policies .2 Stability can be defined as a particular set of relationships in which all components are evolving but with the rates of change between ethnic groups and institutions slower than those in other components .In contrast , rapid social and economic mobilization leads to violence and instability .When social mobilization and political participation are high , but institutions are incomplete , the capacity for the state to manage the demands made upon it are diminished .Such regimes will lack the political capacity to carry out reforms peacefully and turn to coercive means to bring about economic and political change .When the state becomes the principal instrument for advancing ethnic group interests , violence becomes more likely .In this case , ethnic identities are evoked in certain structural circumstances to advance the material and political interests of actors whose primary purposes are not ethnic .Subsequent myth - making and dredging up of past events become symbols around which ethnic groups coalesce .These symbols make inter - ethnic violence appear just , honourable and legitimate .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.375885"}

{"text":"[ 24 ] The targets of infiltration are not limited to the groups and institutions mentioned above .Economic industries and universities have also been the target for infiltration .In the case of universities , the liberal arts departments are more prone to subversion than the hard sciences .[ 25 ] For precautionary measures one could possibly assume that any group , organization , or institution that may help sway the opinion and beliefs of the citizenry against the government could be a target for infiltration .Economics can be both a tool of the internal and external subversive .For the external subversive simply cutting off credit can cause severe economic problems for a country .An example of this is the United States ' relations with Chile in the early 1970s .In an attempt to get Salvador Allende removed from office , the United States tried to weaken the Chilean economy .Chile received little foreign investments and the loss of credit prevented Chile from purchasing vital imports .[26 ] An economic pressure of this kind prevents an economy from functioning and reduces a country 's standard of living .If the reduction is too great , the people may become willing to support a change in the government 's leadership .The main objective of economic pressures is to make it difficult for the country to fulfill its basic obligations to the citizenry either by cutting off trade or by depriving it of resources .The internal subversive can also use economics to put pressure on the government through use of the strike .An example of this is the Chilean Truckers ' Strike during the 1970s .The strike prevented the transport of food staples and forced nearly 50 % of the national economy to cease production .[ 27 ] Activities of these kinds create human , economic , and political problems that , if not addressed , can challenge the competency of the government .As defined by Laurence Beilenson , agitation is \" subversive propaganda by action such as mass demonstrations or the political strike , that is , a strike not intended to benefit the union or workers in the ordinary sense , but intended instead against the government \" .[28 ] Furthermore , propaganda and agitation , even when they are legal forms of freedom of speech , press , and assembly can still be classified as subversive activity .These tools further demonstrate the need to determine intent of those taking action to identify subversive activities .Civil unrest creates many of the problems that an insurgency campaign does .First of all it is an affront to government authority , and if the government is unable to quell the unrest it leads to an erosion of state power .This loss of power stems from the people 's lack of trust in the government to maintain law and order .In turn , the people begin to question whether or not new leadership is needed .Discrediting , disarming , and demoralizing the government is the goal of these activities and the cause of the government 's loss of power .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"90.45924"}

{"text":"As documented by Morgenthau ( 1957 ) and many others , the state emerges in crisis whether induced internally or externally .Tilly ( 1978 ) suggests that successful use of coercion by a state in order to suppress local , ethnically - based challenges will encourage more of the same .Hence coercion against minority ethnic groups also is a normative factor : elites become habituated to the use of violence .Violence becomes part of the elite political culture that is assimilated into the national identity .In states with little or no experience in managing ethnic tensions and weak institutional constraints , hegemonial exchange ( and its more coercive variant , the control model ) usually emerges ( Lustick 1979 ; Rothchild and Chazan 1988 ) .Hegemonial exchange is a statist response intended to manage the overt aspects of intergroup ethnic conflict .Elites bargain for the distribution of resources and control the population through patron - client relations .Even when present , electoral politics are not that influential with regard to elite behavior .Control approaches arise as the result of a military coup .During periods of political upheaval , soldiers will have difficulty in putting ethnic affiliations aside .The inability of newly elected governments to manage internal ethnic tensions becomes a prime reason for the armed forces to support ethnic leaders who promise to address their concerns .If the military is pulled into civilian affairs , the ethnic base of a regime will narrow progressively until one or two groups dominate the rest .If the military comes to power it can acquire civilian trappings and seek to build up an affiliated national political party .Former army leaders then become divorced from the command structure within the military , giving rise to conflict over policies between the military and the politicians .Eventually the boundaries between the military and socio - political spheres become fragmented ( Horowitz 1985 ) .These events occur most often in multi - ethnic societies that exhibit porous civil - military boundaries .Africa and Asia are notable in this regard .However , not all coups will lead to institutionalized military control .According to Johnson , Slater and McGowan ( 1984 ) , among 45 majority - rule states in Africa , 25 experienced coup d'etat between 1960 and 1982 .Since independence , military coups have occurred in nearly half of Africa 's states -- 56 attempted coups and 102 reported coup attempts in these states .So why has the military intervened this often ?Most interpretations focus on the military as a corporate entity in which ethnic cleavages play an important role ( Nordlinger 1978 ; Enloe 1980 ; Jenkins and Kposowa 1992 ) .In Africa , ethnic plurality and political competition account for the bulk of military - led ethnic violence .The propensity for military interference within Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania is due to two factors : ( a ) differences in ethnic composition , which were less salient in Tanzania than in Uganda or Kenya ; and ( b ) fragmentation of power and weak institutions .Uganda has the weakest institutions and the most severe ethnic tensions and consequently the greatest degree of military interference .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"91.24193"}

{"text":"All four counterterrorism models fit into one or several of Galula 's COIN strategies for a Cold Insurgency .Activities that fall within the Defensive and Criminal - Justice models can be considered ' reinforcement of the state political machine ' as both bolster institutional legitimacy and security .The War model describes ' direct action against insurgent leadership , ' as might the Criminal - Justice model , depending on the action .Intelligence operations against terrorists , under either the War or Criminal - Justice models , constitute ' infiltration . 'Conclusion .The question ' What is the difference between counter - insurgency and counter - terrorism ' may be interpreted as suggesting that the two are dichotomous , but as a closer look demonstrates , they are in fact closely linked .Terrorism , as an ideological strategy of psychological warfare by political violence , falls under the aegis of insurgency , which is a situation of violent political activism directed against a government by a rebellious minority .Counter - terrorism falls within four models : defensive , reconciliatory , criminal - justice , and war .Those models in turn fit into the broader categories of COIN identified by David Galula in his seminal book on the subject .The difference between counter - terrorism and counter - insurgency is simple : counter - terrorism focuses more narrowly on combating the tactics and strategy of terrorism and those who employ it , while counter - insurgency is a broader category of responses to political violence carried out by minority groups , both terroristic and otherwise .The latter subsumes the former .I believe that the world should deal with counter - insurgency as focal point because the insurgency breeds terrorism .In Pakistan the state still deal Balochistan issue under the insurgency pattern .Nevertheless , the insurgency in Balochistan has been an old phenomenon and the province is facing an escalating terrorism today .It is very obvious that terrorism is dealt with the use of force ; however an excessive use of force can create more problems and may result in escalation of terrorism .But , the insurgency factor needs to be more focused .Military force against any form of insurgency can result into the terrorism ; therefore it is significant to establish a strong link with the insurgence groups in order to come by the side of the table for talks .Right through the history of the world , we have witnessed many wars around us which have always been finished over the talks .If the end of any war is the talks , then it is principally vital to give the \" talks \" not just one chance but many .Because this is the ultimate .Subversion .Subversion refers to an attempt to transform the established social order and its structures of power , authority , and hierarchy .Subversion ( Latin subvertere : overthrow ) refers to a process by which the values and principles of a system in place are contradicted or reversed .More specifically , subversion can be described as an attack on the public morale and , \" the will to resist intervention are the products of combined political and social or class loyalties which are usually attached to national symbols .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"91.70346"}

{"text":"Irregular warfare ( IW ) is a commonly misunderstood and misused term that relates to the violent struggle among state and non - state actors for popular legitimacy , influence and control .It often takes the form of insurgency or terrorism , but does not necessarily manifest itself as such in all cases .For example , stability operations conducted in the aftermath of an interstate armed conflict are a form of irregular warfare , since they necessarily involve the promotion of government control and the likely use of armed force to confront challenges to that control .[ 1 ] .Irregular warfare favors indirect and asymmetric warfare approaches , though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities , in order to erode the adversary 's power , influence , and will .It is inherently a protracted struggle that will test the resolve of a state and its strategic partners .[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Concepts associated with irregular warfare are older than the term itself .[ 7 ] [ 8 ] .One of the earliest known uses of the term irregular warfare is in the 1986 English edition of \" Modern Irregular Warfare in Defense Policy and as a Military Phenomenon \" by Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte .The original 1972 German edition of the book is titled \" Der Moderne Kleinkrieg als Wehrpolitisches und Militarisches Phänomen \" .The German word \" Kleinkrieg \" is literally translated as \" Small War \" .[ 9 ] The word \" Irregular \" , used in the title of the English translation of the book , seems to be a reference non \" regular armed forces \" as per the aforementioned Third Geneva Convention .IW is a form of warfare that has as its objective the credibility and/or legitimacy of the relevant political authority with the goal of undermining or supporting that authority .IW favors indirect approaches , though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities to seek asymmetric approaches , in order to erode an adversary 's power , influence , and will .[ 25 ] .IW is defined as a violent struggle among state and non - state actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant population ( s ) .IW involves conflicts in which enemy combatants are not regular military forces of nation - states .[26 ] .IW is \" war among the people \" as opposed to \" industrial war \" ( i.e. regular war ) .[ 27 ] .^ There is some contention over whether the ARW is properly categorized as an irregular warfare conflict .It acted upon this understanding by publishing propaganda , raising militias from the local population , and developing shadow governments .In this regard , the ARW was a traditional insurgency , aided through an unconventional warfare campaign by France .However , as with many successful insurgencies , the conflict evolved to a point at which the American insurgent forces could directly confront the British conventional forces instead of relying on indirect and asymmetric approaches .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.84997"}

Col . Oliver North , who functioned as the point person in the White House for the covert operation .President George H. W. Bush brought his own foreign policy experience to his leadership of the National Security Council , having served previously as the ambassador to the United Nations and the Director of Central Intelligence .Bush reorganized the NSC to include a Principals Committee , Deputies Committee , and eight Policy Coordinating Committees .The NSC played key roles during such major developments as the collapse of the Soviet Union , the unification of Germany , the invasion of Panama and the Gulf War .The Clinton administration continued to emphasize a collegial approach within the NSC on national security matters .Under President George W. Bush , the NSC - led by Condoleezza Rice until 2005-played key roles in the Global War on Terrorism campaign .This included the effort to round up intelligence that was used to justify the US invasion of Iraq in 2003-intel that ultimately proved inaccurate in regards to Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction .The NSC also underwent structural changes during the Bush administration , including the addition of a \" war czar \" who reports directly to the President ( see Controversies ) .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.95712"}

'They regard India as ' only threat to Pakistan ' and that India is collaborating with the US and Afghanistan to harm Pakistan interest .This analysis shows that Pakistan is considering India and the US as its enemy and is trying to harm their interests by militant activities .Therefore , it has become important for the US to come up with the strategy against militants in Pakistan .Links between ISI and Militant groups in Pakistan : Effecting the US interests .The US policy has been failed to control terrorism in Pakistan tribal areas or terrorist activities sponsored by Pakistan .This has been reflected by recent Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) report , published in New York Times on 30 July 2008 .According to this report , the Director of Inter - Service Intelligence ( ISI ) of Pakistan has links with militant group led by Maulavi Jalaluddin Haqqani .ISI , a government agency service , is an important part of Pakistan army and has been described as ' state within state . 'CAI reported that Maulvi Jalauddin Haqquani has close links with Al Queada .ISI and Maulvi Jalauddia were possibly involved in bomb attacks on Indian embassy in Afghanistan which killed 58 people and two senior Indian diplomats .The report also mentioned that these allegations were based on communications between Pakistan intelligence officers and militants who carried out attacks on Indian embassy in Afghanistan .However , President Musharraf has denied these charges and described ISI as ' the first defense line of Pakistan . 'The relationship between ISI and militants is not new .The first major involvement of ISI in terrorist activities came into light after Soviet Union invasion in Afghanistan in1979 .ISI have provided weapons , money , intelligence and training activities to mujhadeen for fighting against the Red Army .India has also mentioned repeatedly about relationship between ISI and terrorism , but it was never taken seriously .It is only now , when the interest of the US is affected in Afghanistan , it has said that it could take strong action against Pakistan if there are any other terrorist attacks in any part of the world having Pakistan connections .No doubt , the US has now taken it seriously because Pakistan terrorist activities could give a serious blow to its interests .Although Pakistan official policy supports stability and peace in its neighboring country , Afghanistan , its unofficial policy is to support terrorist activities so as to appease political forces within Pakistan .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"93.21266"}

{"text":"But LTC John Nagl of the US Army points out that if that is true , then the \" pool and Olympic record \" is about 12 years .20 Northern Ireland took somewhat longer .21 As an institution , the USAF has not historically demonstrated a strong willingness to see combat issues in 12-year cycles .Acknowledging the distinctions between conventional warfare and COIN becomes especially important for Airmen as they assess how to contribute in COIN interventions .In these circumstances , the key - the first - strategic decision calls for determining whether to fight COIN or to enable COIN .More bluntly , the choice becomes whether to force an existing conventional military template onto a set of largely incompatible circumstances or to build up a partner nation 's capacity to win on its own merit .In strong consensus , speakers and symposium participants warned that no history supports the idea that outside powers win internal wars .Thus , we should choose to enable .As counterintuitive as it may seem at first , this reconceptualization of how to frame airpower 's contribution is fundamental to actually winning in the long view .Hence , the USAF operates most effectively at the strategic level when engaged in support of COIN rather than directly waging it .Ideally , it can do so with and through the supported government and its institutions before the fighting actually begins .These USAF shaping and deterrence actions involve assess , organize , train , equip , assist , and advise initiatives within the context of other political , informational , economic , sociocultural , and military efforts - ultimately designed to establish and/or sustain a legitimate central government .Well planned , these actions also undermine the support structure and rationale for dissent and/or rebellion .These activities are essential to conflict avoidance or at least mitigation of antigovernment complaints and recruiting .An oft - repeated but subjective assertion regarding the optimal mix of actions states that one spends only about 20 percent of a successful COIN effort on military initiatives ; the remaining 80 percent comes from the economic , political , and sociocultural contributions to the overall strategy .Information remains the lifeblood of every effort .The USAF 's general-­purpose forces should have the ability to create what would have been their own effort from the resources of the host nation .If , in some cases , they should build from the ground up , they will need to draw upon a broad set of talents from throughout the full range of USAF specialties .To enable similar efforts by the supported air force , we should replicate the processes , disciplines , and inventories ( people and things ) that enable USAF efforts ( appropriate to circumstance and culture ) .Using an enable strategy produces the immediate benefit of significantly reducing the profile of Americans in a contested nation .As seen recently in Iraq , and repeatedly in history , large - power footprints can become a significant rallying factor for traditionally disparate , antigovernment groups .Even groups that would never work together in normal circumstances have joined efforts to eject the outsiders .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"93.45335"}
{"text":"Yet they do hold more objective meaning as well , though the difference between the two can sometimes be confusing .Both counter - terrorism and counter - insurgency have often been used to describe similar state activities , but they are not interchangeable .A nuanced examination of what each term actually means shows that while closely related , they are nevertheless analytically discrete .The particular ways in which counter - terrorism and counter - insurgency are different , and also how they are related , become evident in a discussion of the phenomena of terrorism and insurgency themselves , and then what it means for a state to ' counter ' them .Terrorism and Counter - Terrorism .Any discussion of the concepts of ' counter - terrorism ' and ' counter - insurgency ' would be meaningless without first defining what terrorism and insurgency actually are .Yet this is easier said than done , especially with regard to the former .Academics have struggled to define terrorism for decades , reaching no significant consensus .Some academics have provided definitions that span dense paragraphs referencing over a dozen traits , [ 1 ] while others offer a minimalist definition of only a few words .[ 2 ] However , the majority view of most academics seems to be that terrorism is ' a politically motivated tactic involving the threat or use of force or violence in which the pursuit of publicity plays a significant role . '[ 3 ] For this short essay , I will use this definition .Furthermore , as the term ' counter - terrorism ' implies actions taken by governments , I will focus on non - state actors as the primary agents of terrorism , as they are the relevant terrorists in this discussion .As a strategic choice , terrorism follows a three - stage method : disorientation , target response , and gaining legitimacy : [ 4 ] .Disorientation seeks to sow within a population a general sense of insecurity and detract from the legitimacy of existing state structures , often through random acts of violence that prey upon the civilian population in general .[5 ] .Target response seeks to prompt a disproportionately harsh collective reprisal from a government , in order to radicalise the affected population and win international legitimacy , or to wrestle political concessions .[ 6 ] .Gaining legiti macy is where the terrorist group seeks to transfer legitimacy from the government to its own cause through skilful manipulation of the media , through grassroots social agitation , or through alternative media such as the internet .At this stage , ideology becomes crucial .[ 7 ] .Counter - terrorism consists of actions or strategies aimed at preventing terrorism from escalating , controlling the damage from terrorist attacks that do occur , and ultimately seeking to eradicate terrorism in a given context .Counter - terrorism can be classified according to four theoretical models : Defensive , Reconciliatory , Criminal - Justice , and War .Generally speaking , each model contains differences in threat perception , how to guard against that threat , how to frame terrorism in the law and constitution , and which agents effect counter - terrorism .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"93.531235"}
{"text":"But nativists were isolationist , and thought every attempt to involve the United States in global politics was part of an internationalist plot , even attempts to involve the country in fighting global communism .Still , there was agreement among the three main political tendencies that the spread of communism had to be stopped if their unique ( often contradictory ) vision of Western civilization was to survive .A seminal work in shaping the Cold War was William R. Kintner 's 1950 book \" The Front is Everywhere \" in which Kintner lays out his analysis of the communist style of subversion through a \" Communist Fifth Column \" involved in otherwise legal \" political activity . \" Emphasis in the original .According to Kintner , since the ultimate goal of communist subversion is armed revolution and the destruction of the democratic state , it is a national security necessity to ferret out the presence of communists in organizations involved in non - criminal political activity .Are additional laws needed ? . . .Isthe American judicial system flexible enough to convict the professional revolutionaries of a quasi - military party , whose mode of operation is designed to make convictions on the accepted rules of evidence next to impossible ?Because of the very nature of the Communist party , the government may have to fall back on such proof .The best way to stop these malicious attacks is to distinquish accurately between loyal American liberals and radicals and those professional revolutionaries who take their orders from Moscow .The National Lawyers Guild .One group that came under attack as a front group during the 1950 's was the National Lawyers Guild ( NLG ) .Red baiting of the NLG began soon after the organization was established in 1937 , but for several years the public mood was such that the charges never gained wide circulation or prompted any concern .Articles in the \" New York Times \" from the period show a dramatic change in the situation during the late 1940 's .Up until 1948 , articles on the NLG cited in the \" Times \" index center on substantive activities and positions of the NLG on law and legislation .Starting in 1948 , however , the Times coverage of the NLG through the next ten years centers on charges relating to subversion .Much of the \" documentation \" on the NLG as a communist front can be traced to Congressional hearings held during the McCarthy Period .This labelling was part of a coordinated campaign involving the Congressional committees , the FBI and right - wing groups .The FBI passed the information to Richard Nixon , then a congressman on the House Un - American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) , and pursuaded him to hold a press conference announcing a HUAC probe of the NLG as a communist front .According to Krinsky , a partner in the law firm Rabinowitz , Boudin , Standard , Krinsky , Lieberman , the FBI then publicly launched an investigation of the NLG and privately fed inflammatory information to right - wing and anti - communist contacts .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"93.62563"}

{"text":"Such qualifications are essential to disentangling the complexities of the systems of systems that modern military praxis emphasizes .For the sake of illustration , let us apply Maturana and Varela 's key construct of ' domain ' to clarify what constitutes an enterprise involved in IW .This gives us a view of enterprises as composite unities comprised of intertwined and interoperating technical and human components operating within distinguishable domains of operation ( cf .Maturana and Varela , 1980 ) .Adversarial enterprises can then be usefully treated as composite unities comprised of composite unities whose summary behaviors are the observable outcomes of events and processes manifested in these distinct domains .A simplified sketch of such multi - domain interdependence is offered in Figure 1 .Figure 1 is a derivative variant on the venue framework introduced by Whitaker ( 1992 ) in analyzing meetings .It employs domain - specific differentiation and contextualization , inspired by the work of Maturana and Varela , to clarify the dimensions within which IW is pursued .In this case , five specific domains of reference are invoked .The physical domain subsumes the tangible components of the adversarial system of systems ( e.g. , hardware ) .The data domain is the referential context for addressing specific states of the physically - realized media ( e.g. , signals , bytes ) .Each human participant has an associated cognitive domain ( as that term is used by Maturana and Varela ) .In the course of reciprocally coupling with each other , these humans effect a consensual domain of interactions within which their languaging occurs ( cf .Maturana , 1978 ) .Finally , these participants ' consensual domain may be a component of a larger such consensual domain of interactions spanning their team , enterprise , culture , and/or society .Such a broader domain of interactions is simply labeled a ' social domain ' for present purposes .Insofar as a given dyad of human interactors may be construed as participating in multiple supra - dyad networks or contexts of interactivity , it is commonly constructive to approach enterprises in terms of multiple such social domains emerging from interactivity manifested in the other domains .Figure 1 can be employed to illustrate the division between the techno - centric and cogno - centric regions of the composite enterprise .The physical and data domains are subsumed within the techno - centric vantage .The cognitive and consensual domains are subsumed within the cogno - centric vantage .The intersection between the two is typically discernible at the point where the ( techno - centric ) ' vehicles ' for interpersonal engagement are involved with the ( cogno - centric ) ' content ' of that interactivity .It is with respect to this juncture that the military criticality of information technologies is most commonly framed .It has been noted that first- and second - order cybernetics and the techno- and cogno - centric vantages , respectively , are correlated in terms of the former 's applicability to the latter .Using Figure 1 this correlation can now be employed to identify the general domains of operations , and hence classes of enterprise phenomena , to which the tools of first- and second - order cybernetics are relatively better suited .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"94.58358"}

{"text":"These pictures do however illustrate the tendency evident in most ( if not all ) separated multiple narrative structures , which is to have some form of framing device for the stories .A popular device has always been the concept of the hotel with many rooms , each of which harbors its own miniature narrative .This device has been used since Grand Hotel ( 1932 ) through California Suite ( 1978 ) up to and including Four Rooms ( 1996 ) .The fact that the four stories in the latter example were directed by four different people is indicative of the absence of unity of meaning .These pictures are best approached as short story collections in which the framing device is the binding that holds them together as one picture .Within this framing device , the narratives then appear consecutively .They encourage the viewer to construct separate fabulas for the various narratives rather than construct meaning on another level from the parallelism evident in the stories .When a picture 's multiple narrative structure is less rigid , the process of fabula construction becomes more complex .And as soon as formal cues explicitly encourage the viewer to connect the causally separated narratives to infer meaning from their co - existence within a single framework , the picture can be said to utilize an integrated multiple narrative structure .Integrated double narrative structures .In the case of the integrated multiple narrative structure , two or more narratives exist alongside each other without exerting any great narrative power over each other or eventually combining into a unified narrative .The viewer is then encouraged through the use of specific cues to draw meaning from parallels and contrasts between the different narratives .Examples of this kind of picture include and The French Lieutenant 's Woman , Short Cuts and Parenthood .This parallelism is a key concept for all forms of integrated multiple narrative cinema .A viewer expects a film to adhere to some kind of unity .In the case of a multiple narrative structure , the viewer 's intuitive search for unity drives him inevitably towards a comparison of the events and characters from the two narratives .Classical structures often seem to follow two separate narrative paths that are in fact always causally unified .In Desperately Seeking Susan for instance , the plot follows two protagonists separately without having them meet each other until the end of the picture .The entire plot is built around the farcical construction of the two main characters continuously missing each other , which leads to the complications that make up the plot .Woody Allen 's Crimes and Misdemeanors ( 1989 ) has a structure that might appear similar when glanced at superficially : two protagonists with little in common are both followed separately until they meet in the last sequence of the film .Why then , does Crimes and Misdemeanors qualify as a double narrative picture , since the two protagonists likewise do not meet each other until the last scene of the film ?The difference lies in the fact that in the case of Crimes and Misdemeanors , there is no narrative event that combines the characters .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"94.78256"}

{"text":"Political warfare is the use of political means to compel an opponent to do one 's will , based on hostile intent .The term political describes the calculated interaction between a government and a target audience to include another state 's government , military , and/or general population .Governments use a variety of techniques to coerce certain actions , thereby gaining relative advantage over an opponent .The techniques include propaganda and psychological operations ( PSYOP ) , which service national and military objectives respectively .Propaganda has many aspects and a hostile and coercive political purpose .Psychological operations are for strategic and tactical military objectives and may be intended for hostile military and civilian populations .[ 1 ] .Political warfare 's coercive nature leads to weakening or destroying an opponent 's political , social , or societal will , and forcing a course of action favorable to a state 's interest .Political war may be combined with violence , economic pressure , subversion , and diplomacy , but its chief aspect is \" the use of words , images and ideas .\"[ 2 ] The creation , deployment , and continuation of these coercive methods are a function of statecraft for nations and serve as a potential substitute for more direct military action .[ 3 ] For instance , methods like economic sanctions or embargoes are intended to inflict the necessary economic damage to force political change .The utilized methods and techniques in political war depend on the state 's political vision and composition .Conduct will differ according to whether the state is totalitarian , authoritative , or democratic .[ 4 ] .The ultimate goal of political warfare is to alter an opponent 's opinions and actions in favour of one state 's interests without utilizing military power .This type of organized persuasion or coercion also has the practical purpose of saving lives through eschewing the use of violence in order to further political goals .Thus , political warfare also involves \" the art of heartening friends and disheartening enemies , of gaining help for one 's cause and causing the abandonment of the enemies ' .\" [ 5 ] Generally , political warfare is distinguished by its hostile intent and through potential escalation ; but the loss of life is an accepted consequence .Political warfare utilizes all instruments short of war available to a nation to achieve its national objectives .The best tool of political warfare is \" effective policy forcefully explained \" , [ 6 ] or more directly , \" overt policy forcefully backed .\" [ 8 ] The major way political warfare is waged is through propaganda .The essence of these operations can be either overt or covert . \" White \" or overt propaganda comes from a known source .\" Gray \" propaganda , on the other hand , is the \" semiofficial amplification of a government 's voice .\" [ 9 ] Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are examples of \" gray \" propaganda during the Cold War . \"Black \" propaganda , however , is propaganda which originates from an unknown source .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"95.0181"}

{"text":"Once these two elements have been exhausted , the character is logically the first one to be killed off .His death , like Malone 's , strengthens both Ness 's resolve and audience support .Nicci carries out every single unforgivable act in the film , and is therefore executed by the hero in the film 's finale .These are characters that play off each other well .Like television 's The A - Team , they are a male group in which each member has his own expertise , his own plot function and his own personality element to add to the group .Not every Hollywood film has a cast of characters as overtly schematic as The Untouchables .But genres like the action picture that usually adhere strictly to genre conventions are good examples for the principles that guide most of American cinema .The Untouchables is so thoroughly made up of genre elements that it verges on pastiche .Just like Miller 's Crossing ( 1990 ) , it chooses not to play with these conventions to confound the viewer , but to deliver the familiar elements with enough style and reverence to make it an entertaining homage to the action movie 's past .Unlike Pulp Fiction , which deliberately plays with genre conventions and audience expectations , The Untouchables flaunts the narrative clichés of the genre , making it a good example of contemporary formula - bound filmmaking .The viewer uses these structural narrative conventions to make sense of a picture , and since he is used to have a picture make sense according to these rules , he expects a film to follow them closely .For instance , when the character of Malone is elaborately introduced in the above example , the viewer expects this character not to vanish completely after this scene ( which would have been a more likely thing to happen in real life ) .Neither does the viewer expect the narrative to start delving into a completely separate story , following Malone into his personal life while cutting back and forth between this narrative and that of Elliot Ness .Another way in which a filmmaker can decide to move against audience expectations is by not presenting the characters within the framework of a unified narrative .A different route The Untouchables might have taken might have been by having Malone and Ness meet on the bridge as they do in an early part of the film , and instead of pairing them up to fight Capone together , intercut their narratives with one another .Their stories would co - exist within the film without exerting causal influence over each other , encouraging the viewer to construct meaning based on the various parallels and similarities between the characters ' stories .Had director Brian de Palma and screenwriter David Mamet chosen to travel this less conventional route , the result would have been a simple multiple narrative structure .Fabula and syuzhet in multiple narrative structures .A broad definition of multiple narrative cinema would therefore be the existence of more than one causal sequence of events ( which constitutes a narrative ) within the framework of a single picture , without one governing narrative event to tie them together .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.36163"}
{"text":"The ethnographic understanding of ambivalent voters has four important practical implications for Democratic strategy : .The traditional message basically represents \" preaching to the converted \" -- it only resonates with the already - convinced Democratic base .Repetition of the narrative has no effect on partisan adherents of the opposite view and ambivalent voters require reasonable answers aimed at overcoming their doubts and objections to Democratic proposals and not simply repetitions of the basic message .In the long run the deep distrust of government that exists today must be reduced before strong public support can be won for aggressive job creation efforts by government ( for proposals in this regard , see the previous TDS Strategy Memo here ) .Attempts to persuade them that the Democratic view is completely right and the Republican view completely wrong are unlikely to be effective because such attempts run against the grain of their mode of thinking .The most effective strategy will be to present facts that weaken the plausibility of the conservative view and to argue that the Dem position is actually closer to a common sense middle ground than the more extreme Republican view .In the early post - World War II period there was actually a broad national consensus in favor of \" full employment \" i.e. measure to prevent unemployment from rising above four percent .Unions represented a major sector of the workforce at that time and were strong supporters , economists argued that they knew how to manage the economy and , most important , the business establishment was also publicly in favor .Under these vastly different circumstances , it is just not plausible to argue that the Dems failure to win majority public support for creating jobs is simply the result of inadequate Democratic passion and commitment to the goal .Democratic speeches may still recall the glory days of the great \" national consensus \" for full employment , but that consensus is now a fading memory .Conclusion .Building support for significant job creation will require new tactics and the creation of a new political coalition .It will require tackling the deep distrust of government that now exists and pointing out the many areas where the ideologically pure conservative position is simply unrealistic and the need for some government action simply a matter of down - to - earth \" common sense \" .The starting point for this effort , however , must be the recognition that winning majority support can not be based on simply repeating the standard arguments of the past .The fact that the public continues to strongly support \" jobs \" or \" job creation \" on opinion polls does not mean they still support the post - war Keynesian policies that kept unemployment low in the 1950 's and 1960 's .No amount of rhetoric - no matter how passionate or theatrical - can make this reality disappear .TDS Strategy Memo : Why ca n't the Dems make jobs a winning political issue ?It seems like it should be a \" slam dunk \" but it 's not .Here 's why .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.37126"}

{"text":"None of the stories - Benghazi , the IRS , AP subpoenas - points to a tyrannical dictator or a hapless onlooker .To connect three disparate stories of varying degrees of legitimacy and importance into a mega - scandal is lazy .So , too , is the embrace of competing narratives that cancel each other out .Conversion narratives , rational argument , and the life of the mind .One issue raised in the current debate about Joel Marks 's shift ... conversion ... whatever you want to call it ... to moral error theory is the role played in argument and viewpoint - forming by autobiographical narrative .In this post , I 'm not so much concerned about Marks 's new metaethical position , although that substantive issue remains interesting , as in the kind of weight or trust we should accord this sort of narrative .In her post on the Marks piece over at In Living Color , Jean Kazez expresses scepticism : . ...I think the genre is compelling but deceptive .The convert presents himself ( or herself ) as traveling from darkness into light , and the sheer drama makes us think -- yes , yes , yes , that 's the light !The story line of revelation is no substitute for good arguments .In particular it has opened up questions about what some of our underlying commitments may be when we engage in philosophical analysis and argument .For the moment , let 's stick to the role of autobiographical narratives .Jean 's comment expresses a rather austere scepticism about them ... which is a bit of a concern for someone like me who recently co - edited a book of essays that includes quite a large number of such narratives .Some of the essays in 50 Voices of Disbelief are fairly straightforward arguments or position statements , but most are , indeed , autobiographical .My own essay , \" Unbelievable ! \" , falls partly into this genre , even though it does contain some philosophical argument .Needless to say , I have operated here on the basis that such narratives are valuable , and that they do something legitimate that is enabled by their literary form .It 's also true that an argument is only as good as its premises and the sort of deductive or inductive logic it displays .So how can any arguments that are embedded in these autobiographical conversion narratives thereby gain in power ?If they do , surely that power is merely rhetorical - does n't the literary form give an extra psychological force to an argument , without increasing the cogency of the argument itself ?And is n't this somehow intellectually illegitimate ?Good questions .But there 's a worry here .If we answer these questions affirmatively , are we thereby requesting that these narratives no longer be written and published ?Perhaps those of us who actually understand this issue should make a free choice to stop writing conversion narratives , editing them , trying to get them published , and so on ?","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.9476"}

' \" ( J.A. 8) .The government 's evidence supporting the charged conspiracy consisted of David McMasters delivering cocaine and cocaine base to Tracey Rouss , who was charged as a conspirator in the indictment .In their respective briefs , the parties appear to agree that the conspiracy involved cocaine and/or cocaine base and raise no issue regarding a possible variance between the indictment and the evidence .For purposes of clarity , we will refer to the charged conspiracy as one alleging a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"97.81728"}

Smith , 41 F.3d 1565 , 1568 ( D.C.Cir.1994 ) .We have never addressed whether this type error is subject to harmless error analysis .Initially , we note that it would be anomalous to conclude that a district court 's failure to give a defendant 's proposed instruction which substantially impaired his ability to present his defense can be harmless .We need not decide , however , whether the failure to give Lewis ' proposed government - agent instruction is subject to harmless error analysis , because , even applying a harmless error analysis , as the government urges us to do , the error was not harmless .As we discussed in section II.C. , the two principal players in arranging the car - for - cocaine exchange were government agents , and without Lewis ' proposed government - agent instruction , the likelihood the jury convicted Lewis of conspiring with either or both of them was substantially significant .Under these circumstances it strains credulity to conclude the error was harmless , even if a harmless error analysis should be applied .The indictment charges Lewis with conspiracy to \" possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine , also known as ' crack . ' \" ( J.A. 8) .The government 's evidence supporting the charged conspiracy consisted of David McMasters delivering cocaine and cocaine base to Tracey Rouss , who was charged as a conspirator in the indictment .In their respective briefs , the parties appear to agree that the conspiracy involved cocaine and/or cocaine base and raise no issue regarding a possible variance between the indictment and the evidence .For purposes of clarity , we will refer to the charged conspiracy as one alleging a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine .The evidence showed McMasters delivered 55.1 grams of cocaine and 23.7 grams of cocaine base to Rouss , but there was no evidence that Lewis had any negotiations with McMasters regarding a specific amount of cocaine that Lewis would receive in exchange for his car .Of course , as a threshold for applying this test , a defendant must present an adequate evidentiary foundation supporting the instruction .Here , the government does not dispute that Lewis presented a proper evidentiary foundation supporting his instruction , i.e. , that McMasters and Griffith were government agents .12.2(c ) .First , we find no merit in Lewis ' outrageous government conduct ground , because the facts surrounding this ground relate to counts two and three of the indictment , both of which Lewis was acquitted .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"99.40198"}

{"text":"[ 12 ] .Comparing Counter - Terrorism and Counter - Insurgency .There is a clear similarity between the goals of an insurgent and the goals of a terrorist .Both the insurgent and the terrorist employ violent action not as a direct means to compel but as a method of ideological communication .Both the insurgent and the terrorist struggle to gain legitimacy for their ideas in the minds of a target audience , and to detract from the legitimacy of a non - compliant government .Essentially , the difference between insurgency and terrorism is that the former is a situation of political grievance that escalates to violence while the latter is a violent strategy that those with political grievances may employ .Hence terrorism is one strategy available to those engaging in insurgency .Whether terrorism is possible outside a situation of insurgency depends on whether there is a threshold beyond which a minority group engaging in violent activism is sufficiently large to be called insurgent , and below which a group ' merely ' comprises fringe radicals .As terrorism is best understood as a strategy of insurgency , counter - terrorism is thus best understood as a component of counter - insurgency .All four counterterrorism models fit into one or several of Galula 's COIN strategies for a Cold Insurgency .Activities that fall within the Defensive and Criminal - Justice models can be considered ' reinforcement of the state political machine ' as both bolster institutional legitimacy and security .The War model describes ' direct action against insurgent leadership , ' as might the Criminal - Justice model , depending on the action .Intelligence operations against terrorists , under either the War or Criminal - Justice models , constitute ' infiltration . 'Conclusion .The question ' What is the difference between counter - insurgency and counter - terrorism ' may be interpreted as suggesting that the two are dichotomous , but as a closer look demonstrates , they are in fact closely linked .Terrorism , as an ideological strategy of psychological warfare by political violence , falls under the aegis of insurgency , which is a situation of violent political activism directed against a government by a rebellious minority .Counter - terrorism falls within four models : defensive , reconciliatory , criminal - justice , and war .Those models in turn fit into the broader categories of COIN identified by David Galula in his seminal book on the subject .The difference between counter - terrorism and counter - insurgency is simple : counter - terrorism focuses more narrowly on combating the tactics and strategy of terrorism and those who employ it , while counter - insurgency is a broader category of responses to political violence carried out by minority groups , both terroristic and otherwise .The latter subsumes the former .Archives .This content was written by a student and assessed as part of a university degree .E - IR publishes student essays & dissertations to allow our readers to broaden their understanding of what is possible when answering similar questions in their own studies .Counter - terrorism ' and ' counter - insurgency ' as they are popularly understood are rhetorically loaded concepts .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"100.44539"}

McMasters Finally Gets His Due for Exposing Ponzi .For the first time ever , the ACFE presented its annual Cliff Robertson Sentinel Award posthumously .Who was the person who earned such an honor , 43 years after his death ?William H. McMasters , the man who exposed Charles Ponzi as a fraud in 1920 .He was Ponzi 's publicist for just a short time before he realized his client was a fraudster .McMasters then wrote a scathing exposé for The Boston Post that led to Ponzi 's ultimate downfall .The newspaper received the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for its Ponzi coverage .McMasters never even saw the medal and , during his lifetime , he never received public recognition for his role .It is past time to give him his due .BRUSH WITH INFAMY Possibly the most remarkable part of the story is that McMasters wrote the exposé on Ponzi only 10 days after Ponzi hired him .Compare that to the years of reporters ' and investigators ' questions before Bernie Madoff 's scheme finally came crashing down .On July 23 , 1920 , Boston Municipal Court judge Frank Leveroni and William S. McNary , treasurer of the Hanover Trust Company , called McMasters - by then a well - known publicity agent - into Leveroni 's office to meet Ponzi .They wanted to know if McMasters would consider working for Ponzi , who had become a major Hanover Trust stockholder .Ponzi was dashing - he wore an expensive suit and was incredibly charming and confident .He outlined his plan for a massive financial empire .He purportedly sent money overseas to be exchanged for local currency , and then his contacts bought postal coupons and mailed them to Ponzi , who exchanged them for stamps , which businesses bought in bulk for a reduced price .( See sidebar : \" Who was Charles Ponzi , and what was his scheme ? \"below . )The bottom line was he was raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars a month from investors with the promise of a 50-percent return rate on their money within 90 days .McMasters ' suspicions began as early as the very first meeting because the rate of return seemed a little too fantastic , but he was honest about his prospects .\" I was not averse to having a millionaire for a client , especially one who evidently wanted to spend money lavishly , \" McMasters wrote in a 1949 accounting of the story .As his newly hired publicist , McMasters scored Ponzi an interview with The Boston Post ( which then had the largest circulation in New England ) shortly after his first meeting with Ponzi .The front - page story the next day drew investors like flies to honey .A line formed at Ponzi 's office at 6 a.m. , and he collected more than $ 3 million ( US $ 34 million in today 's dollars ) in just one day .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"101.26015"}

{"text":"What matters is to have seen one or more alternatives to the purposes that most people take for granted , and to have chosen among these alternatives - thereby , in some measure , creating yourself .As Harold Bloom has recently reminded us , the point of reading a great many books is to become aware of a great number of alternative purposes , and the point of that is to become an autonomous self .Autonomy , in this un - Kantian and distinctively Bloomian sense , is pretty much the same thing as Heideggerian authenticity .Most human beings , even those who have the requisite money and leisure , are not intellectuals .If they read books it is not because they seek redemption but either because they wish to be entertained or distracted , or because they want to become better able to carry out some antecedent purpose .They do not read books to find out what purposes to have .The intellectuals do .\" I sometimes think of competing worldviews as engaged in a Red Queen race .Each one develops new arguments to try to infect the other , and new defenses to act as an immune system against criticism .While on an individual level we can try to avoid making flawed arguments , in order to be effective you have to be aware of what is out there , and what irrational arguments have been incorporated into each side 's arsenal .I think that it is a legitimate tactic to use a narrative that antagonizes some other , irrational or inaccurate narrative .For example , a positive conversion experience would not be a good argument for an idea by itself .But if the other person already rejects the idea , and that rejection is due to fear of a devastatingly negative conversion experience , than seeing the idea through the eyes of someone who did n't have a bad experience might block out that knee - jerk fearful reaction .The irrational argument from conversion , that an idea is true because people who believe it are happy , is not being made .Very few people are likely to be immediately persuaded that error theory is correct .But the presence of the narrative inhibits the opposing irrational argument , that error theory is wrong because it generates nihilist despair .I do think that conversion stories cross a line , however , when implausible or false stories are presented as being plausible or true .Some popular Christian apologists have two \" versions \" of their conversion stories ( Lee Strobel comes to mind ) .Around atheists , they claim to have been skeptics who calmly examined the evidence for Christianity and were convinced through primarily intellectual realizations .Around Christians , they claim to have been morally adrift and emotionally unstable individuals who , at a particularly difficult time in their lives , called out to God , and were rewarded with a sense of purpose , moral clarity , and/or stability .At least one of these stories must be false or misleading in important ways , and so the honesty of the speaker comes into question .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"101.41339"}

{"text":"For the past year , Carole Martin and I have been co - facilitating a \" network leadership program \" supported by the Neil and Louise Tillotson Fund called the Community Practitioners Network ( CPN ) .The overall goal of CPN is to further develop a .. TDS Strategy Memo : Why ca n't the Dems make jobs a winning political issue ?It seems like it should be a \" slam dunk \" but it 's not .Here 's why .One of the most exasperating Democratic failures of the last two years has been the Dems inability to turn high unemployment into a winning political issue .To many progressive Democrats the failure seems literally incomprehensible .After all , millions of Americans are deeply and painfully affected by job losses and opinion polls show with absolute consistency that voters strongly accord \" creating jobs \" a higher priority than deficit reduction .This holds true across an extraordinarily wide variety of different polls and question wordings .Given these two facts , many progressives conclude that the only plausible explanation for the Dems failure is their timidity and fear of challenging conservative myths with sufficient boldness .It is easy to sympathize with the intense frustration that motivates these views but the reasons why Dems have had less success with the jobs issue than seems warranted are more complex than simply a lack of sufficient passion or commitment .It 's important to understand these deeper causes because they suggest more effective strategies for the future .Why the opinion poll data is less clear - cut than it appears .The key problem that must be recognized is that the apparently unambiguous support opinion polls suggest for creating jobs is actually extremely misleading .While creating jobs is indeed consistently given a higher priority than reducing deficits , how this particular fact fits into the larger pattern of public attitudes is far from obvious .It is in the connection [ of deficit reduction ] to job creation that Democrats misunderstand the tenor of public opinion .Economists , Keynesian and otherwise , along with Democrats , mostly recognize that federal spending creates jobs .Not so voters , at least many of them .Indeed , several polls suggest that voters judge cutting federal spending to be the single most effective step government can take to create jobs .So when Democrats argue that the GOP is focused on spending cuts at the expense of job creation , most Americans shake their heads in disbelief , seeing those cuts as exactly the kind of \" stimulus \" we need .For most progressives , who generally have at least a nodding acquaintance with the basic ideas of John Maynard Keynes , it seems almost impossible to believe that substantial numbers of voters can seriously accept this genuinely wacky notion .It appears simply irrational .But when one listens to enough focus groups and other real - world discussions it becomes clear that this view is indeed incredibly pervasive .People will frequently say that \" Only private business creates \" real \" jobs .Government just takes money away from the private sector and transfers it to government bureaucrats and lazy civil servants \" .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"101.87889"}
{"text":"Since none of the events in this film are causally related , it is impossible to identify the causally unrelated strands that would make it an identifiable multiple narrative structure .Plentiful examples of classical Hollywood filmmaking also exist in which several causally unrelated chains of events co - exist , most notably in science - fiction or disaster movies that deal with global events from diverse perspectives .Examples of this kind of film are Dr. Strangelove , or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb ( 1964 ) , Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( 1978 ) and Deep Impact ( 1998 ) .The syuzhet will typically follow several characters unrelated to each other , who might actually never meet during the course of the film .These films will however usually focus on characters that may be viewed as typical for a certain class , culture or group in society ( examples being government officials , scientists , teenagers , blue - collar working men etc . ) .I would argue that these perspectives are included not to draw meaning from the ways in which they contrast or draw meaning from each other , but because of the need to dramatize a global event from different perspectives .These various perspectives may conflict with each other ( as in Dr. Strangelove ) or they may coincide ( as in Deep Impact ) , depending on the ideology propagated by the film as a whole .I would only include them as exceptions to a rule , not as veritable multiple narrative structures .Semi - multiple narratives .Certain genres of classical picture share certain traits with multiple narrative structures without truly sharing the defining features .The two genres that come close to a multiple narrative structure are those of the ensemble picture and the heist movie .The main structural difference between these two genres is the constitution of the group .In the heist movie , the group is , logically , extremely goal - oriented .Its goal as a group is usually : 1 .the preparation of the robbery ; 2 . execution of the robbery ; 3 . escape and/or double - crossing of accomplices .A classical example is The Asphalt Jungle ( 1950 ) .It begins with the introduction of the various characters who will eventually make up the gang .One of the characters chooses to double - cross the others , which eventually leads to the police catching up with the gang members one by one in the last part of the film .The emphasis is thus put on the complexity of a unified structure , how one person 's act causes a wave of events that spells out the doom of all the other characters involved in the scheme .Since so several characters have influence over the causal development of the plot , the syuzhet will allow shifts in point of view in order to supply the viewer with all the information necessary for fabula construction .This remains however a single fabula .Heat even introduces characters that at first seem to be wholly unconnected to either group of characters or their goals , but in the end they are all shown to be connected as parts of one structure .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"101.91002"}

McMasters , the Boston publicist who , in 1920 , helped take down the most notorious pyramid schemer of them all : Charles Ponzi .For the first time ever , the ACFE presented its annual Cliff Robertson Sentinel Award posthumously .Who was the person who earned such an honor , 43 years after his death ?William H. McMasters , the man who exposed Charles Ponzi as a fraud in 1920 .He was Ponzi 's publicist for just a short time before he realized his client was a fraudster .McMasters then wrote a scathing exposé for The Boston Post that led to Ponzi 's ultimate downfall .The newspaper received the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for its Ponzi coverage .McMasters never even saw the medal and , during his lifetime , he never received public recognition for his role .It is past time to give him his due .BRUSH WITH INFAMY .Possibly the most remarkable part of the story is that McMasters wrote the exposé on Ponzi only 10 days after Ponzi hired him .Compare that to the years of reporters ' and investigators ' questions before Bernie Madoff 's scheme finally came crashing down .On July 23 , 1920 , Boston Municipal Court judge Frank Leveroni and William S. McNary , treasurer of the Hanover Trust Company , called McMasters - by then a well - known publicity agent - into Leveroni 's office to meet Ponzi .They wanted to know if McMasters would consider working for Ponzi , who had become a major Hanover Trust stockholder .Ponzi was dashing - he wore an expensive suit and was incredibly charming and confident .He outlined his plan for a massive financial empire .He purportedly sent money overseas to be exchanged for local currency , and then his contacts bought postal coupons and mailed them to Ponzi , who exchanged them for stamps , which businesses bought in bulk for a reduced price .( See sidebar : \" Who was Charles Ponzi , and what was his scheme ? \"below . )The bottom line was he was raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars a month from investors with the promise of a 50-percent return rate on their money within 90 days .McMasters ' suspicions began as early as the very first meeting because the rate of return seemed a little too fantastic , but he was honest about his prospects .\" I was not averse to having a millionaire for a client , especially one who evidently wanted to spend money lavishly , \" McMasters wrote in a 1949 accounting of the story .As his newly hired publicist , McMasters scored Ponzi an interview with The Boston Post ( which then had the largest circulation in New England ) shortly after his first meeting with Ponzi .The front - page story the next day drew investors like flies to honey .A line formed at Ponzi 's office at 6 a.m. , and he collected more than $ 3 million ( US $ 34 million in today 's dollars ) in just one day .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"102.347336"}
{"text":"Through this path , ethnic displacement , refugee flows and spontaneous population transfers constitute a form of contagion .The spillover of displaced ethnic groups creates changes in demography thereby creating regional instability .For example , the violent outflow of Tutsis and moderate Hutus from Rwanda to Zaire and Burundi in 1994 has created a new class of militant ethnic leaders that Howard Adelman has characterised as \" refugee warriors . \"Second , ethnic conflicts in one country may prompt groups in another to make more extreme demands .This constitutes a demonstration effect .Groups in one state , witnessing ethnic mobilization by ethnic groups in another , may increase their own political activities .The latter recognize that internationalization of their demands can both simultaneously encourage internal mobilization and weaken the saliency and effectiveness of the state by creating international forums for substate grievances .This legitimization process is supported by the existence of supranational organizations and human rights organizations , which provide a forum for subnational ethnic claims .Consider the 25 June 1991 , declarations of independence first by Croatia and then by Slovenia as a demonstration effect that emboldened both states to commit to full separation from the Yugoslav Federation .Third , diffusion occurs through information flows and transnational media networks that condition the behaviour of transnational ethnic coalitions .Information flows directly influence the level of protest and rebellion and the level of ethnic mobilization among ethnic brethren .For example , consider the way in Bosnian Muslims were portrayed by the Serb media in order to undermine the Dayton and Vane - Owen Peace Accords .These peace plans were presented as a threat of Muslim fundamentalists in Bosnia , seeking to perpetrate genocide against Serbs , an argument that pervaded the Belgrade media .Fourth , ethnic diasporas provide material and non - material support for politically mobilized ethnic groups .These affective links are crucial for an ethnic separatist movement to prosper and grow .Two types of linkage are notable .The first are particularist identities between groups that straddle borders .The second linkage is the impact a global diaspora has on the development of ethnic leadership pools in non - neighbouring states .For example , after the Gulf War there was realignment of international interests in South East Asia among the Muslim community .There was a shift away from Saudi Arabia to Iran , as the primary external focal point of support for many Islamic protest groups .Conclusion ( Return to Top ) Based on the analysis of domestic attributes , interactions between groups , and international interactions , the following conditions are associated with the violent escalation of ethnic conflict : . a state is experiencing power transitions and rapid transformations in institutions that weaken its regime ; . a single ethnic group comes to dominate policy - making procedures and institutions and inter - elite accommodation is weak or nonexistent ; .the state provides a differential advantage to a minority group over issues related to distribution of resources ; . political channels for the articulation of minority interests are weak or underdeveloped ; .the military is dominated by a single ethnic group ; . elites maintain institutions specialized in the use of coercion ; . affective motivation and ethnic cleavage are present ; . demonstration effects include the success of insurgencies and minority struggles in neighbouring states ; .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"102.41388"}

{"text":"[ 27 ] Conversely , in 1979 , the Soviet Union was unable to successfully penetrate the Afghan society after supporting a coup which brought a new Marxist government to power .While Soviet units were already in Kabul , Afghanistan at the time of the coup , additional Soviet troops arrived to reinforce the units and seize important provincial cities , bringing the total of Soviet troops inside Afghanistan to 125,000 - 140,000 .The Soviets were unprepared for the Afghan resistance which included classic guerrilla tactics with foreign support .In 1989 , Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan , having been unable to infiltrate the Afghan society or immobilize the resistance .[28 ] .The history of political warfare can be traced to antiquity .[29 ] .There are abundant examples of political warfare in antiquity .In ancient Greece , a famous example is that of the Trojan Horse , which used deception for tactical military objectives .Propaganda was commonly utilized , including Greek rhetoric and theatre which used words and images to influence populations throughout the Hellenic world .This practice has left a lasting legacy of speech as a mechanism of political power , greater than force in solving disputes and inducing submission .[ 30 ] During this same period , Alexander the Great used coinage imprinted with his own image , indirectly forcing conquered nations to accept his legitimacy as national ruler and to unite disparate nations together under his dominion .[ 31 ] .Ancient Rome utilized similar political warfare as the Greeks including rhetoric , as displayed by Cicero ; and art , as seen in coinage , statues , architecture , engineering , and mosaics .All of these elements were intended to portray Rome 's imperial dominance over its subject nations and the superior nature of Roman society .[ 32 ] Following a religious vision , the emperor Constantine I in AD 330 bound the Roman state to the universal Christian Church .In doing so , he linked \" religious commitment with imperial ambition \" that proved to be quite successful and powerful .[33 ] One long - lasting symbol of this is the Chi Ro , which forms the first two letters of the Greeks ' name for Christ .This symbol was used for over one thousand years by Constantine 's successors as a symbol of \" imperial majesty and divine authority \" [ 34 ] and still is a powerful symbol within Christianity .Logo used on aid delivered to European countries during the Marshall Plan .American foreign policy demonstrates a tendency to move towards political warfare in times of tension and perceived threat , and toward public diplomacy in times of improved relations and peace .American use of political warfare depends on its central political vision of the world and its subsequent foreign policy objectives .[ 35 ] After World War II , the threat of Soviet expansion brought two new aims for American political warfare : .To restore Western Europe through military , economic , and political support .President Harry S. Truman established a government political warfare capability in the National Security Act of 1947 .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"103.5854"}

{"text":"The transition from second to third wave is arguably more radical than any prior shift in human social structures and praxis .Historically , everyday praxis has been grounded in the same three - dimensional physical space as our biological embodiment .Based on our experience of physical space , we developed constructs such as ' extent ' and ' proximity ' to ' territorialize ' space and our activities therein .The character of cyberspace effectively negates our traditional territorialization and renders even metaphorically - applied territorial concepts nonsensical .This means long - established military ( and other ) theories of praxis are becoming obsolete .This can be illustrated with respect to the theory of maneuver warfare - the style of mobile surface warfare exemplified by the German blitzkrieg tactics of World War II .Leonhard ( 1994 ) enumerates three essential arrangements ( i.e. , territorializations ) of forces in maneuver warfare : the file , the front , and the ' box ' ( enclosure ) .The file is employed for efficient movement ( e.g. , a truck convoy ) .The front deploys forces for maximum force projection ( e.g. , a line of trenches ) .The ' box ' is any enclosed arrangement typically employed in defense .These arrangements ' merits are predicated on the character of physical space , the finite nature of deployed units , and the finite time required to move these units among locations .In cyberspace , the ability to rapidly replicate and instantaneously ' move ' units negates the affordances and constraints contextualizing these canonical arrangements in the physical space .If form and arrangement of units is insufficient for modeling cyberspace phenomena , what would be a better approach ?Essler and Whitaker ( 2001 ) , after an examination of such problems with specific regard to business and management models , argue that cyberspace enterprises are most constructively approached in terms of interactivity .They introduced the term agitecture to connote a configuration of actions and operations analogous to the configuration of constitutive elements denoted by the ubiquitous term ' infrastructure ' .Such an agitectural perspective , prioritizing dynamic interactivity over static constitution , is similarly the most effective way to approach information warfare .In the remaining sections the implications of this claim for IW research generally and cybernetics in particular will be discussed .First I shall briefly comment on the necessity of a systemic perspective in approaching IW as interactivity and illustrate how second - order cybernetics recommends itself as the field best suited for addressing the phenomenon .Later , I shall briefly discuss the communicative interactivity central to the phenomenon , comment on its relationship to second - order cybernetics ' central themes , and demonstrate how second - order cybernetics illuminates the significance of IW as an essentially human war form .IW in Terms of Systems and Cybernetics .The requisite shift toward a focus on interactivity entails fundamental units of reference addressable in terms of their dynamics .This suggests a systems perspective , which in turn suggests cybernetics as a field suited to the task at hand .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"104.60651"}

{"text":"Formally , Yugoslav socialism was a tight - knit system , with public opinion and ideology strictly controlled by an elite bureaucracy .The absence of confrontations and conflicts between classes prevented , in part , the growth of a liberal emphasis on individual rights and liberties .The convergence of interests among Croatian , Slovenian and Serb leaders resembled a balance of power system , characterized by a shifting pattern of flexible coalitions .Eventually this balancing broke down and Yugoslavia moved from an equilibrium based on decentralized constitutional arrangements to a state in which coercion became the main instrument of control .According to Gurr ( 1994 ) four factors determine whether or not a minority will mobilise against state dominance .The first is the degree of economic , social and political disparities between groups .In general , severely deprived groups have a greater chance of becoming politically active .By itself , though , deprivation is not a sufficient condition for ethnic conflict to ensue .A group must also have a common purpose , leadership and organization .A second factor is the salience of group identity .Cross - cutting identities or low cohesion among ethnic groups is thought to reduce the probability that an ethnic group will be able to act in concert .Motivations for forming ethnic groups may be material , as in mobilization for the defence of interests , or as attempts by the group to either frustrate or promote modernization , for example .Changes experienced at one level , such as dehumanization ( a psychological factor ) , stimulate cohesiveness and eventually increase polarization between groups .Symbols are important group markers in this process of mobilization .Third , organizational skills and regional concentration are also crucial to the development of political activity .Leadership is crucial to the rise and growth of ethnic movements .Increased scales of ethnic organization encourage ethnic mobilisation to the extent that small - scale bases of ethnic organizations are weakened in favour of large scale ethnic affiliations that provide the organizational framework and constituency for ethnic collective action .Finally , ethnic mobilisation must elicit a response from the dominant group or state against which it is reacting .Reciprocity and interactions also are important factors to consider .Conflict between dominant groups and minorities usually involve issues of national identity ; the expansion and centralization of nationalist political authority which creates a competitive arena for state controlled resources ; and the recognition of ethnicity as a basis for resource competition and political access .The foregoing suggests that independence of government from other spheres of state activity will determine the extent to which a state succumbs to ethnic group pressures .In highly developed societies , institutions are arguably better insulated from external influence .Rebellious minorities can be co - opted into the political process and leaders are unlikely to rely on coercion to suppress such challenges .In contrast , a highly repressive regime ( police state ) will discourage any form of rebellion ( Muller and Weede 1990 ) .However , when determining the likelihood of ethnic violence in transitional societies , it also necessary to assess interactions between civilian and military leaders .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"105.61795"}

{"text":"When we look at multiple narrative cinema , the first question we should ask ourselves concerns the nature of a multiple narrative ( or multiple story ) picture .In most cases it is rather easy to see whether a film consists of more than one causal chain of events or not .Since the rest of this paper will deal specifically with the characteristics and hallmarks of multiple narratives structures , I will first go into an example of a typical classical structure .Classical Hollywood cinema has traditionally presented its viewer with a unified narrative .A filmic grammar was developed gradually to help the viewer make sense of the narrative .Elements such as main and supporting characters help the viewer understand what the story is about .In Bordwell 's definition of the classical Hollywood cinema , the narrative is focused on a goal - oriented protagonist : a hero who is drawn into a situation which he must resolve in some way .Since the plot is typically focused solely on the goals of the protagonist , supporting characters are introduced into the plot to fulfill a certain function .These characters may have their own goals , which may or may not become part of the hero 's quest , but they usually have a single specialty or trait that gives them a function in the plot ( romantic interest , sidekick , evil henchman , etc . ) .The Untouchables ( 1987 ) is a perfect example .The film 's narrative deals with Treasury officer Elliot Ness 's quest to get criminal Al Capone behind bars .This is a goal that is clearly and explicitly delineated from the start , and most scenes follow the protagonists 's actions from that point on .At first he tries to achieve this goal by himself , which leads to failure when he finds out that the rest of the police force is corrupt .As he walks home , depressed about his embarrassing failure , the character of Malone ( Sean Connery ) is introduced .In the first dialogue between the two characters , Malone shows himself to be an expert on Chicago in general and police work in particular .Ness therefore looks Malone up the next day and persuades him to join forces and go after Capone .Malone continues to tutor Ness about Capone and police work throughout the rest of the picture , until he delivers the last clue on catching Capone to Ness , at which point he is killed off .The death of Malone not only has the plot function of strengthening Ness 's resolve to catch Capone , it also functions structurally as reinforcement of the audience 's sympathy for his quest .The other key supporting characters have similarly functional plot activities : Stone ( Andy Garcia ) is recruited from the police academy , where he is introduced as an excellent marksman .This quality will serve its purpose in two key sequences , while other character elements are either underplayed or simply not included : the only information on Stone is that he is of Italian descent , he is not married and he is and excellent marksman .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"112.02964"}
{"text":"Russell , It 's a wonderfully interesting question whether these narratives have a legitimate role in persuading , or just deceive .Will think more ... .But I want to clarify - I did n't say these narratives are illegitimate .Tolstoy 's Confession ( which Marks 's narrative really does call to mind ) is a truly beautiful piece of literature .It is the \" hook \" at the beginning of my book on the good life , and I 've used it in a course for many , many years .At the very least , it tells us about Tolstoy , the man , and it 's worthwhile to understand people .But does the narrative provide some sort of argumentation as well , as opposed to just seducing us ?Well , it could be both -- some argumentation , some seduction .So watch out for the seduction !As James points out , ( almost ? )no argument is devoid of the rhetorical persuasion that it is encapsulated in .We would like to think we hook up to the purely rational or deductive or even inductive part of an argument , but that is probably never the case .Understanding some of the more obvious biases that affect us does help for better discourse .As you say , the self - narrative strategy can help us hook up to the intuitions of other people and can help us measure our own intuitions .It is also useful just from an intersubjective and friendly point of view .If we are being pulled by some strong empathetic emotions to believing in the other 's argument just because of that structure alone , that could be bad .Though , essentially many of our core beliefs , and even subsequent beliefs , probably came from some kind of equally dubious method of socialization or education .Lastly , I struggle with how much literature helps me , though I liked your analysis of it and think I hold a fairly similar view .I , after neglecting it previously , have been reading literature pretty heavily over the last two years .I question how much I am gaining of the other perspective , and likewise how much such perspectives help me see the world .I feel like philosophy ( broadly construed ) and science and psychology still is more useful in helping me understand both my own and other 's intuitions and worldviews .That does not mean I am going to stop reading literature , but I may back off to a certain extent to concentrate on other areas- after I get done with Proust , which will admittedly take a while .This is Rorty 's take on searching for a \" redemptive \" and critical analysis of ones self , and how literature and philosophy can help us achieve a better understanding about what to do with our lives .I think it is a good take , even if there are some things that make me scratch my head .Rorty : . . . .\"As Heidegger emphasized , to achieve authenticity in this sense is not necessarily to reject one 's past .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"112.66498"}

{"text":"Typically , the ensemble picture deals with a group of characters that is together in one defined location for a short period of time .In this time , they attempt to solve some of their problems , some of which may be caused by other members of the group .The film usually ends with the characters going their separate ways again , having unambiguously solved their problems or failed to do so .The focus of the picture is typically on the interaction within the group : the characters need each other to solve their problems , and they usually succeed in doing so during the time they spend together .There is usually so much interaction between the characters that we can not really speak of multiple narratives at all , but rather a complex structure in which several more or less goal - oriented protagonists work together to reach narrative closure .A very typical ensemble picture is The Big Chill ( 1983 ) , which deals with a group of college friends who spend a weekend evaluating their lives since college after one member of their former group has committed suicide .During this weekend , they all come to terms with personal problems they face towards themselves or towards others in the group , and most have unequivocally solved the problems by the end of the weekend .Other similar films include The Return of the Secaucus Seven ( 1978 ) , Peter 's Friends ( 1992 ) and Beautiful Girls ( 1996 ) .A different ( and fairly unique ) form of ensemble picture has been pioneered by John Sayles , and might be termed multiple perspective structure .Pictures like Matewan ( 1987 ) and Eight Men Out ( 1988 ) deal with historical events and the way in which they affected various different groups of people .But as in the above examples , their non - hierarchical structure of characters is in some ways very similar to it .Making Commitments to Racial Justice Actionable .Abstract : In this article , we articulate a framework for making our commitments to racial justice actionable , a framework that moves from narrating confessional accounts to articulating our commitments and then acting on them through both self - work and work - with - others , a dialectic possibility we identify and explore .We model a method for moving beyond originary confessional narratives and engage in dialogue with \" the willingness to be disturbed , \" ( Wheatley , 2002 ) believing that disturbances are productive places from which we can more clearly articulate and act from our commitments .Drawing on our own experiences , we engage the political , systemic , and enduring nature of racism as we together chart an educational frame that counters the macro - logics of oppression enacted daily through micro - inequities .As we advocate for additional and ongoing considerations of the work of anti - racism in educational settings , we invite others to embrace , along with us , both the willingness to be disturbed and the attention to making commitments actionable .This article is inspired by conversations we 've had about how our shared commitments to racial justice become manifest and actionable in our everyday lives .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"113.24353"}

{"text":"According to his definitions for film narration , a viewer constructs the fabula ( or story ) based on the way the plot elements are organized in their own specific way within a picture ( syuzhet ) .In theory , one fabula can be presented in an infinite number of ways : Franco Zeffirelli 's 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet for instance tells the same story as Baz Luhrmann 's 1997 film , but they tell their stories in very dissimilar ways .In the case of multiple narrative structures , the question is automatically raised whether a multiple narrative picture viewer constructs multiple fabulas , or a single fabula that encompasses several strands of storytelling .The question of fabula construction will therefore be a key issue in my discussion of the two main forms of multiple narrative cinema : separated multiple narratives and integrated multiple narratives .This broad distinction sets apart pictures in which the syuzhet prompts the viewer via formal cues to interconnect the multiple narratives from multiple narrative structures that do not .It is a distinction that would therefore put a multiple narrative film like New York Stories ( 1991 ) in a different category than for instance Short Cuts ( 1993 ) .The above distinction can not be applied off - hand , for the issues it raises are more complex than first impressions might suggest .For when one starts to examine cases more closely , it becomes apparent that the precise borders between the various varieties can be difficult to define .On one level , separated and integrated multiple narrative films are the same : they have more than one causal chain of events that exist alongside each other and that encourage the viewer to construct more than one fabula .On another level , however , in the case of integrated multiple narratives , I will argue that cues are included within the film 's structure that encourage the viewer to construct meaning from thematic and/or formal parallels between the multiple narratives .Even the most classical narrative structures allow some space for narrative diversions into terrain more typical of multiple narrative cinema , making it difficult to define precisely where multiple narrative structures begin or end .Classical pictures often have multiple protagonists whose narratives may start off separately , only to reveal the way they fit together late in the picture ( as in L.A. Confidential [ 1997 ] ) .It is even harder to draw an absolute line between separated and integrated multiple narrative structures , and though these borders can be found , it takes close examination of particular cases .Separated multiple narratives .Horror compendiums incorporating similar framing devices were popular between 1962 and 1972 and included such titles as Tales of Terror ( 1962 ) , Tales from the Crypt ( 1972 ) and Dr. Terror 's House of Horrors ( 1965 ) .In the latter , the framing device consists of five men traveling in a railway carriage who have their future told by a sixth passenger who turns out to be Death .The five narratives are similar ( the protagonist dies in each one due to macabre and/or supernatural causes ) but wholly separate from each other .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"117.48142"}

{"text":"At or about the same time , Lewis and his wife separated , and Lewis moved out of his home .Lewis then moved in with his friend , Richard Griffith ( Griffith ) , who also worked at the Charlestown Races and was from Barbados .According to a friend of Griffith 's named David McMasters ( McMasters ) , approximately a week to ten days prior to May 15 , 1992 , Griffith informed him that Lewis was interested in exchanging his 1990 Hyundai automobile for cocaine .2 Griffith denied this at trial and testified that all of the initial discussions regarding exchanging Lewis ' car for cocaine occurred directly between McMasters and Lewis .Griffith and McMasters agreed , however , that McMasters allegedly knew some drug dealers in Arizona who were willing to exchange cocaine for Lewis ' car and would pay them a commission of approximately two pounds of marijuana for arranging the exchange .Unbeknownst to either Griffith or Lewis at this time , McMasters was a government informant who was operating undercover as part of a plea agreement .The evidence established that McMasters and Griffith had been confederates in previous drug deals , some of which formed a basis for the charges that caused McMasters to enter into the plea agreement .Approximately one week after the conversation between McMasters and Griffith concerning the exchange of Lewis ' car - for - cocaine , Sergeant Steve Tucker of the West Virginia State Police placed a recording device on McMasters ' telephone .Several conversations between Lewis and McMasters and Griffith and McMasters were taped .All of the tape recordings made by Tucker during the period of May 15 - 20 , 1992 , were introduced during the trial and played for the jury .The tape recordings contained conversations between Griffith and McMasters in which they discussed how Lewis would reinstate the insurance on his Hyundai and photograph it so that he would be able to collect the insurance money on the reported - stolen vehicle .4 McMasters told Griffith that if they obtained the cocaine from the police and set up Lewis in this sting operation , Griffith would be totally exonerated .The tape recordings also revealed Lewis had actually rejected the car - for - cocaine exchange on several occasions .During one conversation on May 17 , 1992 , McMasters told Griffith to tell Lewis that he had to \" get off of his ass and get it done . \"( J.A. 175 ) .Griffith informed McMasters during a conversation on May 19 , 1992 , that Lewis had twice said \" no \" to the car - for - cocaine exchange .( J.A. 246 - 47 ) .During this same conversation , Griffith related that he had admonished Lewis the night before to make up his mind one way or the other .On May 18 , 1992 , Lewis drove to McMasters ' residence to inspect the cocaine .The next day , on May 19 , 1992 , in preparation for the exchange , Lewis delivered his car to the parking lot of the apartment building where McMasters resided .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"126.46233"}

{"text":"In Crimes and Misdemeanors , the two protagonists meet coincidentally at a party , where Landau 's character tells Allen of his experiences .As Chapter Two will illustrate in more detail , the causal chains of events that make up the narratives of the two protagonists are not causally related in the case of Crimes and Misdemeanors .Judah is not a narrative agent within Cliff 's narrative , the links that hold them together within the framework of the film are so tenuous that it is only just likely that they should meet at all as they do at the end of the film .And this scene together , rather than providing the solution for the problems of either one , can be seen as an epilogue in which both characters reflect on the impact the preceding events have had on their respective lives .It is possible for two narratives within an integrated mutilpe narrative structure to be much farther separated than in the preceding example .In The French Lieutenant 's Woman ( 1981 ) , the two narratives both feature characters played by Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep .One narrative follows them as characters in a Victorian romance , the other as actors playing those same characters in the film - within - a - film .The parallels and differences between the two romances point out salient differences in attitudes towards love , sex and romance in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries .In Sliding Doors ( 1998 ) , the character played by Gwyneth Paltrow is followed through two different chains of events simultaneously , one of which starts with her missing a train and the other with her just managing to catch it .The parallels between the narratives draw attention to the degree in which coincidence or character mostly determines the course of a person 's life .And in The Godfather Part II ( 1974 ) , which is examined in detail in Chapter Two , Michael Corleone 's rise to power is contrasted with that of his father half a century earlier .The parallelism inherent in integrated multiple narrative structures is clearest in the above examples of double narrative structures .It is most often also the key to more complex integrated multiple narrative structures .But generally speaking , when a film 's structure includes more than three or four narrative lines , the viewer 's activity will shift from following the individual stories and constructing several fabulas to examining the ways in which the narratives relate to each other .Even when the narratives in a complex multiple narrative structure are relatively distinct and separate , the viewer will most likely construct meaning from the film based on how the many stories co - relate .The final point of this process can be seen in Slacker ( 1991 ) , a fictional narrative film in which the camera tracks along with characters in Austin , Texas that never re - appear once they are out of the frame .This film may be viewed as the most extreme form of multiple narrative structure , though one may wonder whether narrative at this point still exists .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"133.50053"}
