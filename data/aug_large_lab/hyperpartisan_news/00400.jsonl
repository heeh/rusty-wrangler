{"text":"USA Today _ 4/9/08 .Veteran forecaster Bill Read took over the center 's top job Friday in the wake of a staff mutiny and other friction that sparked the ouster of his predecessor , who lasted only six months .Read , 58 , had been serving as deputy director since August , when the turmoil at the center in West Miami - Dade County triggered the departure of then - director Bill Proenza .The dispute led to a congressional hearing and distracted forecasters during the hurricane season , something no one wants to see repeated .Read said he believed the center now can concentrate solely on delivering its forecasts , operating in close concert with emergency managers , the media and the public .Miami Herald / Houston Chronicle _ 1/25/08 .A warming global ocean - influencing the winds that shear off the tops of developing storms - could mean fewer Atlantic hurricanes striking the United States according to new findings by NOAA climate scientists .Furthermore , the relative warming role of the Pacific , Indian and Atlantic oceans is important for determining Atlantic hurricane activity .The article , to be published on January 23 in Geophysical Research Letters , uses observations to show that warming of global sea surface temperatures is associated with a secular , or sustained long - term increase , of vertical wind shear in the main development region for Atlantic hurricanes .The increased vertical wind shear coincides with a downward trend in U.S. landfalling hurricanes .This study also suggests that where the global ocean warming occurs is important for determining the vertical wind shear in the Atlantic hurricane main development region - within the 10 ° -20 ° North latitude belt that stretches from west Africa to Central America .Whether future global warming increases Atlantic hurricane activity will probably depend on the relative role induced by sustained long - term warming over the tropical oceans .Science Daily _1/20/08 .The 2008 hurricane season is likely to be less kind to the United States than the one that ended officially last week , according to forecasters at Colorado State University .For next season , which begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30 , they foresee 13 named storms - those with winds of 39 m.p.h . or better - one fewer than this year .But the forecasters , Philip Klotzbach and William M. Gray , warn of a high likelihood that at least one major hurricane , with winds of 111 m.p.h . or more , will make U.S. landfall , which did not happen this year .The 2007 season left an early holiday present for U.S. taxpayers .Not a single major disaster was declared for a hurricane this year , according to Ashley Small , spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency .By contrast , FEMA has committed $ 37.8 billion to cleaning up hurricane damage from the 2005 season - about $ 350 for every U.S. household .The total for 2006 was $ 2.6 billion .Not that the 2007 season was without drama .For the first time on record , two deadly Category 5 hurricanes , with winds over 160 m.p.h . -","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"58.87274"}

{"text":"David was a huge storm which intensified into a category 5 Hurricane on its approach to the Lesser Antilles .Hoever , it moved south of Puerto Rico and then turned NW directly over Hispaniola as a Cat 5 .Now , hopefully God forbid Irene wo n't become a category 5 hurricane .But , It may take on a path similar to David 's back in 1979 .David 's structure was so impressive in that the land interaction he encountered only marginally weakened him .So , if Irene can continue to get more impressive with a structure being very well stacked and strengthens into a formidable tropical cyclone , then it is very possible she can recover quite quickly after land interaction , similar to David .OK , where is Irene going to go ?The models have shifted East this Morning to the East Coast of Florida with some while some hug the West Coast of Florida .Here is my thoughts to consider .Irene is moving at over 20 mph .This is a strong indication of how strong this ridge of high pressure is currently .Irene must slow down to move in a different direction .A player that should be considered is Invest 98L which breaks the ridge down some but , in doing so will pump a ridge to its west very fast with very warm air spinning around .Depending upon the strength of 98L will depend upon how strong the ridge that will control Irene .I currently do n't really have much of an idea except that the entire state of Florida and now i would have to put Georgia and South Carolina into the mix as the models have moved to the East overnite .Caution tho , as models shift back and forth this far out vey often .Can a tropical weather entity really ' push or jog ' a high pressure system ?I 've never heard of that ? ? ?Quoting TampaSpin : Just too let everyone know but , i took off the password protection off my site ........ so everyone can view IRENE ........ i do n't wo n't people not to have the ability to view every model and Graphic when they need .UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A STRONG DEEP - LAYER RIDGE TO THE NORTH ...THE DEPRESSION CONTINUES TO MOVE RAPIDLY WESTWARD OR 270/18 .THIS GENERAL MOTION IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO .THEREAFTER ...A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC SHOULD CAUSE A GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE WEST - NORTHWEST WITH A REDUCTION IN FORWARD SPEED .This is Dean .Notice that he was supposed to turn WNW after a day or two and he ended up tracking the whole way across the Caribbean to the Yucatan Peninsula .This is from the first advisory .Related Video .Related Links .More Information .This image provided by NOAA shows Tropical Storm Karen taken late Thursday night Oct. 3 , 2013 .The National Hurricane Center in Miami said late Thursday that Karen was about 340 miles ( 547 kilometers ) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River and had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph ( 100 kph ) with higher gusts .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"59.85163"}
{"text":"Morning satellite image of Irene .Track forecast for Irene The computer models are in agreement that Irene will pass just south of Puerto Rico tonight , then hit the south coast of Hispaniola in the Dominican Republic or Haiti on Monday afternoon .Irene should then emerge into the channel between Haiti and Cuba on Tuesday afternoon , when the storm will have 12 or so hours over water before having to contend with Cuba .A trough of low pressure is expected to move across the Eastern U.S. on Wednesday and Thursday , turning Irene to the northwest and north by Thursday .The timing and strength of this trough varies considerably from model to model , and will be critical in determining where and when Irene will turn to the north .Irene 's strength will also matter -- a stronger Irene is more likely to turn northward earlier .Fay formed just off the coast of Puerto Rico , and was never quite able to get organized enough to become a hurricane , due to passage over Hispaniola and Cuba .Fay topped out as a strong tropical storm with 70 mph winds , and did over $ 500 million in damage in the U.S. , mostly due to flooding rains in Florida that accumulated to over 25 inches in a few areas .Fay also dumped heavy rains on Hispaniola , triggering flooding that claimed eight lives .Intensity forecast for Irene Irene is embedded in a large envelope of moisture now , and wind shear will remain low , 5 - 10 knots , for the next five days .With water temperatures very warm , 28 - 30 ° C , these conditions should allow for intensification except when land is interfering .Irene 's current appearance on satellite loops gives me the impression of a storm that is not fooling around , and I expect Irene will be a hurricane before hitting Hispaniola on Monday .Passage over Hispaniola will not destroy Irene , since it is a fairly large storm .Once the storm finishes with Hispaniola , it will have to deal with Cuba , which will keep Irene from intensifying significantly .Once Irene pops off the coast of Cuba Wednesday or Thursday into the Florida Straits , Irene will likely be a tropical storm .If the storm then has at least a day over water before hitting land , it will likely become a hurricane again , and could become a major hurricane if it ends up missing South Florida and moving over the warm waters on either side of the Florida Peninsula .Harvey hits Belize Tropical Storm Harvey made landfall at 2 pm EDT on Saturday near Dangriga Town , Belize , as a tropical storm with 60 mph winds .Harvey continues to dump very heavy rains on southern Mexico , but dissipation is expected tonight as the storm pushes inland .Harvey was a small storm , and the strongest winds were confined to a short stretch of coast near where the center came ashore .Winds at Belize City , Belize on Saturday topped out at 15 mph .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"60.1043"}

{"text":"The first eight storms this year have stayed below hurricane strength , making 2011 the first hurricane season since record keeping began in 1851 to have more than six consecutive tropical storms that did not reach hurricane strength .As I discussed in Friday 's post , a major reason for this is the lack of vertical instability over the tropical Atlantic so far this year .We 've had a large amount of dry , sinking air over the tropical Atlantic , and the usual amount of dry , dusty air from the Sahara , both helping to keep the atmosphere stable and stop this year 's storms from intensifying into hurricanes .Hurricane activity typically ramps up big - time by August 20 , with more than 80 % of all the hurricanes and 65 % of all the tropical storms occurring after that date .At our current pace , 2011 will become the second busiest Atlantic hurricane season on record , with 24 - 27 named storms .There are only 21 names in the list of names for a hurricane season , so we may have to break out the Greek alphabet again in late October this year , as occurred in 2005 .Ironically , this was the last time the current set of names was used in the Atlantic , so 16 of this year 's 21 names are repeats of 2005 .I 'm not too happy about seeing another hurricane season challenge the Hurricane Season of 2005 in any way , and let 's hope we do n't retire another five names this year , like occurred in 2005 !With vertical instability much lower this year than in 2005 , and that year having already seen one storm ( Dennis ) retired by this point in the season , I doubt that will happen , though .Figure 2 .The annual cycle of average hurricane frequency in the Atlantic .Historically , about 35 % of all the tropical storms and 15 % of all the hurricanes will have occurred by August 20 .Invest 98L near the Cape Verde Islands A tropical wave near Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa , Invest 98L , is spreading heavy rains and strong gusty winds to those islands today .So far this morning , top sustained winds measured in the Cape Verde Islands were 23 mph at Mindelo .98L has a long stretch of ocean to cross before it could affect any land areas .Approximately 70 - 80 % of all tropical cyclones that pass this close to the Cape Verde Islands end up curving out to sea and not affecting any other land areas , according to Dr. Bob Hart 's excellent historical probability of landfall charts .The latest set of long - range model runs go along with this idea , and I 'd be surprised if 98L threatens any land areas .Quoting IKE : GMZ089 - 211530- SYNOPSIS FOR THE GULF OF MEXICO 430 AM CDT SUN AUG 21 2011 .SYNOPSIS ...TROPICAL DEPRESSION HARVEY INLAND NEAR 16.0N 60.4W AT 0900 UTC MOVING WNW OR 290 AT 19 KT .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"61.52522"}

''We have n't had any reports of people at the main emergency shelter , but I do n't know how many moved in with their families , ' ' she told The Associated Press .There 's no major damage so far - the occasional power line outage but the winds are picking up , ' ' she said .At 11 a.m. , Gert 's center was about 135 miles east - southeast of Bermuda and moving north at about 13 mph .Winds near 110 mph extended up to 140 miles from the storm 's center .Storm surges of up to 5 feet were projected for Bermuda , but the storm was expected to weaken and turn gradually to the north - northeast , the hurricane center said .On Monday , police warned people in low - lying areas to evacuate their homes and two schools were turned into emergency shelters .Islanders stocked up on emergency supplies .Gert is the biggest storm to threaten Bermuda since 1987 , when Hurricane Emily hit , moved offshore , and then struck again .Cruise ships diverted to other ports and several flights were canceled Monday .Hundreds of tourists fled before the airport closed Tuesday and an already struggling tourist industry began counting the cost of cancellations from its biggest market - the United States .We 've lost business , including group bookings , particularly after the progress of the hurricane was broadcast on U.S. networks , ' ' said Norm Masilar , general manager of the island 's biggest hotel , the Southampton Princess .Earlier in the week , Gert had top winds of up to 145 mph , making the system the fourth Category 4 storm of the Atlantic hurricane season .AP - NY-09 - 21 - 99 1151EDT .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"69.582794"}
