{"text":"While he often made birther jokes ( some are used as bumper stickers by birthers ) , Limbaugh also discussed Obama 's birth certificate many times , with great seriousness .In the middle of a discussion of Mark Sanford in June 2009 , Limbaugh suddenly brought up the birth certificate again : \" A friend of mine said , ' Where was Obama born ? 'And I do n't know .He 's not a native Hawaiian .Where was he born ?I do n't know .Supposedly Hawaii , but we do n't have independent confirmation of it . \"In July 2009 , Limbaugh was still endorsing the birther movement by referring to Obama as having \" no birth certificate .\" Limbaugh was leery of announcing that Obama had been born in Kenya , but his tacit endorsement of the birthers was still clear .WorldNetDaily editor - in - chief Joseph Farah ( ghostwriter of Limbaugh 's second book , and leader of a campaign to put up \" Where 's the Birth Certificate ? \" billboards around the country ) noted the importance of Limbaugh 's stand with the birthers : \" What that did is beyond Rush 's impact .It also gives other talk show hosts license to talk about this issue .... Rush is kind of the standard of talk show hosts .A lot of people emulate what he does .He crossed the Rubicon on that show , and I 'm very proud of him for doing it .\" Now , Limbaugh has finally taken the further step to confess openly that he 's a birther , something that he probably was all along but simply was too cowardly to admit .The man who gave Limbaugh the courage to come out of the birther closet was Donald Trump .Rush spoke with great admiration of his fellow birther : \" Donald Trump is providing a lesson on how to beat Barack Obama .Donald Trump is showing that the way to do that is you go after these people .\" Limbaugh 's willingness to admit his birther beliefs reflects the radical transformation of the Republican Party that Limbaugh himself led .Limbaugh has spawned a new generation of conspiracy nuts who have been so dumbed down by years of being Dittoheads that even plainly idiotic ideas like those of the birthers have become the mainstream of the conservative movement .And now Rush Limbaugh feels the need to lurch even further to the right in order to maintain his status as the leader of the lunatics .About Me .The Internet can be a scary place .Troll some of its darker corners , and you 'll find plenty of people who think that George W.

{"text":"Limbaugh engages in vicious racism and the complete fabrication of quotes to serve his bigoted agenda .It 's time for the media and his conservative supporters to stop defending Rush 's racism and instead acknowledge his bigotry and deceit as real .Do you even remember , folks , Earth Day 's founder , do you remember the story of Earth Day 's founder ?Do you even remember his name ?Ira Einhorn .Ira Einhorn was on stage hosting the first Earth Day event at Fairmount Park in Philadelphia , April 22nd , 1970 .Seven years later , the police raided his closet and found the composted body of his ex - girlfriend inside a trunk .Ira Einhorn , the father of Earth Day , killed and composted his girlfriend .And any time you mention this the Earth Day acolytes try to shut you up , and they do n't want you having any success at besmirching the image of their great leader .Except for the fact that Ira Einhorn was a murderer , pretty much everything Rush said is wrong .No one thinks that Einhorn was \" the father of Earth Day . \" The founder of Earth Day , as everyone knows , was Sen. Gaylord Nelson .The main organizer of the first Earth Day in 1970 was Denis Hayes .The first Earth Day was a nationwide phenomenon .The Philadelphia Earth Week was organized by a committee of 33 people , and it does not appear that Ira Einhorn was one of them .In Rush 's defense , some of the misinformation on his show came from a badly written piece by Remy Melina reprinted on MSNBC.com titled , \" Earth Day co - founder killed , composted girlfriend .\" That title alone should warn readers of the bias that would follow .Einhorn was a crackpot who called himself an environmentalist to help get himself attention .In 1977 , he murdered his girlfriend and hid her body in a trunk in his apartment , where the mummified body was later found .This is the \" composted \" girlfriend being mocked in the headline and the story .Since decomposed bodies have nothing to do with composting ( in fact , the body was found underneath some Styrofoam packing material ) , the only reason for putting this word in the story is to try to demean environmentalists .Melina 's article claims : \" Although Einhorn was only the master of ceremonies at the first Earth Day event , he maintains that Earth Day was his idea and that he 's responsible for launching it .\" It 's not clear that Einhorn really still maintains that Earth Day was his idea , since he 's serving a life sentence in prison and it does n't appear that Melina talked with him or did any actual journalism for her article .( Melina 's bio , by the way , indicates that \" Remy has written for the Long Island Press and Shut Up !Magazine . \")A Philadelphia Inquirer article from ten years ago , easily found on the web , revealed that Einhorn was n't the founder of Earth Day , nor was he the host of the Philadelphia Earth Day celebration .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.93861"}
{"text":"Almost all Greek heroes were said to be born of a human woman and a god - even Alexander the Great , Augustus and Pythagoras .The father typically was Zeus or Apollo .The god would come and sleep with the woman , pretending to be the husband or as a bolt of lightning , or some such .Greek mythology also shows up in the book of Genesis : the gods lusting after the women and coming down and mating with them .Why were they added to the Christian story ?Nugent : Jewish Christians , the first Christians , did n't believe in the virgin birth .They believed that Joseph was the biological father of Jesus .Part of their Christology was \" adoptionism\"-they thought Jesus was adopted as the unique son of God at some time later in life .There were disagreements about when - Mark suggests the baptism , Paul suggests the resurrection .Over time , gentile Christianity replaced Jewish Christianity .There were Jewish - Roman Wars .The Jewish Christians were marginalized and oppressed .The Gentile branch became dominant .Eventually we get the gospel of John which pushes the sonship of Jesus back to the beginning of time .This writer is at the other end of the spectrum from the Jewish Christians .But Matthew and Luke think that the sonship of Jesus began at birth .And they want to tell a story that reinforces this point .Matthew and Luke are the source of the Christmas story as most of us learned it .Why did n't the writers do a better job of cleaning the contradictions ?Nugent : They did , some .This is called the \" orthodox corruption of scripture .\" But it appears that these birth stories were added toward the end , so scripture got frozen before they could get integrated .I was raised that the bible was the literally perfect , \" inerrant \" word of God , essentially dictated by God to the writers .What you are saying about the Christmas story sure calls into question this point of view .Nugent : Which Bible ? !There are thousands of manuscript variations .Most biblical stories are probably fiction , not non - fiction .They are mythology in the deepest sense of the word .But we need to get beyond issue of whether biblical reports happened in the historical , physical sense to understand what they mean spiritually and mythically .Ok .Back to Christmas .Of all the images from the Christmas story , the one that people fall in love with most is angels .The Christmas story is full of angels , beings of light .Is this because of the solstice tradition ?Nugent : Actually it comes from the Hebrew Bible , the Jewish scriptures that were eventually adopted into the Christian Bible as the Old Testament .It also comes from the Jewish literature written between the Old and New Testaments that did n't get into the biblical canon .Some of these are even quoted in the New Testament , for example Enoch , from the 2nd Century BC .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.958466"}
