{"text":"On North Korea 's recent nuclear test , Abe said the international community can not tolerate such actions .The two were expected to continue discussions Friday over a working lunch at the White House .Abe is a nationalist and a keen advocate of stronger relations with Washington that have assumed more importance for Tokyo as it has locked horns in recent months with emerging power China over the control of unoccupied islands in the resource - rich seas between them .Abe , who arrived Thursday afternoon and will leave early Saturday , has been anxious for the meeting since he returned to power after a convincing election victory in December for his second stint as prime minister .He had resigned for health reasons in 2007 after serving for one year .The U.S. partnership with Japan , which hosts about 50,000 American forces , is an enduring one and a cornerstone of Washington 's Asia policy , but establishing a personal rapport between leaders has been difficult .As Japan has struggled with its prolonged economic malaise , there 's been a revolving door of prime ministers .Abe is the fifth since Obama took office .The U.S. will be gauging Tokyo 's intent to join negotiations on the Trans - Pacific Partnership , a region - wide free trade pact being pushed by Washington .Abe may give pointers but is widely expected to hold back from such a commitment , which is opposed by most of his party and Japan 's small but politically powerful farming lobby , at least until after key elections in July for the upper house .Joe Hinrichs , Ford Motor Co. 's president of the Americas , said that Abe should be told to open Japan 's automobile markets , because only about 4 percent of cars sold there are made by foreign auto companies .\" We hope the U.S. government will send a clear message that any future trade policy with Japan must ensure a level playing field and not come at the expense of American workers , \" he said Thursday .On the security issues roiling northeast Asia , the U.S. and Japan will show solidarity in the face of North Korea 's recent long - range rocket launches and last week 's nuclear test , and reiterate their support for the U.N. Security Council to agree upon tougher sanctions against Pyongyang .They could also discuss military cooperation and missile defense .More delicate will be how Obama and Abe address Japan 's dispute with China over the Japanese - administered Senkaku islands that flared after Tokyo nationalized some of them in September .China also claims the tiny islands , which it calls Diaoyu .It has stepped up patrols into what Japan considers its territorial waters , heightening concern that a conflict could be sparked .The tensions highlight the rivalry between China , the world 's second - largest economy , and Japan , which is the third .Tokyo accused China last month of locking weapons - guiding radar on a Japanese destroyer and a helicopter , in what it viewed as a dangerous escalation .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"31.826504"}

{"text":"Though serious questions remain about the nuclear threat posed by North Korea , a recently disclosed assessment by the Pentagon claims that Pyongyang has the ability to assemble a nuclear weapon small enough for launch via ballistic missile .The new information came at a Thursday budget session of the House Armed Services Committee , where US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel claimed all the same that North Korea is still not able to attack the US with a missile carrying a nuclear warhead .The assessment , which was prepared by the Defense Intelligence Agency for senior Obama administration officials and members of Congress , was classified - though a brief one - paragraph portion appears to have recently been declassified .Its existence came to light during the budget meeting , and The New York Times speculated that it would explain why the Obama administration recently fast - tracked a new anti - missile system to Guam and began work to strengthen missile interception defenses in Alaska and California .However , Clapper maintained at the hearing that North Korea 's 30-year - old leader is only pursuing Pyongyang 's long - standing strategy of using threats to push the international community to provide aid .With current tensions running high , the idea that the North 's army could successfully deploy a nuclear tipped intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) certainly will not help to calm frayed nerves .Still , there are significant questions regarding the country 's missile program , which is believed to be capable of a maximum range that includes portions of Alaska and close to Hawaii .Both the accuracy and distance that North Korea 's current missiles are capable of is a matter of dispute , but a series of launches since 2006 have attempted to perfect the country 's first domestic ICBM , the Taepodong-2 .Analysts believe the potential range of that missile to be anywhere between 4,500 and 10,000 kilometers , though most believe it capable of 6,700 km .As for nuclear tests , North Korea 's most recent attempt took place earlier in 2013 , and was preceded by another ballistic missile test launch in December which reached waters near the Philippines .According to Clapper , the regime in the North is believed to be close to fielding a \" road - mobile intercontinental ballistic missile . \"Regarding Kim 's goals with such a move , Clapper added , \" His primary objective is to consolidate , affirm his power .The belligerent rhetoric of late , I think , is designed for both an internal and an external audience .\"No matter what , Washington has been increasing its presence around the Korean Peninsula .The USS Fitzgerald , which is positioned next to North Korea , is capable of shooting down any missiles launched from the country .The ship was initially supposed to return to base in Japan following recent annual joint drills with the South , according to US defense officials .The advanced radar - evading F-22 Raptors were redeployed from Kadena Air Base in Okinawa to the Osan Air Base , which is the main American base in South Korea .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"49.77382"}

Gertner and Wernher von Braun .The first successful launch of a V-2 was on October 3 , 1942 , and began operation on September 6 , 1944 , against Paris , followed by an attack on London two days later .By the end of World War II , May 1945 , over 3,000 V-2s had been launched .The R-7 Semyorka was the first Intercontinental ballistic missile .A total of 30 nations have deployed operational ballistic missiles .Development continues , with around 100 ballistic missile flight t .. North Korea 's missile capabilities .North Korea 's missile capabilities .South Korean satellites picked up mobile missile systems being moved to the east coast of North Korea .The missiles in question are medium and long range ballistic missile systems .But it\\ 's not certain whaich missiles they are .It could be the KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missiles also known as Hwasong-13 or it could be Musudan intermediate range ballistic missiles .This kind of mobile missile systems are really meant for surprise attacks , something that stationary launch sites can not do .Mobile system are harder to locate and once launched its harder to calculate the launch time , the missiles trajectory and direction .So the US will have to deploy significant missile defense systems in order to cover for the potential targets .This includes reinforcing the Seventh Fleet deployed in Yokosuka in Japan .For now , nobody is certain on North Korea\\ 's ballistic missile capabilities .We\\'ll have to wait until April 15th , that will be the birthday of the founder of North Korea , Kim il Sung and its possible that Pyongyang will commemorate that day with a test launch .After all the North Koreans are known to hold symbolic shows of power on the birthdays of the founder .North Korea 's missile capabilities .published : 05 Apr 2013 .views : 36367 .South Korean satellites picked up mobile missile systems being moved to the east coast of North Korea .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"71.73374"}
