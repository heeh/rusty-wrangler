'Of course , these two choices are the same ; ' creating new rules ... that would limit the number of troops available ' is ' restricting funding for the war . 'The question is how the Murtha plan is portrayed in public , and how it is perceived by the American people .The Democrats have moved away from the Murtha plan because they believe they can not afford - politically - to be seen as ' restricting funding .

Norm Coleman , who has become prominent among Republican critics of Bush 's war policy , told me from his home state of Minnesota that he would oppose deauthorization and predicted that no more than two Republican senators would vote for it .One of those two Republican senators would have to be Nebraska 's Chuck Hagel , who has fearlessly critiqued Bush 's war policy .But Hagel told me that he is not inclined to support a repeal .If Hagel is lost , Democrats might fall short of the 50 votes necessary for final passage , much less the 60 necessary to close off debate .George W. Bush may be an unpopular president fighting an unpopular war , but Democrats are finding it hard to make war policy from Capitol Hill .Democrats do not cloak the political nature of their efforts .Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph Biden , participating in a Nevada forum for Democratic presidential candidates last week , exultantly announced to applause his intent to \" revoke the president 's authority that he was given . . .to go to war .\" The mantra is not limited to the presidential hopefuls from the Senate .On the campaign trail in New Hampshire , Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico also called for de - authorization ... .In contrast , the proposed 2007 de - authorization looks like a Democratic effort to escape the wrath of the antiwar party faithful .Of the 29 Democrats who voted for the 2002 war resolution over four years ago , 21 are still in the Senate , seven are up for reelection next year and three -- Biden , Christopher Dodd and Hillary Clinton -- are running for president ... .Hagel 's position is critical .Before the recess , Biden and Levin sought support from the conservative who had been one of only two Republicans to back their tough nonbinding resolution .Hagel has long been appalled by Bush 's war policy , but he is rightly suspicious of Democratic ploys that would have no impact on dire conditions in Iraq .Democrats will eventually have to face a tough choice : try to withdraq funding , or give up .I suspect that they will do this dance until the summer , when the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills will be moving through the Congressional process .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"66.83515"}

'Good time at the CPAC event last night , where Ace and Jack M , Dave at Garfield Ridge , Harrison from Innocent Bystanders and others were hanging around in the hotel bar .Regrettably , there were no drinks to be had - unless you had an hour or two to wait for service .Fortunately , someone was gracious enough to commandeer the piano and play tunes from ' Guys and Dolls . 'I believe the song I heard was the Tom Tancredo campaign theme : ' Luck be a Lady . 'With the end of waterboarding , I believe this is now the preferred method of getting suspected Al Qaeda operatives to talk .Michael Barone reminds us that there are lots of people that thinks US troops are not deployed to enough nations in the world - or at least , that they 're not deployed to the right nations .But the US military is limited , and our allies refuse to build the sort of muscular military needed to do the job : .In the Los Angeles Times , Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations makes a point I have long wanted to make .But he has done what I have n't bothered to do , which is to gather the numbers that make the case .The point is this : There are n't that many military troops in the world to provide much help to the United States when we choose to take military action .All through the Iraq conflict , Democrats and the mainstream media have been bemoaning the fact that American troops are bearing most of the burden .We should get our allies to help , they say - ignoring that something like 32 other nations have sent troops to Iraq .The problem is that they do n't have all that many troops to send .Any large military operation is inevitably going to be mostly American .Citizens questioned in public opinion polls can perhaps be forgiven for assuming that there 's all kinds of help we can get out there if we only say pretty please and in something other than a Texas accent .But serious public officials and serious people in mainstream media should know better .And if they think that the relative paucity of available foreign troops is a problem , they should direct their complaints to those who can do something about it and call on our NATO allies to increase their military budgets .What 's the effect of this ?First and foremost , it encourages more unwelcome actions by rogue states like Iran and North Korea , who recognize that the world 's only policeman can only be in so many neighborhoods .Second , it probably makes things like ' surgical strikes ' more likely in places such as Iran , since the US recognizes the difficulty of a major ground operation .It also puts more influence in the hands of regional powers , who recognize that Washington ( and London , and Berlin ) are further away than ever .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"97.553215"}

{"text":"\" I do n't believe in litmus tests , \" Jeb Bush told Chuck Todd last November .But with the rise of an activist judiciary in the middle of the 20th century , constitutionalists have sought to rein in the power of the bench .If we were to compile a list of history 's most prolific mass murderers , who would we put on our list ?Attila the Hun ravaged the Roman Empire during the 5 th Century , killing and maiming all who stood in his way .In the 13 th Century , Ghengis Khan and his Mongol hordes roamed far and wide , creating a bloody empire that stretched from China and the Korean peninsula all the way to Iraq and Eastern Europe .From 1921 to 1959 , Josef Stalin ruled the Soviet Union with a cruelty unprecedented in human history , killing some 60 million of his own countrymen .In the 1930 's and 40 's , Adolph Hitler murdered some 6 million people - mostly Jews , Gypsies , and others who were deemed ineligible for membership in the \" master race . \"And from 1975 to 1979 , the Khmer Rouge , under the leadership of Pol Pot , murdered nearly 4 million in a wanton political \" cleansing \" of the Cambodian countryside .But who would we select as the greatest mass murderer of all time ?The leading candidate for that title would be American marine biologist Rachel Carson , the author of Silent Spring , the principal force behind the banning of the pesticide DDT and the godmother of radical today 's radical environmentalists of the political left .DDT is an odorless chemical pesticide used to control disease - carrying and crop - eating insects .Developed in Germany in 1874 , it did not come into common usage until World War II when it was effectively used for pre - invasion spraying of jungles and marshes .Following the war , it was widely used throughout the world as a means of combating yellow fever , typhoid fever , malaria , and other diseases carried by insects .Not only was DDT a major boon to the life expectancy of people throughout the world , it could be purchased for just pennies a pound .In India alone , the number of cases of malaria was reduced from 75 million to less than 5 million in just ten years .But then , in 1962 , Rachel Carson published her book , Silent Spring , and environmental activism quickly became a leading fad among American liberals .Carson charged that , as DDT entered the food chain , certain reproductive dysfunctions , such as thin eggs shells in some species of birds , might occur .In late 1971 , the Environmental Protection Agency initiated a series of hearings on the potential dangers of DDT .Although reliable statistics are hard to find , it is estimated that , i n the forty - five years since the banning of DDT , more than 9 billion cases of malaria have been reported , most of them in developing countries .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"134.04666"}
