{"text":"To get the story from someone who was part of the nascent gay - rights effort , and who has written extensively about Stonewall 's role as the galvanizing event of the movement , we turned to Martin Duberman .To Duberman , 82 , a historian , author of the 1993 book Stonewall and gay - rights activist for most of his life , Obama 's reference - and linking the watershed event to Selma , in particular - was a surprise .\" I was very startled ; I was pleased , \" he said Tuesday from his home in New York City .We asked Duberman to take us back to the late 1960s in New York City , where gay Americans there and across the nation were openly discriminated against in most areas of life , from the workplace to housing , from family life to free time .It was a time that every gay man Duberman knew in New York City would carry in his wallet the telephone number of the only two lawyers in the city \" who could get you out of jail in case you were arrested by plainclothes police officers . \"The Stonewall Inn , in Greenwich Village , was one of the few places where gay men , almost all necessarily closeted , could gather .It was an unlicensed establishment because , at the time , it was illegal to serve alcoholic beverages to gay people . \" Stonewall was probably the most popular gay male bar in New York in the late ' 60s , \" Duberman said .\" It was one of the few , or maybe the only place where you could dance . \"Today and every day , my Administration continues our efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies , support maternal and child health , and minimize the need for abortion .On this anniversary , we recommit ourselves to supporting women and families in the choices they make and redouble our efforts to promote safe and healthy communities .The White House will not oppose a House Republican bill to raise the debt limit for three months - despite President Barack Obama 's statement last week that a short - term extension \" does severe damage \" to the economy .The administration said in a statement that the bill \" introduces unnecessary complications , needlessly perpetuating uncertainty in the Nation 's fiscal system , \" but it welcomes the GOP effort to remove the immediate threat of default .The bill \" indicates that congressional Republicans have backed off an insistence on holding the Nation 's economy hostage to extract drastic cuts in Medicare , education , and other programs that middle - class families depend on , \" according to the \" statement of administration policy . \"\" For these reasons , the Administration would not oppose a short - term solution to the debt limit and looks forward to continuing to work with both the House and the Senate to increase certainty and stability for the economy . \" The statement is a reversal of sorts from the president 's remarks during a press conference last week , when he was asked about a short - term renewal .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"96.87416"}
