Bush does , ensuring that many , many children are torn from their parents , after all .He does this in the name of Papers , not in the name of human rights or dignity .President Obama and Janet Napolitano brag to the Republicans that they are deporting record numbers of undocumented immigrants .He turns his back on his own disabled aunt when the cold eye of ICE falls upon her .He sends troops to the US ' Southern border , when the economic refugees flee conditions in Mexico that have been greatly caused by NAFTA policies ( a Democratic accomplishment under Bill Clinton ) .Those people risking rape , murder , starvation , and poverty to cross the border to find a chance at life do n't need bullets in their heads ; they need help accessing resources so they do n't need to flee their homes and families .We 've seen how successful Arizona 's SB 1070 has been in disrupting society , and at driving a wedge between local police and many communities where people fear either being detained or simply being hassled based on ethnic signifiers .Many police have protested the implementation of S - Comm , understanding right away how it would harm their relationship with the immediate community and lend a hand to the proliferation of many crimes that would exploit this wedge .A few cities attempted to opt out of S - Comm , but voila !The cloak came off and Obama 's DHS suddenly informed these cities that the program was not , after all , voluntary .Whoops .Immigrant communities understand that they are being targeted when they are just trying to feed their kids and make a living , often exploited by workplaces that know they live without protection from law or society .But to console the rest who do n't know this , Obama 's White House claims it is only deporting serious criminals .The most cursory examination of reality shows this to be a complete falsehood .One easy example of this is shown quite blatantly by how the White House is going after activist , friend , and law school student Prerna Lal .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"53.6054"}

{"text":"Smith explains that genocide is a logic that upholds colonialism ; the narrative and illusion that native peoples have simply disappeared from this land affords rightful claim to all non - indigenous groups .And , orientialism , directed at immigrants of color no matter how long they have been in the U.S. , is used to justify the constant state of war to protect itself from enemies .Smith argues that even members of oppressed groups can become complicit in the oppression of other groups by embracing these logics .In many ways , Ben Carson 's complicity in vilifying Muslims functions as strategic use of one of the logics of white supremacy .As a racial \" other \" seeking our nation 's highest political office , Ben Carson must prove his commitment to maintaining the status quo through maintaining each of the pillars in order to be considered as a serious and viable candidate .To many white voters , his blackness serves to legitimate racist claims against Muslims as it does with criticisms of his own racial group .Ultimately , Carson 's Orientalist rhetoric makes him an especially seductive candidate for perpetuating white America 's commitment to colorblind ideology .In other words , for a white person looking to publicly prove their racial indifference despite their internal racist attitudes , a Black candidate spewing Islamophobic hatred is an especially enticing option at the polls .When it comes talking about race , most white people know that the acceptable stance is to be \" race neutral \" - say the wrong thing , and you might be labeled a \" racist \" - the scarlet letter of our so - called \" post racial \" society .Our collective failure is that most people have a limited understanding of what racism actually is , and do not see Carson 's Islamophobia as racism .It seems that Orientalism , and in this case Islamophobia as a specific manifestation of Orientalism , has joined traditional white racism as a publicly acceptable way to manifest bigotry .But displacement in the form of overt Islamophobia does nothing to help heal the very real wounds of our country 's continuing legacy of racialized oppression , as it too is racism .Instead , displacement of racial angst serves to strengthen the very phenomenon it wishes to evade .We must also consider the implications of the 29 % of Americans who , well into Obama 's second term , still maintain that he is a Muslim - even after significant proof has been provided that he is in fact a practicing Christian .While it is taboo in our colorblind society to claim that one has a problem with Obama as President because of the color of his skin , re - configuring him as a Muslim is a convenient way to protest his position in power without seeming \" racist . \" In this way , it is possible to use the racist logic of Orientalism to avoid being perceived as an overt racist complicit in the hierarchical positioning of whites as superior to every other race .Carson may also be using this rhetoric as a tactic to strategically distance himself from President Obama and appeal to voters who will inevitably find a way to conflate the two Black men , despite their dramatically different political attitudes .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"55.34504"}

Dr. Martin Luther King .Seems more fitting she would have a show about the work of Dr. King and countless other humanitarians , especially in this toxic climate concerning our President , as an African American , and the people who are working to make the King dream a reality .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"58.274097"}

Kennedy Serve America Act , which will ensure that his legacy of service will live on in the good works of millions of Americans for years to come .Senator Kennedy was much more than a great liberal lion and master orator .He was a pragmatist who reached across the aisle to pass legislation that has improved the lives of people around the world .I particularly admired his bi - partisan leadership on health care , education , and immigration reform , and he was a critical ally in our efforts to ensure that all 9/11 first responders receive the care and treatment they deserve .Today , on behalf of all New Yorkers , I extend my deepest condolences to his wife , Victoria , his sister Jean , his children , and his entire extended family .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"63.519485"}

Bush : A Reflection of Our Collective Psychosis - by Paul Levy FOREWORD By Mark Comings This book that you hold in your hands by Paul Levy is a landmark contribution to an emerging integral psychology .It illuminates the deeper nature of our world crisis through a novel perspective that synthesizes psychology with recent discoveries in physics , doing so in a deeply spiritual context .Paul uses the current Bush administration as a compelling case study which reveals the character and structure of a collective psycho - spiritual malady .The severity of the planetary crisis currently engulfing us is so great that we need to call forth and integrate the best maps of reality available to us in all fields and use this evolving synthesis to wisely address the problems facing us .Paul 's book is a significant contribution in this direction , and is an example of the kind of integrated approach that is urgently needed at this time .The two general domains of knowledge from which we can gain useful guidance in navigating our way through the turbulence of our times are the spiritual and the scientific .We are witnessing a profound convergence and synthesis of these two realms that have been divided and kept separate in western culture for many centuries .This spiritual - scientific synthesis is of great interest and concern to me , as it represents the healing of a deep epistemological rift that has shattered our integral wholeness in ways enormously crippling to us as a species .The process of creating bridges between new science and spiritual / psychological perspectives represents the process of repairing this split in our collective consciousness , thereby moving us toward the healing of our species .Paul is drawing a new and powerful picture for us .There is much talk in physics about the participatory universe .But very rarely is this connected to the deterioration and failure of civil society and our opportunity to translate the understanding of reality coming out of the new physics into social responsibility and political activism .This book represents a breakthrough in the understanding of how the collective human psyche operates as a non - local field of energy , information and sentience ( the quality of having awareness ) .This perspective is distinctly different from that of present - day mainstream psychology , which views the psyche in purely local terms , i.e. , each person 's psyche is located and confined , more or less , within the locus of their physical body .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"68.197815"}

' \" Weinstein says the way the Fox Nation article paints Obama Sr . \" has it all : polygamy , the suggestion of illicit interracial sex , and the predatory sexual appetites of a dark - skinned African man .In fact , this theme 's got a name , or a couple of names , in popular Western culture : ' Black beast , ' ' black buck , ' ' Mandingo . 'It 's the theory that black males are more animal than human , with an insatiable predilection for defiling white ( read : virtuous ) women .\" Weinstein quotes Harvard psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint as writing in 1972 : \" There is little doubt that our white countrymen have been in a chronic state of paranoid fear over black male sexual power .

Bush .This would be to miss the entire point of what Paul is saying .Bush is simply an acute and prominent example serving to illuminate the deep and insidious nature of the collective mental disorder afflicting our species .This is not your typical Bush - bashing book .Though it seems to be about Bush , it is really about ourselves .Paul identifies and elucidates the structure and dynamics of the collective trance from which humanity needs to wake up from so that we may stop dreaming up nightmares for ourselves .We , as a species , have been suffering from a pervasive form of mis - knowledge about the nature of the universe , and ourselves as well .We keep trying solutions that are premised on a view of reality that is false , which ensure that our attempts at resolution will never succeed .One of the implicit and generally unrecognized problems underlying our world crisis is that we tend to be entranced by fixating our attention on a superficial level of explicate ( outer manifest forms ) and seemingly separate patterns that make up our world .By having our awareness constricted and focused in such a limited way , we are not seeing , attending to or feeling the deeper , undivided , invisible , and indivisible field and its non - local dynamics which are responsible for shaping world events in a fundamental way .These non - local forces are the formative agents of the patterns of outer events and are only to be discovered in one place within our own subjective experience , that is , within our minds .There has been a critically important breakthrough in physics in the last few decades that has radically changed our understanding of the nature of Nature .What has been discovered is that an underlying assumption -- known as \" the principle of locality\"--implicit in our scientific understanding of the physical world for centuries , is categorically wrong at the deepest level of nature .Locality refers to a tacit or unconscious assumption about the nature of physical reality .It is the view , arising from our day to day experiencing of the macroscopic physical world , that the world is comprised of apparently separate things or mechanistically interacting parts .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"71.23596"}

Garcia notes in his book on Latino Politics .While we also share important common denominators such as the experience of discrimination and lack of inclusion in the U.S. as Feagin and Cobas describe , these subgroup differences are large enough to generate diverse policy interests or at the least differences in strategy .So , it should come as no surprise that there are issues where there is dissent between Latino groups and that is only going to become more frequent .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"73.78757"}

Barsade- \" a process in which a person or group influences the emotions or behavior of another person or group through the conscious or unconscious induction of emotion states and behavioral attitudes \" .Social contagion is imitative behavior based on the power of suggestion and imitative influence .Social contagion operates on four levels - emotional , behavioral , ideational , and hysterical - and depending on which level appears to be predominant , psychologists categorize social contagion accordingly : .But is that really all there is to it ?Do we err fundamentally by ascribing \" psychological \" rather than \" physiological \" causes to these modalities of contagious mass behaviour ?Where exactly does agency reside within our composite organism ?What again , is the optimal unit of selection driving individual and \" species \" behaviour ?I 'm not convinced that the people launching these racial slurs necessarily harbor any feelings of racial superiority , and I 'm therefore very nervous about the idea of pursuing extraordinary punitive measures against them .But I have begun to think that this anxiety may stem from some confusion about what constitutes \" racism \" , and what the purpose of hate crimes legislation is supposed to be .As some of the other commenters have noted , it might be interesting for DeAngelo to ask himself whether his reaction would have been so much different had the driver presented as a member of some group other than \" Latino \" .Had it been an overweight white lady with an Indigo Girls bumper sticker , might he not have thought angry things about fat dykes ?Had it been a black dude blasting hip - hop from his black SUV , might he not have thought angry things about gangsta thugs ?And so on .UBM points out that we all harbor anger and fear toward the Other , but I think even that statement simplifies what 's going on here .When we are angry with someone for any reason , however petty or reasonable , we reach for weapons with which we can 1 ) make the person feel bad , and 2 ) distance ourselves psychologically from the person .Dehumanizing the object of our anger , and defining the person as Other -- as someone outside your tribe -- fulfills a number of psychological aims .It makes it easier to fight the person without hesitation if that becomes neessary .It helps to rally support for you and against your opponent from those defined as members of your tribe .And so on .My point , I guess , is this : .In - group / out - group psychology is universal .It 's a primate thing , and it was really useful when we were first coming out of the trees .It can be a little more problematic these days .Our culture provides templates for us to create this Other ; it gives us the tools we need to build our own racist caricatures at those moments we decide we want one .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"80.190735"}

Kennedy and his brother Robert , then serving as Attorney General of the United States , and they were instrumental in guiding its leadership and providing focus in its early years .Senator Kennedy took up that leadership mantle for the Lawyers ' Committee and never laid it down .He was a civil rights giant and our irreplaceable advocate , always encouraging and supporting us to continue to fulfill the vision of his brothers .He understood that leadership by the private bar in the struggle for racial equality and justice for our nation 's most vulnerable citizens is critical .In 2003 , at its 40th anniversary gala , the organization honored Senator Kennedy with the Beacon of Justice Award in recognition of his lifetime accomplishments in advancing civil rights .His passion for seeking equal justice for all was undiminished throughout his long career .He was a primary sponsor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act passed in 2008 and has recently spoken of the inherent right of all Americans to quality health care .We extend sincere condolences to his wife Victoria , his children and to the entire Kennedy family and wish them peace during this difficult time .The Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law ( LCCRUL ) , a nonpartisan , nonprofit organization , was formed in 1963 at the request of President John F. Kennedy to involve the private bar in providing legal services to address racial discrimination .The principal mission of the Lawyers ' Committee is to secure , through the rule of law , equal justice under law , particularly in the areas of fair housing and fair lending , community development , employment ; voting ; education and environmental justice .Since that time , their initial faith in Senator Kennedy has been richly rewarded many times over .With his unmatched passion for justice and vision of boundless opportunity for every American , Senator Kennedy devoted his extraordinary legislative skills to bringing real , lasting and beneficial change to our nation .He made America a better and more hopeful place .Active and engaged nearly to the end of his extraordinary life and career , his loss will be deeply felt by all who continue to dream of America 's promise fulfilled .We will miss him , and at this sad moment we convey our deepest condolences to the Kennedy family .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"80.91858"}

Rice at the Human Rights First Annual Summit Washington , DC Wednesday , December 4 , 2013 .Good afternoon , everyone .And thank you so much Elisa for your incredibly kind introduction , but even more I want to thank you for your long career fighting the good fight , and for your dedicated leadership of Human Rights First .For more than three decades , this group has been a clarion voice in defense of human dignity and the rights and freedom of people everywhere .And it really is my deep honor to be with you today .These same rights are reflected in the founding documents of the United States , and we cherish them as part of our national character .We have to work relentlessly to make them real .I know everyone in this room believes , as I do , that continuing their work at home and expanding it around the globe is our great commission as the inheritors of their legacy .For me , the struggle for equal human rights is deeply personal .I can never forget that I am the daughter of proud citizens who suffered the indignities of Jim Crow .Nor can I forget that , in 1964 , the year of my birth , in many parts of this great country , people who looked like me could not vote or marry someone who looks like my husband .No one understands this profound responsibility more keenly than President Obama .From his Nobel Prize acceptance speech to his remarks at the United Nations in September , he has been clear about the principles that guide us and to which we hold ourselves accountable , even as we navigate an increasingly complex world of competing and overlapping challenges .Make no mistake : advancing democracy and respect for human rights is central to our foreign policy .That is why the United States remains firmly committed to promoting freedom , opportunity and prosperity everywhere .We stand proudly for the rights of women , the LGBT community and minorities .We defend the freedom for all people to worship as they choose , and we champion open government and civil society , freedom of assembly and a free press .We support these rights and freedoms with a wide range of tools , because history shows that nations that respect the rights of all their citizens are more just , more prosperous and more secure .But , we can not and we should not bear that burden alone .Yet , obviously , advancing human rights is not and has never been our only interest .Every U.S. president has a sworn duty to protect the lives and the fortunes of the American people against immediate threats .We must defend the United States , our citizens and our allies with every tool at our disposal , including , when necessary , with military force .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"85.08971"}

BUSH :A REFLECTION OF OUR COLLECTIVE PSYCHOSIS by Paul Levy .In this ground - breaking work , Paul Levy explores whether the madness that George W. Bush has fallen into is showing us something particularly important about ourselves .What if Bush 's madness is a reflection of our own potential for madness ?What if Bush has been collectively dreamed up to play out , in full - bodied form , a pathological role existing deep within the collective unconscious of all humanity ?Though this book centers on George Bush , it is ultimately about ourselves .In The Madness of George W. Bush : A Reflection of Our Collective Psychosis , Levy analyzes the current state of our world as if it is a mass shared dream all 6.4 billion of us are collaboratively dreaming up into materialization .Drawing heavily on the insights of the great doctor of the soul , C. G. Jung , Levy identifies the root process being dreamed up on the world stage is a collective psychosis he calls \" malignant egophrenia . \"He illumines how this disease of the psyche expresses itself non - locally ( not bound by space or time ) throughout the underlying unified field that connects us all , propagating itself through the unconscious blind spots of the collective .He points out that if the malignant egophrenia epidemic manifesting in our world continues to go unrecognized , it will result in endless suffering and self - destruction .Levy proposes that this collective madness is simultaneously revealing to us our potential for an evolutionary quantum leap in human consciousness .He concludes that whether we destroy ourselves as a species or wake up depends on enough of us recognizing what the insanity of our current world crisis is revealing to us .The choice , and responsibility , is truly ours .This book is an invaluable contribution to creating the change of hearts and minds that is the pathway to true evolution . \" -Catherine Austin Fitts , Former Assistant Secretary of Housing ( Bush 1 ) .\" The Jungian analysis by Paul Levy , of Bush and the culture which maintains him , reaches deep into the American psyche .It should be studied and digested by everyone .If the citizenry would recognize that Bush 's egomania is acting out a national illness , we would all be saner .If the US could integrate the \" shadow \" which Bush projects upon the \" the axis of evil , \" perhaps we could achieve world peace and start to solve global problems .A MUST READ . \"-Carol S.

Maggie Hassan , the only Democrat to join the anti - refugee talk , did not join .As growing numbers of governors including Florida 's Rick Scott were expressing opposition to the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their state , Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised the ante in an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham .Trump charged that the Obama administration is deliberately trying to resettle Syrian refugees in states with Republican governors while sparing states that have Democratic governors .They send them to the Republicans , not to the Democrats , you know , because they know the problems , \" Trump said on Nov. 17 , 2015 . \" In California , you have a Democrat as a governor ( Jerry Brown ) .In Florida , you have Rick Scott ( a Republican ) .So you know they send them to the Republicans because you know why would we want to bother the Democrats ?It 's just insane .Taking these people is absolutely insanity .Is the administration sending refugees to Republican - led states but not Democratic ones ?In a word , no .Whether the United States should accept Syrian refugees has become an urgent debate in the days since the terror attacks in Paris .At least 30 governors have said they 're against letting refugees into their states because of fears that terrorists could hide among those seeking political asylum .The unrest began in 2011 with protests against President Bashar al - Assad , in the wake of the pro - democracy Arab Spring .Assad 's regime responded with violence , and the country spiraled into a civil war .But it is n't just pro - Assad vs. anti - Assad groups .There are several sects fighting one another , one of which is the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , also known as ISIS or ISIL .Some have questioned whether one of the ISIS terrorists who participated in the Nov. 13 Paris attacks was a Syrian refugee who resettled in Europe .That fact remains unconfirmed ; authorities are still investigating .The six Paris attackers identified so far were French and Belgian nationals .Nonetheless , many American politicians are concerned that allowing Syrian refugees to settle in the United States would leave the country vulnerable .Miami - Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez wants \" additional assurances from federal authorities \" about the screening process of Syrian refugees before they are \" permitted to settle in our community , \" a spokesman said Friday .The statement by communications chief Michael Hernández stops short of backing the White House in an increasingly heated fight over whether the United States faces a terrorism risk from the 10,000 Syrian refugees the Obama administration agreed to accept from the war - torn country .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"100.67258"}

{"text":"Flint elected officials worried about getting elected again and not the water .State officials were content to follow Governor Rick Scott 's fiscal restraint agenda .No new taxes and reduction is State services .To be fair , Detroit was bankrupt and presented a huge fiscal mess , Flint just did n't rate that high .And , the Federal EPA was far more concerned with super fund sites and global warming , a shameful excuse .A Flint Primary would allow voters to register their demands for immediate action on a basic life requirement , clean water .The primary could make the unemployed voices clear that they wanted jobs so they could pay for the water , and by the way they demanded the water be lead free .The Flint Primary could vote out the incompetent and callous Flint officials who had allowed what they knew health - wise as clearly wrong to persist .The Flint Primary could also shine a bright light upon the \" no new taxes \" advocates who are happy to hold the line on taxes by reducing necessary government services .\" No new taxes \" may be defensible but only under conditions where existing services are made much more productive ( or eliminated ) so that funds could be applied to those essential services .In Michigan as in most other \" no new taxes \" States , there is little effort to ensure essential services continue , or to consider the need for necessary infrastructure repair and maintenance .The Flint Primary could do so much .Given the history off Flint resident 's complacency , I ca n't help but wonder , however , how many Flint residents would show up to vote .Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are going toe to toe for the Democrat Presidential nomination .One of Sanders ' stump speech trademarks is Clinton 's acceptance of $ 675,000 for speeches given to Wall Street firms .Last night she called him on it and asked what exactly did this money do to change her views on policies ?Hillary asked whether Bernie had a specific charge or was he just trying to \" smear \" her reputation ?Hmmm .Three hundred thousand plus does seem like a lot of money for an hours work .But is it ?Access to someone like Hillary , especially if she should become President would be \" priceless \" .And for these large banks , $ 325,000 is not too much money considering what they spend on lobbying anyways .And Hillary is not a new recipient , former Secretary of States Powell and Rice both have received large honorariums .So , is Bernie pointing out a naked attempt to influence a public figure and potential President , or is he just pointing out a questionable practice ?More probable these firms were willing to spend these large sums of money because Clinton ( and former senior Government officials ) had both fresh insight and direct knowledge of happenings around the world , including developments in foreign capitals .Hillary also had insight into thinking within the White House and the Administration 's view of the domestic economy .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"117.407776"}

G. Jung himself went through a severe shamanic crisis , during which many of his colleagues thought he had gone insane .He wrote about his initiation in the chapter of his autobiography called \" Confrontation with the Unconscious , \" and he reminds us that the demonic is \" the not yet realized creative .\" The idea is that inherent in the demonic is a blessing , is our creative power .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"118.56471"}
