{"text":"Hillary Clinton , Bernie Sanders and the Real Definition of ' Progressive ' .At the Democratic debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on Thursday night , the candidates ' discussion of the issues branched into slightly unusual territory : semantics .It was a thorny debate - but , it turns out , the question of what it means to be progressive in America is even more complicated than that . \" Historians do n't have a definition [ of ' progressive ' ] and we 've argued for years over whether there is such a thing , \" says Charles Postel , an expert on the Progressive and Populist movements who teaches history at San Francisco State University .Yes , there was a specific Progressive Party ( a.k.a the Bull Moose Party , which backed Theodore Roosevelt 's 1912 run for the White House ) and a specific Progressive Era , during the first 15 or 20 years of the 20th century .\" This is something that historians now talk about as the ' long Progressive Era , ' \" Postel says .What 's striking about the more narrowly defined Progressive Era , Postel adds , is not so much that reformers had new ideas during that time but that they were remarkably successful in getting things done .And with so many activists making strides , it 's hard to say who should get credit for starting things or which causes were most central .But , while it 's hard to pinpoint a beginning and end for the Progressive Era , it 's a bit easier to list the reforms that set it apart .Postel argues that today 's use of the word \" progressive \" is n't substantively different from the modern use of the word \" liberal , \" which has its own , perhaps even more complicated history .During the Reagan years , \" liberal \" acquired a bad reputation and eventually \" progressive\"-with a lower - case \" p\"-came back . )But there 's a logic to the Democratic candidates wanting that linguistic link to the early Progressives .First of all , Postel says , it 's worth noting that today 's politicians who claim the progressive mantel do share a lot with their forebears .Sanders ' respect for Eugene Debs , the socialist leader of the Progressive Era , who believed that the Progressive Party had stolen the Socialist platform , is well known .As for Clinton , the historian sees a strong connection between the political stances and personal lives of the candidate and Jane Addams , one of the foremost female activists of the Progressive Era .And the policies that mark a modern candidate as progressive are generally ones that would be recognized by the reformers of a century ago . \"Today racial justice is an integral part of progressivism . \" )So , given all that history , are today 's Democratic candidates truly progressive ?Is one more progressive that the other ?Who was right on Thursday ?If you ask Postel , both candidates were correct , but in slightly different ways .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"65.76961"}

{"text":"But do n't expect them to give any credit to Obama .That would be sacrilege .For the past few months ( years ? ) , the Republican Party has been fixated on a single issue that crowded out any other topic of political conversation .Terrorism , taxes , climate change , abortion , the economy - you name it - was ultimately shoved aside in favor of bashing the Affordable Care Act ( aka ObamaCare ) .Health care has dominated the news coverage on Fox News on virtually every program .That is , until Vladimir Putin sent his troops into the Ukrainian province of Crimea .This begs the question : What is it about this matter that supersedes the GOP obsession with ObamaCare ?Why is the conflict between a couple of former Soviet states such a powerful draw for America 's Tea Party extremists ?After all , not too long ago , Crimea was , in fact , a part of Russia .It was just in 1954 that the Soviet Russian Republic ceded control of Crimea to the Soviet Ukraine Republic via a \" Decree of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet \" that stated it was ... .This is not unlike the transfer of authority for Ellis Island from New York to New Jersey by the Supreme Court .The Soviet leadership certainly did not anticipate that their country would break up and the newly independent Ukraine would scamper off with Crimea .Sixty years later , Crimea is still a predominately Russian community .Seventy - five percent of its population is ethnic Russian .And while the referendum vote last Sunday was rampant with obvious fraud , it is unarguable that a majority of the Crimean residents still associate themselves with Russia .The map below illustrates how segregated the population is .In the blue areas the residents speak Ukrainian .In the red area , virtually all of Crimea , they speak Russian .If there were ever a regional conflict that the United States had little business poking its massive proboscis into , it is this one .It 's fine to take sides rhetorically and even to organize a coalition of nations to advocate on behalf of sovereignty and independence , but rattling the sabers of war over a regional matter that is of no national interest to the U.S. is irresponsible and dangerous .Repeating the mistakes of the previous administration will only cost more American lives without securing anything of value for the loss .Ron Paul , in a disagreement with his senator son Rand , asked the key question saying \" Why does the U.S. care which flag will be hoisted on a small piece of land thousands of miles away ? \" The hypocrites who assert that Obama 's foreign policy is responsible for inviting Putin 's aggression fail to recognize that Putin has never looked to the U.S. for permission to embark on his military misadventures .If that were true , those conservative critics would need to explain what it was about George W. Bush 's foreign policy that invited Putin to invade Georgia .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"68.6355"}

Bush and Richard Nixon , the Republican Party has moved much further to the right in recent years .This leaves the question as to whether it will matter if Clinton or a Republican wins - which is more difficult to say without knowing which Republican will be the GOP nominee .It is definitely possible that there will be no meaningful difference with regards to foreign policy and civil liberties issues if Clinton or a Republican wins .There is the danger that the next president will be hostile to government transparency , and nobody has reached the level of the Clinton corruption in using the office of the presidency to enhance their personal worth .We will probably see a continuation of the surveillance state and of the drug war regardless of whether Clinton or a Republican wins .The biggest danger in a Clinton presidency would be that many Democrats will support conservative policies , leaving a weak liberal opposition to her policies , while there would be greater unity in opposing what might even be the exact same policies coming from Republicans .The biggest upside to Clinton winning over the Republicans might be that after campaigning as a progressive for the nomination , she will continue to govern as one .At very least Clinton would support a handful of liberal positions such as reproductive rights if elected .While this would be favorable , it is hardly enough to be happy with the prospect of her election considering her many conservative views .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"69.39421"}

Rand Paul ( Republican )Fun fact : Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is a practicing ophthalmologist that specializes in corneal transplants , cataract and glaucoma surgeries and LASIK procedures .The 52-year - old constitutional conservative has spent time during every senate recess performing pro - bono eye surgeries for low income Kentuckians and citizens of poor countries like Haiti .Even if he wins the presidency , Paul claims he will continue his practice and joked about turning the Lincoln room into a surgical suite .It 's probably safe crown Paul as having one of the greatest political ads in a long time , courtesy of America 's Liberty PAC .What 's up with the campaign ?Paul is probably the most libertarian candidate of the bunch .He 's all about citing the 10th Amendment , dreams of abolishing the IRS and wants to severely cut the defense budget and end the surveillance state .He 's also one of the only Republicans that seemingly has the backing of millennials .He has all the ingredients of a solid Republican candidate , a true conservative that literally takes a chainsaw to the tax code and genuinely wants to dismantle the \" Washington Machine .\" Even liberals can appreciate his non - interventionist foreign policy agenda and acknowledging the threat of climate change .However , the crowded GOP race has n't treated Paul nicely .He has struggled to make it to five percent in national polls , fighting for scraps with Carly Fiorina and Gov. Chris Christie .Some point to Paul 's troubles being that libertarianism is an extreme minority in America 's political landscape , which would also explain his father 's performance when he ran for president .In a 2014 study , Pew Research found that only 11 percent of Americans identify as Libertarians and know what it is .Conservatives say they want a smaller government , but that 's not what we see in the astonishing support for Donald Trump and Dr. Ben Carson who call for expanding surveillance programs and a further expansion of the government 's military footprint .Paul 's attack on Sen. Marco Rubio for being \" liberal on military spending \" gets roaring applause from a Republican audience ; aggressive military spending , however , creates an even bigger applause line .It 's worth pointing out that if the White House does n't work out , he 's also running for reelection in Kentucky 's 2016 senate race .He invokes the 10th Amendment and classic libertarian values regarding pot , saying the only victim is the individual and that the federal government should n't have a role in controlling consumption .Paul wants less people in jail and shines a light on the victims of marijuana prohibition mostly being poor black males .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"72.67088"}

Bush did it ) .The infatuation that Fox has for Putin is palpable .But it is also opportunistic .They only admire him so long as they can convert their idolatry of Putin into disparagement of Obama .They tried the same thing with conflicts involving Syria and Iran , but after the administration 's success in forcing both countries to retreat from their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction , Fox News likewise retreated .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"75.767395"}

{"text":"Crisis Scenario # 4 is the money scenario .This is where Palin said that \" After the Russian Army invaded the nation of Georgia , Senator Obama 's reaction was one of indecision and moral equivalence , the kind of response that would only encourage Russia 's Putin to invade Ukraine next . \"Notice that Palin did not say what Obama 's response was or why it would encourage Putin in future military endeavors .For the record , here is what both Obama and John McCain said at the time : .Obama : There is no possible justification for these attacks .I reiterate my call for Russia to stop its bombing campaign , to stop flights of Russian aircraft in Georgian airspace , and to withdraw its ground forces from Georgia .McCain : Russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign Georgian territory .If Obama was indecisive and lacking moral fortitude , it was in exactly the same measure as Palin 's running mate , McCain .Palin 's remarks were nothing more than the typical carping that occurs in campaigns that have nothing of substance to say .Instead , Palin asserts an absurd scenario wherein Putin would require \" encouragement \" to engage in military aggression , as if he 's looking to the west for validation .If that 's so , what did George W.

Ted Cruz , who was a law clerk for Chief Justice William Rehnquist in 1996 , noted Saturday the impact Scalia had on the judiciary .And he authored some of the most important decisions ever , including District of Columbia v. Heller , which recognized our fundamental right under the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms .He was an unrelenting defender of religious liberty , free speech , federalism , the constitutional separation of powers , and private property rights .What Were His Opinions of Some of the Most Controversial Legal Decisions in Recent History ?When it came to the topic of abortion , Scalia argued that there is no constitutional right to abortion .In the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey , Scalia wrote in his dissenting opinion : \" The States may , if they wish , permit abortion on demand , but the Constitution does not require them to do so .The permissibility of abortion , and the limitations upon it , are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy : by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting .In the landmark Supreme Court decision in June 2015 that legalized same - sex marriage in all 50 states , Scalia blasted the majority opinion , calling it a \" judicial Putsch \" and a \" threat to American democracy .What Were Scalia 's Appointments Before the Supreme Court ?Prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court , Scalia was appointed Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1982 .He also served as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel from 1974 to 1977 , Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States from 1972 to 1974 and General Counsel of the Office of Telecommunications Policy from 1971 to 1972 .Scalia 's Family Life .Scalia is survived by his wife , Maureen , whom he married in 1960 , five sons and four girls -- Ann Forrest , Eugene , John Francis , Catherine Elisabeth , Mary Clare , Paul David , Matthew , Christopher James and Margaret Jane .Alex Wong / Getty Images ( WASHINGTON ) -- President Obama has been informed of the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , and has offered his condolences to the Scalia family , White House officials said Saturday .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"90.40328"}

S. are twice as high as any other industrialized country .Most large corporations still pay a big chunk of their employees ' health care insurance premiums .Some are obligated by union contracts to pay an even larger percentage and to provide coverage for retirees .Many operate profitably in countries with national health care systems where they pay far less towards healthcare costs than they do in the U.S ..So , from a straight bottom line business perspective , corporations should be leading the fight to replace our dysfunctional , overpriced , for - profit private insurance system with a single - payer , Medicare - for - All model .Yet more than 20 years after the crisis of escalating health insurance premiums first hit the corporate radar screens , not a single major U. S. corporation has come forward to advocate for replacing employment - based health insurance with a comprehensive national healthcare system .What gives ? published Jan 12 , 2016 in the Portland Business Journal by Dr. Samuel Metz , Guest columnist .Next November , some lucky citizens will vote for ( or against ) a statewide universal healthcare system .But they wo n't be Oregonians .Colorado healthcare advocates just placed Initiative 20 ( \" ColoradoCare \" ) on its November 2016 ballot .If approved , this detailed proposal would make Colorado the first state to replace its fragmented healthcare financing system ( similar to Oregon 's and all other states ) with a program providing health care access to every resident .Federal programs ( e.g. Medicare , Veterans Affairs ) would remain untouched .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"92.15759"}

Patriot Act , a law that the Bush White House pushed through Congress in October , 2001 , and which included major changes to FISA .Tucked into the bill , in Section 215 , was something called the \" business records \" provision .It allowed the government to seize \" any tangible thing \" from a company as long as officials proved to the FISA court that the item was \" sought for an investigation to protect against international terrorism .\" Of the many new powers that Congress granted law enforcement through the Patriot Act - roving wiretaps , delayed - notice search warrants - this was not the most controversial provision at the time .It was often innocuously described as the \" library records \" provision , conjuring the notion that the government should know if someone is checking out bomb - making books .Some members of Congress were satisfied with the wording because Representative Jim Sensenbrenner , a Republican who was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee , and who wrote the Patriot Act , had defeated an effort by the Bush White House to make the provision even more expansive .As Wyden later wrote , \" The idea was that these provisions would be more thoughtfully debated at a later , less panicked time . \"The Patriot Act passed overwhelmingly .( Russ Feingold , of Wisconsin , was the only senator to oppose it . )Three months later , the Defense Department started a new program with the Orwellian name Total Information Awareness .T.I.A. was based inside the Pentagon 's Information Awareness Office , which was headed by Admiral John Poindexter .In the nineteen - eighties , Poindexter had been convicted , and then acquitted , of perjury for his role in the Iran - Contra scandal .He wanted to create a system that could mine a seemingly infinite number of government and private - sector databases in order to detect suspicious activity and preëmpt attacks .The T.I.A. system was intended to collect information about the faces , fingerprints , irises , and even the gait of suspicious people .In 2002 and 2003 , Wyden attacked the program as a major affront to privacy rights and urged that it be shut down .In the summer of 2003 , while Congress debated a crucial vote on the future of the plan , Wyden instructed an intern to sift through the Pentagon 's documents about T.I.A. The intern discovered that one of the program 's ideas was to create a futures market in which anonymous users could place bets on events such as assassinations and terrorist attacks , and get paid on the basis of whether the events occurred .Wyden called Byron Dorgan , a Democratic senator from North Dakota , who was also working to kill the program .\" Byron , we 've got what we need to win this , \" he told him .\" You and I should make this public .\" Twenty - four hours after they exposed the futures - market idea at a press conference , Total Information Awareness was dead .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"100.19812"}

{"text":"Muslims often claim that their religion only orders them to kill in self - defense ( ie .when their own lives are in danger ) .The Truth : .In fact , self - defense is just one of several conditions under which Muslims are permitted to take the lives of others .The myth of killing only in self - defense is easily disproved from the accounts of Muhammad 's own life as recorded in Islam 's sacred texts ( with which Muslim terrorists are only too familiar ) .Muhammad 's career of killing began with raids on merchant caravans traveling between Syria and Mecca .His men would usually sneak up on unsuspecting drivers and kill those who defended their goods .There was no self - defense involved here at all ( on the part of the Muslims , at least ) .This was old - fashioned armed robbery and murder - sanctioned by Allah ( according to Muhammad , who also demanded a fifth of the loot for himself ) .The very first battle that Muhammad fought was at Badr , when a Meccan army of 300 was sent out to protect the caravans from Muslim raids .The Meccans did not threaten Muhammad , and ( turning this Muslim myth on its ear ) only fought in self - defense after they were attacked by the Muslims .Following the battle , Muhammad established the practice of executing surrendered captives - something that would be repeated on many other occasions .The significance of this episode can hardly be overstated , because it lies at the very beginning of the long chain of Muslim violence that eventually passed right through the heart of America on September 11th .The early Muslims were not being threatened by those whom they attacked , and certainly not by those whom they had captured .They staged aggressive raids to eventually provoke war , just as al - Qaeda attempts to do in our time .Muslims try to justify Muhammad 's violence by claiming that he and his followers \" suffered persecution \" at the hands of the Meccans in an earlier episode , in which Muhammad was evicted from the city of Mecca and had to seek refuge at Medina .But even the worst of this persecution did not rise to the level of killing .Nor were Muhammad and his Muslims in any danger at all in their new home of Medina .They were free to get on with their lives .Even Muhammad 's own men evidently questioned whether they should be pursuing and killing people who did not pose a threat to them , since it seemed to contradict earlier , more passive teachings .To convince them , Muhammad passed along a timely revelation from Allah stating that \" the persecution of Muslims is worse than slaughter [ of non - Muslims ] \" ( Sura 2:191 ) .This verse established the tacit principle that the authority of Muslims is of higher value even than the very lives of others .There is no larger context of morality against which acts are judged .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"104.72681"}

Pryor 's 1988 note in the Yale Law Journal , The Natural - Born Citizen Clause and Presidential Eligibility : An Approach for Resolving Two Hundred Years of Uncertainty .The Supreme Court holds that the citizenship statutes are exclusive ; there is no residual common - law or natural - law citizenship .Citizens have no constitutional right to transmit their citizenship to children .In Rogers , the Supreme Court upheld a statute requiring children born overseas to citizen parents to reside in the United States to retain their citizenship .Since \" Congress may withhold citizenship from persons \" born overseas to citizen parents or \" deny [ them ] citizenship outright , \" it could impose the lesser burden of requiring U.S. residence to retain citizenship .Congressional power to withhold citizenship from children of U.S. citizens is not hypothetical ; for decades , it was law , and to some extent still is .Denial of automatic citizenship had very different implications than it would now because until the late nineteenth century , there was little federal immigration law .There were no general federal restrictions on who could enter the country , no provisions for deportation of residents who became undesirable , and immigration officials to deport them .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"105.55882"}

's lawyers deemed ThinThread too invasive of Americans ' privacy .In addition , concerns were raised about whether the system would function on a huge scale , although preliminary tests had suggested that it would .In the fall of 2000 , Hayden decided not to use ThinThread , largely because of his legal advisers ' concerns .Instead , he funded a rival approach , called Trailblazer , and he turned to private defense contractors to build it .Matthew Aid , the author of a heralded 2009 history of the agency , \" The Secret Sentry , \" says , \" The resistance to ThinThread was just standard bureaucratic politics .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"108.00772"}
