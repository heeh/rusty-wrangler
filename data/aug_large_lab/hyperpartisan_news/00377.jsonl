{"text":"If two - thirds of the sitting senators find the president guilty , he is removed from office .If Bill Clinton is removed , Vice - President Al Gore will automatically take over the presidency until elections in 2000 .How did it all start ?Strangely enough , not with Monica Lewinsky .Prosecutor Kenneth Starr was originally granted license to investigate the allegations that Clinton had broken the law in connection with the improper dealings of the Whitewater property company before he even became President .Monica Lewinsky gave evidence , denying any sexual relationship with the President , during the Paula Jones 's sexual - harassment lawsuit against him .Starr had picked up the possibility of Clinton committing or encouraging perjury over the Lewinsky affair in late 1997 .After Starr 's grand jury took evidence from both Lewinsky and Clinton , the Prosecutor published his report in September 1998 .A month later , the House Judiciary Committee voted to launch a congressional impeachment inquiry against Clinton .What is the House Judiciary Committee ?The House Judiciary Committee is one of over two hundred Congress committees currently in use .Because of the number of issues Congress has to deal with , committees are empowered to consider legislation , conduct hearings and investigations , and carry out other assignments as instructed by the chamber .The Judiciary Committee is one of Congress 's more important , permanent standing committees and it considers many other judicial issues apart from impeachment cases .But it will seldom attract as much attention as in the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton .The majority party holds a majority of the seats on every committee .Hence , the Judiciary Committee currently consists of 21 Republican congressmen and women and 15 Democrats .Its pro - Republican , anti - Clinton character is undisputed : chairman Henry Hyde sponsored an amendment banning the federal funding of abortions in the 1970s ; another Republican member , Bob Barr , attempted to impeach Clinton before the Lewinsky scandal broke .In impeachment cases , the judiciary committee 's role is to develop \" articles of impeachment \" ( charges ) against the President .The Senate then uses these in the final trial to decide whether the President is thrown from office .These charges stem from allegations surrounding the President that he denied the Lewinsky affair and tried to obstruct justice during the Paula Jones ' harassment case brought against him .An important precedent was set here by Walter Nixon , a Mississippi judge .He was the last US official to be impeached in 1989 , for lying to a grand jury trial over marijuana - smuggling .Republican Congressman Sensenbrenner believes this case could prove a decisive precedent .How might Clinton be cleared ?A person commits perjury in US law when they wilfully subscribes to any matter he does not believe to be true .Subornation of perjury is when a person induces another to commit perjury .It is very rare for perjury to be applied in civil cases , like the Paula Jones harassment case , because lawyers accept that lying is endemic .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"36.922363"}

H. Res .499 has been referred to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , as well as the Judiciary , International Relations , and Armed Services Committees .The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence was the first to act earlier today , albeit prematurely in my estimation .If we have learned anything from the war against terrorism , it is that our national security hinges upon human intelligence and the men and women who gather it .Before I introduced this resolution , I talked with a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and they told me I was doing the right thing .I wish all of them had been willing to stand up today for the men and women in the Intelligence Community who put their lives at risk to keep our nation safe .Congress , especially this Committee , has an oversight role .To say that Congress should not act because the Department of Justice , another agency , is investigating is like saying that if the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at wrongdoing at Enron , no Congressional inquiry is appropriate .I am severely disappointed at the lack of bipartisan cooperation on this Committee on a matter so fundamental to the national security of this country .I am disappointed that the Chairman did not even permit an open hearing to allow the public the ability to assess and judge for themselves our deliberations .This matter could have , and should have , been discussed without reference to any classified information .I must conclude that the hearing was closed to stifle debate , rather than to protect classified information .I am disappointed that he did not permit , at the least , opening statements to be on the public record .And I am disappointed that a majority of my colleagues voted yes on the motion to report H.

{"text":"The revelations that polygraph admissions sometimes do not lead to crime reports comes at a critical time for federal intelligence agencies , which are increasingly relying on lie detector tests to improve a porous government security clearance process .McCullough said that in several cases , officials and lawyers for the National Reconnaissance Office failed to notify federal , state or local law enforcement officials after polygraphs of employees disclosed potential crimes , from child molestation and computer viewing of child pornography to narcotics possession and use .McCullough 's office took up the review after a referral by Sen. Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , and a series of critical reports by McClatchy Newspapers in late 2012 .\" The intelligence community lacks specific policy or guidance on how potential crimes should be reported , \" McCullough said during a conference call Tuesday .He added that Clapper 's office responded by starting up \" a process for coordinating an intelligence community - wide crimes reporting policy .\" The inspector general reviewed the security files and lie detector tests from a sampling of nearly 300 employees of the NRO from 2009 to 2012 , McCullough said .His office found that the NRO , which operates the government 's spy satellites , had failed to report possible crimes from at least 3 percent of the personnel who were given polygraphs .McCullough 's review also found that lawyers in the agency 's general counsel 's office provided \" inaccurate and inconsistent advice \" to National Reconnaissance Office officials and others when lie detector tests found evidence of possible crimes .That advice , McCullough said , \" negatively affected the reporting of these potential crimes .\" The most glaring lapse discovered by the review was the NRO 's failure to promptly report possible non - federal crimes to local and state law enforcement authorities .McCullough blamed deficiencies in a 1995 government memo on crime reporting and the lack of authority in federal law to force agencies to report criminal admissions during lie tests .But the inspector general review found that federal law did not impede any disclosure by agency officials .Instead , McCullough said , some NRO lawyers simply did not urge disclosure despite their ability to do so .\" Absent a legal obligation , the NRO 's office of ( general counsel ) chose not to report non - federal crimes to the Department of Justice or law enforcement , in some cases when those crimes posed threats to others , \" McCullough said .McCullough 's office was drawn into the review after the NRO 's own inspector general 's office was recused because of what Grassley described as its own \" inadequate \" crime - reporting role .\" The NRO showed a complete lack of common sense in failing to require reporting of serious state crimes , \" Grassley said .He added that the agency had made improvements in crime reporting , but was still too slow in notifying proper law enforcement authorities .The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where truth and liberty flourish .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"78.071266"}
