{"text":"Any other thoughts on this ?I agree totally .Also , the idea that because \" it 's always been done and everybody does it \" as some sort of rationale for Dez to have carried the pads does n't make sense .Apply that logic to any historical event and where does that leave us ?Not talking about football , I can guaratee you that .More importantly , Williams is not even respected in his locker room and widely considered a bust ( fairly or unfairly ) .So why should Dez subject himself to such disrespect when he 's here to take Williams ' job as someone pointed earlier .Also consider that Williams is appearing on radio shows about \" pad - gate \" while Dez 's responses are \" I 'm here to compete and try to win a super bowl \" .Who seems more focused about the game ?Why is that going un - noticed ?Oh my yes .Bryant not doing what most every rookie goes through tells you everything about his character , as if you needed anymore inside information about it anyway , after the debacle that was his workout pro - day .He already sees himself above the situation .Jerry Jones and Cowboys fans are GOING TO HATE THIS DRAFT PICK !The difference between T.O. and Dex Bryant is work ethic , something Bryant already showed he had none of at his pro - day workout .Not to mention lying to the NCAA .Bryant has no character .Bryant has no work ethic .Bryant has no respect .Unless he goes through a Shark - Willie Beamon like confrontation sometime in the near future , this guy has no chance to be successful in Dallas .And to be honest , I ca n't wait .The Cowboys should 've moved up to draft Bryan Bulaga , cause they 're gon na need all the help they can get on the offensive line .From what I have seen and heard , this guy is totally focused on football and wants to win .To say he does n't have any character because he refused to carry some pads is a bit premature .We all know his upbringing and I would take a lot of players that come from a childhood like his because it typically breeds a great work ethic .These guys had a rough life and do n't want to live out their lives the same way .He may be rough around the edges right now , but he has his head on straight when it comes to football .You could be right in your assessment of his character , but let him make some real mistakes before we judge him on that .TAMPA , Fla. --Exactly a year ago , Antonio Bryant 's couch was among the world 's most uncomfortable seats .Week after week , that 's where Bryant sat , knowing he was better than most of the wide receivers he watched on television .The torture did n't come so much from the fact Bryant was n't allowed to play in the NFL as it did from the realization that he put himself in that situation .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"65.52507"}
