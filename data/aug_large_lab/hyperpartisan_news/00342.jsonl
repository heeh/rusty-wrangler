Jackson .For your convenience and mine I have reproduced the questions asked before providing my answers .Question : â€œA recent national poll reported that nearly 25 % of Americans want the government to pass more socialist legislation .No true American would answer that they agree with this proposed course of action .Likewise no student of history who can clearly see the past and present horrors that socialist government in any of its many forms has suffered upon the people would answer in the affirmative unless they are so blinded by a lust for power for themselves and control over others .The problem however becomes that I must ask the question what has the Republican Party done to stop the slowly creeping hand of unconstitutional state control over the years ?What has made them a better keeper of American liberty ?Is it merely the fact that they have not been party to as much bad socialist legislation as other political parties ?If such is the case , and it surely is , then it is not whether or not I agree but whether or not the Republican Party agrees and is willing to act against members who promote such folly .The question should not be which creates more jobs but which creates more liberty and sustainable employment .Both systems have proven capable of creating jobs .But is it good policy to pay one man to dig a hole and then another to simply fill it back up so that it may be dug again as many government make work projects do ?Is it good policy to build buildings that will see little use and simply to spend money as government is want to do ?Is it good policy to enact legislation that kills one job for an American worker but creates two bureaucratic posts to oversee the remaining ones as government policy often does ?Of course it is not .The American Free Enterprise System naturally creates jobs and does so by allowing individuals to freely enter into contracts with one another for goods and services .It allows them to partake of their liberty and is obviously and by far a better system despite at times that liberty leading to pain and suffering due to people making bad business decisions .Of course I prefer the latter to the inevitable pain doled out by government bureaucrats .Question : â€œThe Obama Administration has proposed spending as much as $ 1.5 trillion to bail out the banking industry .It is not just the Obama Administration that has proposed such .It has also been the Republican Partyâ€ ™ s representatives who have done such and actually helped pass bailouts of lenders who made bad financial decisions with their assets and acted poorly in their fiduciary responsibility to their customers who have invested with them .TARP is the glaring example of this .Of course such actions are extra - constitutional in scope and should not be undertaken .The problem is that neither major party has shown the ability to lead on such an issue .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"80.481125"}

{"text":"The GOP must correct its own house and get its message straight before it can grow the party .Question : \" What can the Republican Party do to earn your trust ?Sadly this is not a simple answer .The Republican Party has so much to do that trust can not be given easily .The party has betrayed American and our first principles so many times that it becomes a massive task in and of itself to just reach a point of modest trust much less competent action .A recurring theme is that many members of the Party are far too liberal and do far too much harm to America with their actions upon being elected to office .These folks should not be members of the Party and while it may be untenable to sever ties with these individuals due to a fear of loss in power and numbers within the current House and Senate we see that they can not be trusted anyway .Other members of the Party , Senator John McCain for example , have introduced blatant legislation within the chambers of Congress that directly opposes the Constitution and attempts to circumvent it .I speak of course of McCain - Feingold .There is absolutely no excuse for any man or woman representing the GOP to even think for a second that such was anything less than an unconstitutional infringement upon our God given liberties .Yet he and many others are allowed to remain in the Party 's good graces .And I do not believe that I need to even point out the heinousness of TARP which was supported by many members of the Republican Party and yet another clearly unconstitutional overreach .Far be it from me to imply that there should not be disagreements between members of the Party over issues .But when the issues in question are so clearly in violation of the federal Constitution yet still supported by Party members a serious look must be taken to see if they are worthy of being called Republicans .If not they should be thanked for their service and sent on their way to run either as Democrats , Independents or with some other third party that would accept their actions .The Republican Party must correct this to gain the trust of Americans who still believe in liberty and the Party must be willing to part company with those that do not in fact hold our Constitution and the principles of limited government most dear .The example most clear to me is that of the 2004 Senatorial elections involving Mr. Arlen Specter .The Republican Party disregarded a clearly superior candidate in terms of Republican ideals in Mr. Pat Toomey to openly support the incumbent .And today he has repaid that effort how ?I believe you see my obvious point .To be frank Mr. Steele , I am not so certain that you are indeed the man who can help achieve the goal of regaining either my trust or the trust of many other Americans which the GOP so desperately needs .You have not yet earned my trust and while I will gladly give you the opportunity to do so I remain skeptical .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"85.90294"}
{"text":"Americans deserve better .Or consider this example from Robert Sarvis , Virginia 's libertarian candidate for U.S. Senate : .In 2008 , when Republicans were the ones supporting the Export - Import Bank , candidate Barack Obama called it little more than corporate cronyism , but in 2014 , it was Democrats lining up to support it .Virginia 's Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine introduced the reauthorization bill , and President Obama signed it .Republicans are keeping the bank going until 2015 when they can figure out who is is in power , so they know which position to take .How anyone keeps falling for this shtick is beyond me .Spoilerism is a feature of third party voting , not a glitch .It communicates to mainstream politicians that we 're here , we vote , and if they want to beat their opponent , they need us to do it .The libertarian moment is nigh .Stay the course .Categories .On Gun Control , the Second Amendment , and the Future of the United States of America .The issue of gun control vs. gun freedom has been debated endlessly in the United States .This is a good thing , because it shows that civic participation is alive and well in this country , despite the best efforts of mainstream opinion arbiters who are always hard at work trying to force a generic , dispassionate consensus on everyone .The nature of the gun control / gun freedom debate basically centers around two questions : does the Second Amendment really protect the individual right to own a gun , and does private gun ownership actually make us safer or put us in greater danger ?The Second Amendment .The precise wording of the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights is as follows : . \" A well - regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed .Controversy over the real meaning of this Amendment has been stimulated by the first two sections , which would seem to indicate that the right to own a gun is contingent upon the need for a militia .The problem with this interpretation is that it completely ignores what the Founding Fathers meant with the second part of their conditional phrase , \" being necessary to the security of a free state .\" The reason why the Founders placed so much faith in the militia is because they had experienced repression at the hands of the British government 's standing army , and they did not want to risk having the same thing happen again .In other words , the Founders of the United States feared the possibility of a standing army being used against the people and against freedom , even if its alleged reason for existing was to protect the nation from outside invasion .Therefore , as an alternative to a standing army they preferred a militia , so the people would be able to protect themselves from tyranny and oppression no matter what the source .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"85.905235"}

Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats and Stephen Douglas of the Northern Democrats .I apologize if I was ambiguous .It was a national party dominated by Southern constituents , Southern candidates , slavery apologists ( in the north ) and Southern policies .The party became very effective at threatening that the south would secede if the north failed to vote for it .Stephen A. Douglas , for instance , though certainly not pro - slavery , was terrified by the thought of a southern secession , and bent over backwards to convince northerners to stop criticizing the institution .Yes , the Democratic Party split geographically along north - south lines , but that was incidental .The real split was between extreme , hostile pro - slavery attitudes and mere slavery acceptable .By 1860 , it was not enough to merely allow slavery to continue to exist in the South .Natural demographic and economic forces were shrinking and reducing the institution , so the Southern Democrats wanted proactive support from northerners and the federal government in protecting slavery from such forces .Stephen A. Douglas was viewed as too passive on the slavery matter , and so he was rejected as leader ( though he had been nominated legitimately - the slave states were quick to reject democratic results they did not like ) and the party split .Excellent , but one quibble , the legality of secession was considerably more vague than you let on .A bunch of northern states considered in during the war of 1812 , and the SC tried it before , as you say , during the nullification crisis .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"98.43611"}

{"text":"Election Postmortem - The Point Everybody is Missing [ Reader Post ] .By now everybody knows about the results of Tuesday 's elections and we 've seen tons of analysis .Did I miss anything ?It 's natural to knee jerk or overreact when something unexpected happens , so I have advice for both sides : do n't read too much into this election and base your next moves only on what happened Tuesday .First , for the Democrats , you were n't given a mandate .You scored some impressive wins on Tuesday , and for that I congratulate you .You kept the presidency in a hard fought campaign .You managed to gain seats in the Senate , including one popular figure from your side in Elizabeth Warren retaking Ted Kennedy 's old seat in Massachusetts .You got a referendum passed in Colorado legalizing pot , you got gay marriage ballot initiatives through in three states , and in California several measures to raise taxes and restrict economic freedom also went through .Combine this with President Obama 's 333 electoral votes and it looks like you 've got a clear mandate that the country is shifting leftward , right ?Not quite .When you look at the battleground states the president 's victory only came by roughly 350,000 votes .Yes , I now what the final margin in the overall popular vote was certainly more decisive , but keep in mind that the president also got nine million fewer votes than in 2008 .The Republicans gained seats in the House , and now has it 's largest margin among Governorships that either party has had in 12 years .Your California measures only made an already hostile business climate even worse by raising taxes and assuring that the unions will still be able to force union members to pay for their political campaigning .Expect more businesses to leave your state and unemployment to rise even more .And be careful with the gay marriage wins - your side seems to be even more prone to overreach than the right is .I 'm predicting you 'll jump the shark on this issue when someone decides to file a lawsuit against a church that refuses to perform a gay marriage .Sadly you 'll succeed in turning public opinion on this issue better than any conservative ever could .Now for the conservatives .Yes , the Romney campaign was not perfect .I 'm not even going to bother linking to any of the myriad of post game analysis articles on what went wrong .If you 're reading this post you 've probably read more than your share already .The day was n't a complete disaster for the GOP , as seen by my earlier mention of the House and Governorships .Of course , the presidency was the big prize and the failure to defeat such an incompetent president is painful to say the least .While I 've seen no shortage of reasons for Romney 's loss to Obama , nobody has seen the most obvious reason that Romney failed - there is simply no way he could have beaten Obama .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"101.67806"}

{"text":"But coming back to the coverage , the report also says that Democratic congressman Rahm Emanuel knew one year ago about Foley 's problems and took no action .Emanuel says he had only cursory knowledge .BILL PRESS SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO :You know , I do n't know about the Rahm Emanuel thing .I do n't know the facts of Rahm Emanuel .But my feeling is , anybody who knew about it should have gone to the Ethics Committee or should have gone to the police and reported this activity .But I must say , if Rahm Emanuel had done that a year ago , you know what ?People would have -- Republican leaders would have accused him of just playing politics and they would n't have done anything anyhow .This is a Republican problem .KURTZ : And Republican leaders said at the time that Democrats were responsible for peddling this story .So , Rachel Maddow [ Air America Radio ] , it does seem like Democrats were trying to get this out for partisan reasons rather than going to authorities .Maybe more surprising , although George Stephanopoulos did discuss the House report with This Week 's panel members on Sunday , there was no mention of Emanuel , Miller , or the possibilty the Congressman from Illinois had lied back in October .I guess Stephanopoulos does n't mind being lied to when the person committing it is a fellow Democrat .In the end , political observers likely wo n't be shocked by any of this .As the Media Research Center 's Brent Bozell wrote days after the recent elections : .In 25 years of looking at the national media , I have never seen a more one - sided , distorted , vicious presentation of news -- and non - news -- by the national media .They ought to be collectively ashamed .They have made a mockery out of the term \" objective journalism \" and a laughingstock of themselves at the idea that they should be considered objective journalists .Without question , Bozell was 100 percent correct : the media in this country likely never had such a disgraceful hand in getting so many people elected as they did in 2006 .Maybe even more reprehensibly , if they had put a tenth of the energy into finding out who leaked this story as they did on the non - event that was the Valerie Plame Wilson affair , maybe the election results would have been different .Of course , much as George Stephanopoulos is n't concerned when Democrats lie to him on national television , the press are only interested in uncovering the source of leaks when it benefits Democrats .If you thought for a moment this was going to change once the elections ended , think again .Noel Sheppard is a frequent contributor to American Thinker .He is also contributing editor for the Media Research Center 's NewsBusters.org , and a contributing writer to its Business & Media Institute .Noel welcomes feedback .

{"text":"The Tea PArty is deliberately NOT running a third party because they are simply aligning themselves with Republicans .The Republicans , in the last decade , have been totally anti - conservative in tea party terms .We are not running as a third party because we hope the Republicans can be returned to their historic roots vis - a - vis conservatism .This is the reason the primaries are so important this year .In my home state of Indiana , the good ol' boy Republican machine has brought in a carpetbagger in the person of Dan Coats , who is just about as establishment as people get .Conservatives do n't like him because he 's a lobbyist and a Bush - era Republican .We have several good conservative candidates in the primaries and we 're working to get one of them nominated .That said , if Coats wins the primary I 'll probably vote for him .Not because I like Coats , but because I despise Brad Ellsworth , the Democrat .There are LOTS of us who learned some important lessons about third parties from the Perot campaign .Some spending can not be cut , entitelment programs are the first thing on the budget list and it 's not going away , same with medicare and so on .Those alone can not be cut and take a HUGE portion of our budget .Which non - entitelment expenditures do conservatives support cutting ?How much money could be saved ?Cutting taxes , another thread showed that the middle class already pays little to no taxes , especially now that Obama implimented tax cuts .Remember that a good portion of the stimulus package was tax cuts , why were conservatives opposed to those ?Cutting tax on the rich ? as many point out , they contribute the lion 's share of government revenue , is it a good idea to cut these taxes ?If we cut the governments revenue , and entitelement programs can not be cut and defense is never cut , what on Earth could we cut to get back to deficit neutral ?There are other factors in place too , our economy has restructured .We are no longer a manufactoring economy and computers and the internet are totally changing how the service sector operates .The old rules may not apply anymore when the economic landscape is different .Just how rules about the economy changed after the industrial revolution , just how rules about the economy changed after the great depression , the information revolution is also changing the landscape and rules of the economy .It seems the main goal behind voting Republican is to remove the Democrats who voted for Obama 's policies .Many of these democrats are comfortably safe in their districts , where their constituents agree with their votes .Other democrats are now retiring .THIS IS NOT ABOUT PARTY !- this is what the tea party always says .If the Dems who voted for health care are retiring , then a vote for a Republican is no longer a vote to kick out that Democrat .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"115.18683"}
{"text":"Absent this shakedown of potential car buyers , Tesla would have lost $ 57 million , or $ 11,400 per car .As the company sold 5,000 cars in the quarter , though , $ 13,600 per car was paid by other manufacturers , who are going to pass at least some of that cost on to buyers of their products .Folks in the new car market are likely paying a bit more than simply the direct tax subsidy .Slate 's Scott Woolley details another way in which Tesla has cost taxpayers money .In 2009 , Tesla received a $ 465 million Department of Energy loan that allowed it to weather a financial maelstrom .Unlike Solyndra ( and Abound Solar and Fisker Automotive and The Vehicle Production Group LLC ) , Tesla managed to repay the loan in 2013 .But Tesla paid the U.S. taxpayers back at a rate far below what venture capitalists would have earned on the same loan .As an example , Tesla 's CEO Elon Musk also made a loan to Tesla .Musk got a 10 % interest rate and options to convert the debt to stock , which he did , resulting in a 3,500 % rate of return on his investment .In contrast , the U.S. taxpayer received a 2.6 % rate of return .In other words , in our crony capitalist system , taxpayers take the loss on bad loans like the one to Solyndra , but do not enjoy commensurate reward on good loans like the one to Tesla .But there is still more .Tesla can not keep earning emissions credits , which allow it to earn a profit despite selling its cars at a loss , unless it can keep selling those cars .Josh Harkinson , writing for Mother Jones , writes that : .Its first - quarter profit , a modest $ 11 million , hinged on the $ 68 million it earned selling clean - air credits under a California program that requires automakers to either produce a given number of zero - emission vehicles or satisfy the mandate in some other way .Tesla 's ability to continue selling the cars that earn the credits is in question .The market for $ 80,000 cars has a limited number of buyers .Tesla must expand its customer base with a more affordable product .One way to achieve that would be to cut the vehicle 's range .But subsidies , credits and fuel savings notwithstanding , consumers have little taste for lower ranges - even at a much lower price .Another way for Tesla to lower the cost of its vehicles is to cut the cost of its batteries without sacrificing the range .As Harkinson observes : .That , however , may again depend on massive subsidies - in this case funding to battery researchers and manufacturers by the governments of Japan and China .Over the past five years , Japan 's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization , a public - private partnership founded in 1980 , has pumped roughly $ 400 million into developing advanced battery technologies .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"115.235504"}

Bush urging him to issue a press release that it was a gift to Putin .He was then instructed by Bush to drop the issue .As most of you may recall , the 2004 - 2005 season was in the midst of a run of seasons in which the Patriots were found to be taping other teams practices and stealing their signals .In my opinion , Kraft is complaining about the theft of something that was already stolen .Karma really is a bitch Mr. Kraft .By the way , why were you meeting with Mr Putin ?Was he giving you tips on how to steal information in a more discreet manner ?The memos regarding the targeting of Americans suspected of being members of Al - Qaida are not only disturbing , they 're down right ass puckering .The White House is insisting that Obama has the right to play judge , jury , and executioner in these cases .Our right to due process is of no consequence .It 's bad enough that we utilize flying killer robots to kill innocents in other countries : now , Obama is insisting that he can turn them on us with absolutely no disclosure of proof , no arrest , no trial , no anything .All it takes is whatever file our crack intelligence agencies happen to lay on Obama 's desk .The drone program is n't a war on terror , it 's a war on liberty , it 's a war on human rights .The drone program is the resurgence of Murder Incorporated .The drone program is n't justice , it 's White House directed vigilantism , it 's fascism disguised as the war on terror .What 's nearly as disturbing as this total lack of regard for our right of due process , is the lack of protest from our media , or seemingly any liberal for that matter .We should be as outraged over this as we were over the transgressions perpetrated by the Bush Administration .When will this country have a government that actually works for and with the people ?What we have , and have had all along , is a government that works above the people .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"118.92159"}
