{"text":"Similar to Article 50 the accession clause in Lisbon - Article 49 -also does not mention specifically the need for a new Treaty .Yet if a country applies to join the EU a new treaty is ultimately required for precisely the same reasons as leaving - that it requires amendments to the founding treaties .A recent example is the Treaty of Accession 2011 concerning Croatia 's accession to the EU which comes into force 1stJuly 2013 .Under Article 49 a country formally applies for membership , then begins a period of negotiation mainly based on whether the country wishing to apply is able to sufficiently execute EU law .This process would be remarkably similar to Article 50 but obviously for opposite intentions .The UK would formally notify intentions to leave , negotiate , and then sign the resulting treaty which is ratified by the EU and all Member States .Those countries wishing to join the EU have the option of saying no by changing their minds if the terms are n't right , those countries wishing to leave have the option of saying no by not accepting the withdrawal agreement if the terms are n't right .One quirk with Article 50 though is as a member of the EU - the European Council and the Council of the EU - the UK would ending up sitting on both sides of the negotiating table regarding the new treaty .So this is where Article 50 ( 4 ) comes in ( my emphasis ) : .For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3 , the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it .This is entirely logical otherwise the UK would end up negotiating with itself .This exclusion is entirely consistent to Article 49 where accession countries are also absent from the European Council and the Council ... by virtue of not yet being EU members .In summary Article 50 allows us to fulfill our international obligations , abide by our EU treaty agreements and allows for an orderly exit with minimum of disruption particularly with regarding trade .40 responses to \" Article 50 And Withdrawal \" .I disagree .Article 50 is a trap .Let me go back to the beginning ; I always bristle when people talk of Britain 's ' relationship ' with the EU , as though the EU were something ' over there ' external from the UK .That might have been the case prior to Lisbon , when the former European Union to which we belonged was merely an agreement between sovereign nations .But the Lisbon Treaty has created a nenw country called Europe , of which we are a mere province .We no more have a ' relationship ' with the EU than Ohio has a relationship with the USA .The reason there was no ' exit clause ' in the ' old ' EU was that it was not necessary .We could , as a sovereign partner , simply have repealed the 1972 European Communities Act , by which we acceded to the Treaty of Rome , and with one bound we would have been free .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"53.158546"}
{"text":"He would probably be replaced by a more eurosceptic leader who might actively campaign to pull Britain out of the EU .The final reason why Scoxit might lead to Brexit is linked to Cameron 's strategy of renegotiating Britain 's relationship with the EU before holding an In / Out referendum .He hopes to use the concessions he has won as a strong reason for voting to stay in .The problem is that , if Scotland votes for independence , there will then be a messy argument over the divorce terms .Brussels will also need to negotiate the terms of Scotland 's admission to the EU , which wo n't be easy either .Will both London and Brussels be able to focus on renegotiating their own relationship when they are tied up bargaining with Edinburgh ?There has to be a risk that they wo n't and that , therefore , Cameron 's strategy of going to the electorate with a new deal on Europe in 2017 will be in tatters .That , in turn , would make it harder for the \" in \" campaign to win a referendum .In other words , Salmond may be as big a risk to Britain 's EU membership as Farage .That Labour governments in the UK depend on Scotland being a part of the Union is purely myth and it is a myth that a supposedly responsible news organisation has NO business repeating as though it were true .Only three times have Scottish in the past have MPs made any difference in the outcome of a British General Election .Other than that your reference to Scoxit and Brexit are silly , your basic premise is deeply , deeply flawed .And for that matter if the people of Scotland want to withdraw from the UK , it is their right and their business .The same must be said about the UK withdrawing from the EU and proposing that Scotland should prevent EWNI from expressing their democratic will is appalling .As an American , I do n't really have a right to an opinion on either Scottish independence or Brexit , but it 's difficult to avoid having questions when hearing about these things .First , I really do n't understand how Scotland could become better off by leaving Great Britain .I saw clips of a recent speech by Alex Salmond in which he was summing up his case for Scottish independence , and it all appeared based on emotion and nostalgia rather than practical considerations .I confess that I , too , prefer Robert Burns to William Wordsworth , but I do n't see how that kind of preference should affect important political and economic decisions .As for Brexit , it 's easy to see why some Brits are seeing EU membership as a pair of lead boots .But it sure sounds like David Cameron 's approach to the problem is very practical .On one hand , he 's telling Europe that Britain may have to leave the EU if they ca n't fix the Britain - Europe relationship .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"53.778076"}

{"text":"We also asked for an examination of how the UK might fit into the fresh geopolitical and economic landscape that would follow .Forty years ago , Labour prime minister Harold Wilson made a manifesto pledge for a referendum on whether to remain in the EEC .This was held in June 1975 - the last time the British people had a say on their relationship with what has now become the European Union .In the 2005 general election , all three major parties promised a referendum on whether to ratify the EU Constitution , yet no referendum has since been forthcoming .Voters could therefore be forgiven for being cynical when promised they will be asked for their views at some date in the future .But there is a head of steam building up that will become difficult to resist .Democracy is the space within which the people express their will .And , on Europe , voters want their say , not just in European elections , but also on the nature of the relationship itself .Yet if you ask people for their views on \" in \" or \" out \" , you owe it to them to provide choices as to what that will mean .Polls show that the majority of the British public favour a reformed EU over exit or maintaining the status quo .But , as yet , we are unclear what these mean in practice and what the consequences of a particular choice would be in reality .Even if the British government were n't to do anything from here , the rest of the EU knows it has to make significant institutional changes to deal with the fallout from its unstable currency .The EU member states will divide into those who are in the euro , those who are not yet in the euro and those who have no intention of joining the euro .Likewise , if doing nothing still means change , then pulling out does not mean simply rewinding the clocks to 1973 .The Brexit Prize is therefore an important first step towards bringing some light to the debate .This is quite a task .It involves the sheer complexities of negotiations within the EU as well as the unpredictability of the political environment in which this will take place .But Iain Mansfield 's winning entry assesses these issues in detail , arguing that the most important consideration in renegotiation would be to ensure the maintenance of zero tariffs on trade between the UK and the EU in all areas apart from agriculture .Mr Mansfield suggests UK membership of the European Free Trade Area , while remaining outside the European Economic Area , and hence giving us the ability to repeal significant amounts of single - market regulation .This would see us somewhere between the positions of Switzerland and Turkey .Equally important , though , is to map out what Britain 's place in the world would be .There 's much more detail on the reforms necessary to UK government , the sticking points we are likely to encounter , the regulations we could abolish and the risks we face .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"53.894474"}

{"text":"However Cameron 's strategy essentially involves putting his \" renegotiated settlement \" up against a concept which is so vague as to be meaningless .Until we define exactly what leaving the EU entails , it 's impossible for a referendum to give any clear indication of what the British public actually want from their relationship with Europe .Cameron 's speech might be a game changer for the Scottish independence campaign .Arno van der Zwet - University of Strathclyde .The speech has the potential to change the relationship between London and Brussels , but does it also have an impact on relations between London and Edinburgh ?Of course , a speech of this magnitude brings many opportunities for political quipping , but to what extent will the ' No Camp ' and ' Yes Camp ' in the Scottish independence campaign be affected by the speech ?For those campaigning for a ' no ' vote in the Scottish independence referendum , Cameron 's speech brings some profound difficulties .First , the No Camp , including Cameron , has long argued that the SNP should have called a quick referendum when it won an unexpected outright majority in the Scottish Parliament in 2011 .This would have avoided unnecessary political and economic uncertainty .The five year run up period for a European in / out referendum will lead to similar accusations and therefore inconsistencies on the part of the No Camp .Second , one key argument of the No Camp has been that Scottish independence equates with a form of narrow nationalism and isolationism ( its slogan is ' Better Together ' ) .This will be difficult to maintain when the British position in Europe appears so antagonistic .Third , The Conservatives are a marginal force in Scottish Politics and it really is the Labour Party that leads the No Camp .In many ways they have been saddled with a problem that is not of their own making .Cameron 's position will emphasise the disunity within the camp ; not so much on the preservation of British Union but on what the position of that Union in the world will be .The Scottish National Party ( SNP ) is the main face of the Yes Camp .It adopted its ' Independence in Europe ' strategy in the early 1990s , but the sound - bite has been less popular in recent years .Part of this has to do with the natural ageing process of slogans and mantras , but there are other factors that have made talking about Europe difficult .First , despite some signs that the rescue operation of the eurozone may have been successful , the eurocrisis lies fresh in the electorate 's memory .Talk of being in the EU is tainted and the argument that the EU can provide security and continuity for an independent Scotland has perhaps become less convincing .Second , the Scottish electorate is no more pro - Europe ( or equally Eurosceptic ) than their neighbours south of the border : in the 1975 referendum , 10 per cent fewer Scots voted for membership than did so in England .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"58.599625"}

{"text":"Lisbon treaty text by Article : Article 50 TEU ( withdrawal ) .It is sometimes said by EU supporters that EU sceptics should vote for Lisbon because it is the first EU treaty to include a specific provision on withdrawal .This is a highly disingenuous .International treaties ( like those on European Union ) may be divided into those ( like Lisbon ) which include provisions on a party withdrawing and those ( like Rome through Nice ) which have no such provision .But the lack of such a provision does not mean that withdrawal is impossible .Article 56(1 ) of the Vienna Convention on the Law on Treaties states : .Article 56(1 ) of the Vienna Convention on the Law on Treaties ( applies now under Nice ) 1 .A leading text on the law of treaties says ' the constituent instrument of an international organisation ... almost certainly falls within paragraph ( b ) ' .In other words a signatory state is free to leave an international organization even if the treaty setting up that organisation has no specific provision on withdrawal .What Lisbon does do ( in Article 50 TEU ) is include such a specific provision on withdrawal .because of that Article 54 of the Vienna Convention on the Law on Treaties would apply should Lisbon come into force .It states : .So the change in Lisbon on withdrawal is not to grant a right of withdrawal but to set out ( in Article 50 TEU ) the procedure to be followed should any state want to leave at some point in the future , for reasons yet unseen .The question then arises as to whether this procedure is more onerous than that implied by Article 56(1 ) of the Vienna law of treaties quoted above that allows it to leave unilaterally today .The claims of EU supporters that EU - skeptics should vote for Lisbon on the grounds that they are locked into the EU now without Lisbon is false .It is a rather obvious ruse and a dangerous one .There is the question of what would happen should a subsequent EU treaty ( or the Lisbon self - amending ' ordinary revision procedure ' ) be used to change Article 50 TEU in a way that would make it harder ( or perhaps impossible ) for a state to leave ?Then a state really might find that it was locked in .------------Article 50 TEU 1 .Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements .A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention .In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council , the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State , setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal , taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union .That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union .It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council , acting by a qualified majority , after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"60.812744"}

{"text":"The Tories will , of course , hope to win votes from Labour by arguing that it is denying the voters a choice .But such a strategy could backfire if the electorate thinks the Conservatives are obsessed with an issue that is n't their priority .What 's more , those voters who are really keen on quitting the EU may well vote for the real thing , UKIP , rather than its imitation .Meanwhile , Labour is now aligned on the question of an In / Out vote with the Liberal Democrats , Cameron 's coalition partners .For Cameron to push through his referendum plans , he will have to win an overall majority at the next election .At the moment , Labour has a slim lead in the opinion polls .The gap might close as next year 's election approaches , since the UK economy is recovering .But even if the Tories gain the most votes , they may not win the most seats given that the electoral system favours Labour .And even if they win the most seats , it would be surprising if they won an overall majority .Brexit is n't totally off the table .Quite apart from the possibility of a clean win for Cameron in 2015 followed by the loss of a referendum , two other scenarios would see Britain quit the EU .First , if Scotland votes to leave the UK in its referendum in September , it would lose its MPs in a couple of years ' time .Given that Labour has 41 MPs north of the border while the Tories have only one , a Scottish Out vote would have knock - on effects in Westminster : even if Miliband won the 2015 election , he might be kicked out of office soon after .In such a scenario , an incoming Tory prime minister might well be more eurosceptic than Cameron and might press ahead with an In / Out referendum on the EU .There would be a double blow because the Scots , who tend to be pro - EU , would n't take part in that vote .Second , even if there is no In / Out EU referendum before 2020 , the issue wo n't go away .When and if the Conservatives get back into power , they will probably put it back on the table .That said , for the time being , the risks of Brexit have fallen .\" Holding referendums is only democratic when a big constitutional change is under discussion or when the people demand one . \"Huh ?A referendum seems like a pure expression of democracy in its original Athenian sense of government conducted through direct voting by an assembly of all of the people .Perhaps what is meant is that a referendum may not be republican , in the original Roman sense of government conducted indirectly by the people , through their elected representatives .Is n't a referendum the ultimate in retail democracy ?And are n't the decisions made by political partisans engaged in wholesale democracy , catering to a narrow group of people whose financial and institutional support is necessary for the survival of the career politician ?","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"63.19792"}

{"text":"But a vote for Scottish independence would change all that .And here the polls are moving in the opposite direction .Until a year ago , the idea that Scotland would quit the UK seemed a remote possibility .But in one ICM poll last month , 42 percent of those quizzed said they wanted to stay in the UK versus 39 percent who wanted to quit .Alex Salmond , the Scottish nationalist leader , is running an effective populist campaign .The odds from betting house William Hill currently imply a 30 percent chance of a \" Scoxit \" - Scotland 's exit from the UK .Such a scenario would increase the chances of a Brexit for four reasons .First , the Scots are more pro - EU than the other Brits .If there is a referendum on Britain 's EU membership in 2017 , as Prime Minister David Cameron has promised , the Scots wo n't vote and it will therefore be a little harder to persuade the rest of the UK to stay in .The absence of Scotland might deprive the \" in \" campaign of 2 - 3 percentage points of \" net \" pro - EU votes .That could be decisive in a tight race .Second , the chances that Britain will hold a referendum will shoot up because it will be more likely that there will be a Conservative government in 2017 .At present , the Labour opposition has 41 members of parliament ( MPs ) from Scotland while the Tories have only one .The UK has 650 MPs in total .If the Scottish MPs were excluded , it would be harder for Labour ( which has pretty much said it wo n't call an EU referendum ) to run the country .This does n't mean Cameron will necessarily win the next general election in May 2015 , because the Scots will still get to vote even if they back independence this September .It will take at least until March 2016 for Scottish independence to become effective .Ed Miliband , the Labour leader , might well become prime minister in 2015 .The snag is that , once Scottish independence does become effective , Scotland would lose its MPs in Britain , and Miliband , if he was prime minister , would probably lose his majority .Either there would then be a new general election , which Miliband would probably lose , or Miliband would immediately be replaced by a Tory prime minister , who would then call a referendum on EU membership .That new Conservative prime minister almost certainly would n't be Cameron .If he had lost both Scotland and a general election in quick succession , he could n't stay as leader .In fact , he might even be kicked out before next year 's general election if the Scots vote for independence , such would be the blow to national pride .The possibility that a Scoxit vote could lead to a new Tory leader is the third reason why it would increase the chances of a Brexit .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"64.02298"}

{"text":"Who wrote it ?So I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to my readers who may be labouring under the impression that this blog is Eurosceptic .A small number of readers would have already been aware of the deception of course , donning special ' truth sunglasses ' akin to those in the film They Live , which reveal the pro - EU subliminal messages that permeate this blog .So in the style of Scooby Doo , it looks as if I have finally been unmasked .I beg forgiviness for the lie .Not so long ago , it seemed unlikely that any country politically was willing to contemplate leaving the European Union .Nothing illustrates this better than the fact that all of the treaties pre - Lisbon were silent on the question of withdrawal .A treaty which contains no provision regarding its termination and which does not provide for denunciation or withdrawal is not subject to denunciation or withdrawal unless : . a ) it is established that the parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation or withdrawal ; or .b ) a right of denunciation or withdrawal may be implied by the nature of the treaty .Interestingly , and perhaps ironically , these provisions of the Vienna Treaty did not cover EEC / EU Treaties before Lisbon .The spirit and terms of those treaties as epitomised by \" ever closer union \" , with the long - term goal of full political and economic integration , meant the \" right of denunciation or withdrawal \" was never implied .Quite the opposite in fact .Thus it could 've been argued therefore that exit of the EU was not specifically allowed under international law .Crucially this was reinforced , by virtue of its absence as a clause , that the Vienna Treaty also does not list sovereignty as a means of automatically absolving countries from their treaty obligations .There is no legal defence within the Vienna Treaty for a country who wishes to withdraw unilaterally from its obligations as it sees fit .This became especially true due to the nature of EEC / EU Treaties .The European Court of Justice has a well - established interpretation that EU treaties are permanently binding on the Member States and limit their sovereign rights as per Flaminio Costa v ENEL [1964 ] ECR 585 ( 6/64 ) - ( my emphasis ) : .However the problems and arguments with Article 56(1 ) , and pre - Lisbon , are now largely moot points , as the Lisbon Treaty explicitly makes provision for the voluntary secession of a Member State from the EU and this provision comes via Article 50 .Therefore exit from the Lisbon Treaty , and subsequently from the EU , is instead covered by Article 54 of the Vienna Convention on the Law on Treaties ( my emphasis ) : .The termination of a treaty or the withdrawal of a party may take place : .( a ) in conformity with the provisions of the treaty ; or .( b ) at any time by consent of all the parties after consultation with the other contracting States .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"70.26007"}

{"text":"So launching a fundamentally flawed currency in those circumstances is folly on sticks .This poll merely demonstrates once again that the concept of the EU is built on sand , and when it starts to all go wrong it has no where left to go .It 's with a little amusement , considering my last post , I stumble upon this from CORDIS ( Community Research and Development Information Service ) courtesy of the EU Commission : .Liar , liar nose on fire .European researchers have made a major advance in thermal imaging techniques that is bringing to life an old fable .Everyone is familiar with the children 's story of Pinocchio , a wooden puppet , with a nose that grew every time he told a lie .Now researchers from Spain are seeing parts of this tale ring true .The researchers from the University of Granada , Department of Experimental Psychology have discovered that when a person lies he or she experiences what they have termed a ' Pinocchio effect ' .During the Pinocchio effect the subject may experience an increase in the temperature around their nose and in the orbital muscle in the inner corner of their eyes .In addition to this , the researchers discovered that when people perform a considerable mental effort , temperature around the face drops , and when we have an anxiety attack our face temperature rises .These are some of the conclusions that were arrived at in their pioneering study and as a result of their new applications in the field of thermography .But more importantly what would Cameron or Health look like using thermal imaging techniques , one wonders whether it would need significant recalibration just to register an image , given that it would otherwise go off the scale .That such an unnecessary and irrational project as building a European super - state was ever embarked on will seem in future years to be perhaps the greatest folly of the modern era .And that Britain . . .should ever have become part of it will appear a political error of the first magnitude . 'Lady Thatcher .Sadly among the New Year celebrations , we must note that today is 40th anniversary of one of the biggest mistakes this country has ever made in its history - entry to what was then the EEC ( euphemistically called a Common Market ) .The EEC was nothing but a staging post onto the final goal of full political and economic union .Britain was joining a project that was designed to eradicate democracy and sovereignty .Despite Heath 's assertions that , \" there is no question of Britain losing essential national sovereignty \" , the politicians at the time , particularly Heath , were well aware this was not true and kept the true nature of the project hidden from the British public .And so began the underlying characteristic of our membership - monumental deceit ; lied to on entry , lied to during membership and lied to about the nature of exit .Thankfully though there seems to be light ahead , as there now appears a significant shift in the mood music if not momentum .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"115.81727"}
{"text":"However , this frenetic pace of hunting quickly diminished the number of monkeys in the forest and the villagers per force had to stop this activity .Looking at the diminished supply , the businessman announced that he would now buy monkeys at $ 20 .This prompted the villagers to make a renewed effort and they now ventured still deeper into the forest to catch the beasts .Once again , however , the supply diminished and the villagers lost interest , returning to their farms for a living .But then the businessman increased the offer to $ 25 each .This sparked off enthusiasm in the villagers yet again .However , the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey , let alone catch it !The businessman now announced that he would buy monkeys at $ 50 !The offer lured each and every villager .However , in between , the businessman had to go to the city on some business visit and his assistant started to look after the business on behalf of him .In the meantime the villagers had befriended the assistant as they considered him one of them .In the absence of the businessman , the assistant told the villagers : \" Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected .I will sell them to you at Rs 35 and when the man returns from the city , you can sell them to him for Rs 50 each .The villagers rounded up all their savings and bought all the monkeys .But when they visited the businessman 's place , there was no sign of the businessman or the assistant .There were only monkeys everywhere ! \"Mr Anonymous Mind , sorry Autonomous Mind , I can understand why you think I am nuts .The big problem with the EU has always been one of credulity .When you tell people what is happening they just do n't believe it .All I can say in my defence is that I may be paranoid , but that does n't mean they 're not out to get me !Some got three , the somme , Ireland , and the luftwaffer , my great grandfathers being the tougest , in the four legged cavalry , seen some of the photographs from the fields of france , \" Rather Them Than Me \" .My grandfather also worked on the spits as well as the bombers , he went on raids over germany as an observer .No member state has ever held a national referendum on withdrawal from the European Union , though in 1975 the United Kingdom held a national referendum on withdrawal from its predecessor , the EEC ; 67.2 % of voters chose to remain in the Community .The United Kingdom has legislated for a referendum to be held before the end of 2017 on whether to remain a member of , or leave , the European Union .The Treaty of Lisbon introduced an exit clause for members who wish to withdraw from the Union .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"121.66946"}
