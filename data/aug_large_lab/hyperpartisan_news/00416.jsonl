John McCain , but some Hispanics have become disillusioned with Obama because of his failure to deliver on promises to overhaul immigration policy .Obama , who visited as a candidate in May 2008 , sought to assure his Puerto Rican listeners they were not forgotten by his administration .In remarks at an arrival event at the airport in San Juan , Obama quickly turned to the decades - old debate about the island 's status , which has some pushing for statehood or even independence .The president reaffirmed his support for a referendum in which island voters would resolve the matter for themselves , eliciting cheers when he said : \" When the people of Puerto Rico make a clear decision , my administration will stand by you .\" The words could resonate not just here but with the millions of Puerto Rican voters on the mainland , including more than 800,000 in politically important Florida , where Obama stayed overnight Monday before flying here Tuesday morning .Democrats see the Puerto Ricans in Florida as a potential counterbalance to the larger , traditionally Republican Cuban - American community in a state Obama needs to win a second term .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"46.73799"}

{"text":"This tale will touch on the vastness of the celestial canvas known as The Doughnut .Per chance , we may even travel into the depths of this vast universe .And , per chance , we may return .Dreaming is believing a wise man once said , and if the population of The Doughnut knew how close to home this pretty phase struck , rioting would ensue .Of course this is assuming the riots had first been dreamt !But once again we go delving into the recesses of philosophical questioning , and its dark down there !Thus a retreat to sturdier ground is in order .So back to the planet .The planet in question was known as Barrow , named after its chief export , Wheelbarrows .Wheelbarrows made lucrative business in these parts , and none took more advantage of this than the Dwarfs that made then .The expectedly crafted barrows they would keep for them selves to aid in the prospecting of deeper mines .But everything else was sold .The good barrows , the bad , and sometimes even the downright shoddy .The buyers ?The Humans !Those same Humans which moved here from somewhere ?Everywhere was assumed .They just seemed to turn up .Then the Dwarfs would sell them a barrow , and everybody would be happy .Gold for barrows , a good deal to anyone .Especially Dwarfs , as to be expected .Sometimes though a Human would find themselves working in the barrow business , and would find it quite lucrative , if played right .Maybe they could get some Dwarfs working for them ? maybe fellow Humans too .Paid well of course , housing , dental , free travel , even off world and that was very rare .So Humans would come to the planet of Barrow and work for the Barrowmen .But of course they would all need a barrow , sometimes maybe even two .Most Humans needed them here .Things were heavy !Gravity was ...Unkind !At least to non Dwarf folk .Dwarfs as to be expected , ran and skipped around freely .One of the privileges of being from a place is that usually you 're used to the gravity of said place !Ten points to evolution .Evolution however can never quite prepare you for the politics of interstellar visitors , thus the Dwarves would never get used to Humans .So took pleasure in frolicking and dancing whenever they got the chance in front of them .This general air of glee was not normal behaviour for a Dwarf it must be stressed .Most preferred to take life at a slower more manageable pace , but occasionally rubbing salt into the wound of a species the Dwarves do say , . \"Are asking for it ! \" Is a much needed way to blow off steam .But to the Humans , and lets face it , pretty much every other species , this just looked like a thing Dwarfs did to have fun .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"134.28976"}
