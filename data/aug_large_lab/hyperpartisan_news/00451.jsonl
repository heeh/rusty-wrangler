{"text":"To do any less - to discriminate in care giving - would be shameful , she says .Michael Allen , 64 , used to be a construction worker .When he showed up at the Voice Homeless Shelter a few weeks ago , he was in rough shape .He 'd been discharged from a local emergency room despite his having a smashed collarbone with a visible separation wide enough to poke a finger through .Worse , though , was Allen 's abdominal hernia : A tear in the muscle wall above his waist had opened so far that his intestines were seeping through it .A slender , quiet man , Allen lifted his shirt for a recent visitor to show how bad the condition had become .Where normally there might be a thin layer of tissue or fat , his digestive tract bulged out , moving and burbling as he digested his breakfast .When he sat , he winced uncomfortably .He said he had already been to a local hospital , where doctors told him they could not operate on his hernia because it was n't an emergency .\" They told me it was n't serious enough yet .They would n't help me .They gave me some food , but they were n't nice at all . \" Hernias such as Allen 's typically are deemed emergencies when the distended intestines become strangulated , which in turn can cause a gangrenous bowel , or when the hernia becomes septic , which can be fatal .\" They told me to come back when it got worse , \" Allen said .But \" when this gets worse , I 'll be dead . \"Another man at the Voice Homeless Shelter said he was discharged from a local hospital with an abscess on his buttocks that was cleaned but not swabbed or cultured to determine whether MRSA was present .New protocols from the Centers for Disease Control require doctors to test all infected wounds for MRSA , which resists all but a few strong antibiotics .Left untreated , MRSA can rapidly eat through human tissue and prove fatal in just a few days .A small wound can become a condition requiring major surgery overnight .For the uninsured , the cost to taxpayers blossoms along with the infection ; a condition that could have been treated immediately and relatively inexpensively early on can quickly become one that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars .If the patient is homeless , he might be sent to a shelter , where he is likely to pass the infection on to others .The Voice Homeless Shelter is full of MRSA , Cononie says .He 's had it three times himself , he says , even though he 's diligent about washing his hands .MRSA does n't just come from hospitals anymore , Memorial Regional spokeswoman Kerning Baldwin says .\" It 's a community problem . \" Memorial is seeing an increasing number of MRSA cases in people who have not been to a hospital or a homeless shelter , she notes .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"110.283905"}
