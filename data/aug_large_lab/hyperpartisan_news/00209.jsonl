' .Honourable chair , Esteemed delegates , it is an honour to represent Poland at this the Royal Russell 29 th annual conference .Poland wishes to tackle many significant issues through debate here .Firstly , we are greatly concerned by the rapidly growing threat posed by climate change .Clearly , global warming is a real and present danger and something that should not be ignored .We are also greatly troubled by the fact that basic human rights are being violated all over the globe .Child labour , euthanasia and racial discrimination are but three examples of the kind of inhumane acts which continue to transpire in this modern age of acceptance and toleration .Poland is particularly concerned with the lack of democratic progress in Afghanistan , where our troops continue to die alongside their allied comrades .Poland would like to see bio fuels widely introduced as an immediate solution to the problem of climate change .Fast and decisive action is clearly needed to resolve this increasingly problematic matter .We would also like to ensure that human rights are properly respected by all countries by making sure that human rights laws are more rigorously enforced .We would like the 2,500 Polish troops in Afghanistan to withdraw as soon as possible and their responsibilities handed over to local , Afghan troops .Poland hopes that this conference will result in decisive , safe and effective resolution of many important issues .Thank you honourable chair , esteemed delegates .and should only cover the most important issues for your particular country . ' 'You mean important issues of the country in general or issues that are included in the agenda of the particular MUN where the speech is held ?Good afternoon delegates and honorable chair of the DISEC committee .\" I warned them that we were creating a monster , \" said Selig Harrison to the CIA .Delegates we are gathered here to discuss the problems of the Arab Spring .The problem started in Tunisia by the Jasmine Revolution .The second problem is that it affects the economy of the nations affected .Also , the sanctions that the western nation will impose wo n't help at all , it will cause a catastrophic effect .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"97.21213"}

Security Council resolutions .This while the North Korean regime remains openly defiant of the international community despite countless attempts to reach a diplomatic resolution .How did North Korea get nuclear weapons ?Hot Air explains how the North Korea deal was presented to the American people by Bill Clinton and his allies in the left - wing news media ( note how similar it is to the way that Obama raved about his deal with Iran ) : .\" This is a good deal for the United States , \" said President Clinton . \"North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program .South Korea and our other allies will be better protected .The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons .\" This whole agreement collapsed in 2002 , when the CIA discovered that North Korea was secretly enriching uranium for further weapons production .You can read about the full chronology for Clinton 's North Korea deal , the subsequent CIA discoveries , and the missile launches that violated the United Nations resolutions .It 's important for young people to know the history of the efforts by Democrats to give goodies to bad actors in the world .It never works , but young people are often not taught about these things in liberal schools .And they do n't do much on their own to find the truth about these issues .Sen. Ted Cruz ( R - Texas ) , asked to respond to North Korea 's test of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States , called for an expanded missile defense capacity and a \" hardened \" electrical grid .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"101.67651"}
