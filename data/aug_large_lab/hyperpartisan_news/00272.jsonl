{"text":"The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution is part of the Bill of Rights and helps guard against \" unreasonable \" searches and seizures by agents of the government .It is solely a right of the people that neither the Executive nor Legislative branch can lawfully abrogate , not even if acting in concert : no statute can make an unreasonable search reasonable , nor a reasonable search unreasonable .It is conceived that a judge will be sufficiently distanced from the authorities seeking a warrant that they can render an impartial decision unaffected by any prejudices or improper motivations they ( or the legislators who enacted a law they are seeking to enforce ) may harbor .Such civil rights violations are sometimes punishable by state or federal law .Evidence obtained in an unlawful search or seizure is generally inadmissible in a criminal trial .Although these are undertaken as a result of statute or Executive order , they should not be seen as deriving their legitimacy from these , rather , the Fourth Amendment explicitly allows reasonable searches , and the government has instituted some of these as public policy .The Supreme Court held in Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) , that the monitoring and recording of private conversations within the United States constitutes a \" search \" for Fourth Amendment purposes , and therefore the government must generally obtain a warrant before undertaking such domestic recordings .The Supreme Court has also held in Smith v Maryland ( 1979 ) that citizens have no Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy in the business records ( sometimes termed metadata ) of their communications .Under Section 215 of the PATRIOT act , the FBI can subpoena some or all such records from a business record holder using a warrant applied for in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .The protection of \" private conversations \" has been held to apply only to conversations where the participants have not only manifested a desire but also a reasonable expectation that their conversation is indeed private and that no other party is listening in .In the absence of such a reasonable expectation , the Fourth Amendment does not apply , and surveillance without warrant does not violate it .Privacy is clearly not a reasonable expectation in communications to persons in the many countries whose governments openly intercept electronic communications , and is of dubious reasonability in countries against which the United States is waging war .The law also recognizes a distinction between domestic surveillance taking place within U.S. borders and foreign surveillance of non - U.S. persons either in the U.S. or abroad .[ 99 ] In United States v.

Benedict Arnold , taking up arms to fight against independence .When it came time for the Constitution , righties who had n't abandoned the newly independent nation tried to have two or three separate nations tying to preserve slavery .As for the Bill of Rights , it was the right that opposed one in the new Constitution even though Virginia had a successful one in its Constitution .Numerous tax cuts for the aristocracy and letting corporations run wild throughout the the ' 20s ended in the Great Depression .Forty Americans had to be murdered by severe right - winger extremists in the ' 60s to get the equality the Constitution had promised to all Americans for a full century , but failed to deliver .Liberals have every right to be disappointed with Barack Obama because he prefers to nibble around the edges of a corrupt system rather than lead the way to an improved America that bygone liberals managed to accomplish .I wo n't deny that Republicans are part of the problem .What I do n't buy is the notion that the Democrats are not .I do n't deny that Republican policies are flawed .What I do n't buy is the notion that Democrat policies are any better .For the most part they are worse .This once great nation was founded - and prospered - on the ideals of liberty and limited government .Neither party represents these ideals , as both believe that more government is the solution to the problem of too much government .And in true partisan fashion , you ignore the \" progressive \" policies of the early 1900 's , in particular the income tax and the creation of the Federal Reserve , and their roles in creating the predicament we find ourselves in today .Policy - wise there is precious little to differentiate the two parties , campaign rhetoric notwithstanding .It 's all about maintaining power , and both will do or say any thing in order to hold onto it .This country is floundering , and with each administration it gets worse - regardless of the party in power .And come 2012 , regardless of who wins the presidency , we will continue down this path .When Obama was elected , the economy was losing up to 9 % of its value .Now it is growing 2 % to 3 % annually .That is worse ?The last month of Buffoon Bush 's reign 800,000 jobs were lost .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"106.223495"}

S. Rep. No . 95 - 604 , pt . 1 , at 9 ( 1977 ) .With minor exceptions , FISA authorizes electronic surveillance only upon certain specified showings , and only if approved by a court .The statute specifically allows for warrantless wartime domestic electronic surveillance -- but only for the first fifteen days of a war .50 U.S.C. § 1811 .It makes criminal any electronic surveillance not authorized by statute , i d .The Department of Justice concedes that the NSA program was not authorized by any of the above provisions .It maintains , however , that the program did not violate existing law because Congress implicitly authorized the NSA program when it enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) against al Qaeda , Pub . L. No . 107 - 40 , 115 Stat .But the AUMF can not reasonably be construed to implicitly authorize warrantless electronic surveillance in the United States during wartime , where Congress has expressly and specifically addressed that precise question in FISA and limited any such warrantless surveillance to the first fifteen days of war .The DOJ also invokes the President 's inherent constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to collect \" signals intelligence \" targeted at the enemy , and maintains that construing FISA to prohibit the President 's actions would raise constitutional questions .But even conceding that the President in his role as Commander in Chief may generally collect signals intelligence on the enemy abroad , Congress indisputably has authority to regulate electronic surveillance within the United States , as it has done in FISA .Where Congress has so regulated , the President can act in contravention of statute only if his authority is exclusive , and not subject to the check of statutory regulation .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"108.72034"}

Bush - a man I supported and voted for - is advancing the cause of freedom .Do n't be influenced in your thinking about the president by the odd gyrations of America 's leftists , who are consumed by Bush - spite .They despise him and embrace kooky ideas about him .It 's almost enough to make one rally to the president 's defense , but we should n't .The enemy of our enemies is not necessarily our friend .Especially when the president , even though I believe him to be a decent man , is busy expanding government power at a pace that would have been unthinkable even under Bill Clinton 's horrible administration .We need to be hardheaded and evaluate this president in the same way we evaluated Clinton , Jimmy Carter and other presidents .I remain a Republican , because over my lifetime , Republicans have been the only party with a winning chance that has come close to advocating , however inadequately , principles of limited government .Watching the Republican Party at the national level over the past three years is causing rethinking on my part .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"119.97772"}
{"text":"War is Peace .Conservative means : submitting as slaves to a government that would shower fear over its subjects all the while having them take a nat'l i d card and a biometric implantable microchip -- oh , wait -- that is just around the corner .Conservative also means : taxing the Amerikan people and having them pay for all that the Security and Prosperity Agreement / North American Union entails .The problem is n't \" Coke or Pepsi \" .It 's a question of character and values among the leaders and the population .A society like our was supposed to be - call it Democracy or Republic or whatever you want - was based on an educated , involved citizenry who held the health of the Republic as a fundamental value .When politics entered the age of the targetted attack ad and a sole concern with winning the next election no matter what it was bad .When the nation as a whole stopped thinking with its forebrain and valued fear above hope it may have been irreperably harmed .When the idea of bi- or multi- partisanship for the common good was replaced with bile , hatred and charges of treason for anyone who had a different affiliation , well , I think we lost and the totalitarians and carpet - baggers won .When responsible people must pay for the mistakes of the irresponsible then we have todays condition .You get punished for responsibility and rewarded for irresponsibility .Only by encouraging irresponsibility can the government get a population that \" needs \" them .Traditionaly a Conservative is someone that wants to conserve the traditional values , and ways .Traditionalist is a similar term .Anyone can be conservative on some issues , and not on others .This is called having an open mind .Politicans who like to tout themselves as a conservative , are useally Not .They are just using the term to fool people in believeing they are for traditional liberal democratic ideals , though they really favour a authoritarian government .Most modern Republican conservatives , are nothing more than authoritarians ( for example Nixon , Bloomberg , Giuliani , Reagan , Gingrich , Bush I & II etc ) whose main goals are to conserve their power in Washington .A true conseravtive does not have to belong to the Republican , Christian right , or anything else that now is defined as conservative , by so called conservatives .Just as being a modern liberal does not mean one is far left .Many moderates and independents can be conservative on certain issues .As long as the size and role of the State and Federal government either remains as it is or , in all likelyhood continues to grow in influence and significance , the parties of Republican and Democrat will continue to achieve parity .They will merely fight for the control of the massive purse strings and power that come along with them .However , \" conservative \" to me at present , remains to be one who espouses a significantly reduced role , size and scope of a Central governmental power .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"122.21614"}
