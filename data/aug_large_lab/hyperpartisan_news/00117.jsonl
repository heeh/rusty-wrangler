{"text":"And for all you people talking about fire escapes and exit routes ... did you actually look at the picture ?Anyway , fighting property management on something like this is going to typically be fruitless .They are going to be very protective of any common space .I 'd say find a place inside the office for it .Later on , try the stairwell again .Then again , it could have been left by the cleaning people who are just pissed that you took over their vertedero .It is likely a fire code violation to have anything in that stairwell , as it is likely a fire exit .I would look for another secure place for the bike and remind them why the outside rack is insufficient for all day , every day use .If they insist you park outside , ask them for a signed promise to insure security of the bike and cover any lose through building insurance .I bet the fire code restricts combustible material from be stored in the fire exit .The boxes themselves are a violation .Yeah , although I did n't list it in my OP , I was wondering about the fire code issue .It is indeed a fire exit , but where the bike is parked does n't block safe egress .( I 'm surprised there 's not a railing across , as I 've seen in other buildings . )But I guess that does n't matter , right ?Actually , my manager rides to work on occasion , mostly during the summer , but probably not as much now .He kept his bike in an area with unoccupied cubicles , but those have since been moved into .There 's also another manager in the group that rides to work on a more regular basis .I do n't know where he parks his bike , but I do know he does n't keep it in his office .Also , I 've seen another bike in the mirror image stairwell on the other side of the building - but no sign there ( yet ) .If we all used the rack it would overflow .Interesting to hear that security does n't necessarily report to HR .I know security here reports to corporate security - but I figure on the local level the local security head has to report to someone locally , whether it 's HR or the office manager - I have to find that out .Although I would probably only elevate the issue after I find an indoor storage solution that does n't involve a potential fire code issue .This is a unique situation , as the company is currently desperate for qualified people , and I 'm thinking HR would be a little more flexible than normal if it would keep employees happy .I know the real answer is to organize all the bike commuters into a commuter club and speak with a louder voice , but unfortunately all of us are too busy to take the lead on that .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"61.432266"}

{"text":"As an ESL teacher , I know that my students often come from countries that have a different idea of community and that offering food is something you just do .How is it any different for you to decide my kid ought to have some candy which I did n't provide , vs. for another parent to decide your kid ought to have some help you did n't provide ?Or someone who takes my child out of a tree although I am standing right there and clearly not objecting to the climbing .Or when I tell my child \" no \" after she calls for help and someone decides to help her anyway .All of these have happened in playgrounds and all annoyed me .That is a HUGE difference from your stance that any attempt to offer anything to an unaccompanied child is somehow underminding parental authority .I do n't expect my own 1st graders to refuse candy if offered .So everyone should never offer any child in the world candy because you do n't want to expect your 1st grader to refuse candy ?I fully expect my 1st grader to do whatever the heck I tell her to do , including refuse candy if so told .Of course , I am sometimes let down in that expectation .But then my beef is with her , not with a person that innocently offered her something that I have told her not to accept .What is so hard about just asking yourself \" would I want someone doing this with my child / would the average parent be OK with it \" before acting ?I never do something for another child that I would object to someone doing for mine .That 's the point .I 'm going to guess that , barring a true pedophile trying to lure a child , EVERYONE who offers a child candy would allow their child to take candy in that particular situation .People do not randomly offer things that are opposed to their own views .You do n't want people to think about what they would do and do that at all .You want them to divine what YOU would do and are bugged when people ( 1 ) think differently about candy than you , and ( 2 ) are incapable of reading your mind .I agree that offering candy to a strange child from a car is odd and not something I would do or want my child to accept .However , I am willing to allow her to accept candy from strangers in a myriad of other situations .You simply believe that everyone should feel the same away about candy and not everyone does .delurking , a police officer who notices something like this and acts on it is definitely doing the kind of community policing thing you 're talking about , and that 's all good .But calling the police on someone is usually something that is done in response to a crime , not something you do because you think that a person might possibly be doing something that could lead to a crime .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"64.98743"}
{"text":"you re welcome !Its not a light chain , mind you .Do chain that to something less movable .I share a bike spot with a neighboor when visiting a friend and lock our bikes together since there is no posts around Two years ago , my wife bought me a steel frame comfort bike from a bike shop in our area .It was a Giant Sedona ST which was great for riding around the neighborhood and some of the parks with short tracks .I heard about this bike club that rides on Saturday mornings and rode with them a few times .Most of the riders there are over 50 and some over 60 , as am I , and most were on hybrids and road bikes and I was having a hard time keeping up .So , after 10 months of the steel bike , I bought a hybrid ( the Cypress ) .I also started getting more addicted to this thing called bicycling and was riding 15 to 20 miles a day .Then I decided , maybe it would be nice to do one of those charity rides that I keep seeing on the flyers at the park .I started riding more miles on the hybrid but there just was n't any way that I was doing 50 to 100 miles on this thing .It 's a great bike , I still ride it a lot but it 's too heavy , the position is n't right for climbing some of the hills where these rides take place and I was always sore after long rides .So , back to the bike shop and I bring home the road bike .At first , I found myself riding the hybrid more than the road bike and was only riding the road bike when training for these distance rides .Now I find myself doing the opposite .Getting on a road bike one time and not really giving it a good ride is n't the best way to determine that you do n't want one .I was happy with the steel bike until the bug bit me .If you as much as think that you are going to get bit by the bug , seriously consider a road bike because if you start doing some serious riding , you are going to eventually get one .Just my experience .... got ta ' go and get ready for my Saturday ride .Taking the Defy .So far you have received what I would consider , some sage advice .Let me some up my version of the same message .IMHO a hybrid type bike is best for you until you get your skills back and your biking fitness up .Any bike style , a hybrid , a hard tail MTB or even a cross bike will do , I would strongly recommend a bike without a suspension fork .Find something that is comfortable and you feel stable on .Do n't be afraid to invest some money in it , get good components .If you make the right choice you will have this bike for a long time ( let 's call it N ) .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"65.266396"}

I would n't want to invest a huge amount of money , but I want a bike that wo n't require upgrades --- just a good bike , ready to ride .Suggestions ?A nice BMX bike is cheaper than an ' okay ' MTB fork ... for under 500 bucks new you can pick up a sweet ride .Go to the local shop and pedal a bunch of them around a bit ; pick the one that feels the least alien .I 'm 46 and I bought the Specialized p26 pro in black and love it .I 've been at Rays in Cleveland several times this winter and felt so good to be airborne again .Started off small then went into foam pit and then jumped into the rhythm room , no tricks yet but jumping felt so good again .I will post some pics .So Jane ( skipdip ) and I went to the Pirates game last night , and I was shocked to find out that bicycle helmets are apparently a security risk and potential weapon , and not allowed in the park .The reason the guard gave me is that helmets are hard and you could whack somebody with them .I tried to explain that they are actually made of porous foam , and designed to crumple when they hit something , thus not hurting ANYTHING , but he would n't have any of it .So one thing I 'm wondering about is how are the souvenir helmets and mini - bats they sell not weapons ?How is a shoe , cell phone , or camera ( all of which are a lot harder than a helmet ) not weapons ?We ended up just locking our helmets to our bike and it was fine , but doing so always makes me nervous and leaves helmets pretty vulnerable to getting smashed by passers by .The way I see it , PNC Park either does n't want you to be safe on your bike ride over , or does n't want you to ride your bike at all .This is more \" Fear the Different \" .It 's not a rational position , so rational argument is irrelevant .It 's rooted in a combination of conformism and status anxiety .I 'm not going to psychoanalyze it here on the Internet , but maybe over beer ... .I guess next time I 'm going to bring up that policy you mentioned , and bring some food and water in a soft - sided 16x16x8 cooler .But , that policy also says no weapons of any kind , and the guy was saying that my helmet was a weapon .I would argue that its a defense , not a weapon .Letting a helmet in is definitely a lot safer than giving out souvenir baseballs , I do n't remember the situation but several years ago on souvenir day , somebody errored and a hail of thousands of balls came raining , or hailing , down on the field .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"68.3369"}

{"text":"Except in ( I guess ) typical male fashion , my fear sparks over into geysers of rage .My heart rate skyrockets , I see stars , my back teeth clench together and I get that urge to lash out .I 'm keeping it in check .I 'm taking deep breaths .I wish I had a damn Xanax .Or four .Mine started when my mom died .I realized the hard way at 30ish I was still very much a mamma 's boy .When she was gone , everything I had leaned on her as a centerpiece came crashing down .A few meetings with a shrink ( ironically from NY ) helped a little , but he yawned a lot and I realized my life really was n't that out of the realm of normal to him .I was n't crazy , it was just stress , and as Tracy said earlier up there it is the new norm .We live in a world that is fast - paced , frenzied , stressful where immediate results and gratifications can never come fast enough .I do take some medication ( Zoloft ) , but I also have lean on God .I am not a religious whacko , but it does help me for what it 's worth -- but it does require a lot of faith and that 's where a lot of times I struggle .But that 's another subject , probably .but even so the daily stresses do still creep in every once in awhile and we have the fight or flight spooky feeling .Popping Xanex ( or generic versions of it ) are a good out , but a more long term answer might be to examine some of the sources of stress in your life and to try to manage / minimalize them or even eliminate some of them all together if possible .Sometimes I try Golf , but last night I came away from the course feeling more stressed then when I went out there -- in other words , it only works if you have your \" A game \" going ( as Tiger would say ) .Masturbation might help some , but it 's not usually the type of thing you can just do in the middle of a busy day at the office when you feel the onset of panic or anxiety .Well , I guess you can , but you might get that talk from the boss .I would think that living in NYC or in the area ( or any major metropolis ) , has to be much much more stressful on a daily basis then living where I live in B.F.E. Nebraska .Especially these days .I know you have posted about moving in the past , but then again geographical cures usually only work temporarily in cases of panic attacks because the problem usually comes mostly from within .Depression could cause these attacks as well , but my shrink put me through me some depression tests and it was n't the root of my problem .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"75.59285"}

{"text":"When the government fails to properly punish criminals , and atmosphere of unrest is created whereby citizens then feel compelled to punish or chase down criminals .If this woman is still out there driving , the Korean government and justice system have failed .What 's the point in having drunk driving laws if the driver in an accident can merely pay off the victim and get back on the road ?Korea can not yet call itself a developed country with systems like this in place .The Korean justice system more closely resembles that of Pakistan than of any so - called developed country . commander .Before jumping to a conclusion of ineffectiveness of Korea 's judicial system , we may need to think about what happened behind the driver 's impunity .First , how much drunken the driver was is hard to determine , making it hard to punish the driver for exceeded blood alcohole level .Second , the motorist who was hit but is known to have minor injuries .It is not known whether the victim wants a out of court settlement or seek to take this case to a court .If there is unwillingness to file a lawsuit by the victim for some reasons , it ca n't help it .Third , the driver violated several traffic rules in the footage like driving on the opposite lane .All these factors appear to be not sufficient to give tough punishment to her .I am not meant to defend the troubling driver , but to make a guess about why the driver receive much less of what Netizens say should have been a harsh punishment .The Real Truth .I realize that Koreans are world famous for their horrible driving , in fact they have elevated horrible driving to a high art form .However , the article says that the woman was not prosecuted because she paid off the victim with cash .The problem is that despite bribing the victim , she committed various other crimes that when combined together are quite serious .This begs the question ; what exactly does one have to do in order to get jail time in Korea , or lose one 's license ?Crossing divider into oncoming traffic 2 .Hitting a motorcycle rider head - on 3 .Failure to render reasonable care ( this is a Korean law , you have to offer reasonable care to an accident victim if you cause an accident where the other party is injured ) 4 .Fleeing the scene of an accident ( hit and run ) 5 .Failure to stop at a red light 6 .Illegal u - turn 7 .Failure to stop at a red light again 8 .Driving under the influence of alcohol ( according to article ) 9 .Driving on the wrong side of the road .Can you spot any more violations ?Now , you go back and negotiate with the motorbike rider .He is probably a peasant too , and being only slightly injured , is probably looking forward to getting his bribe money from the driver in exchange for not pressing charges .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"76.5018"}
{"text":"Anyone with bike tips for Heinz please post 'em up as I 've decided to be punished by the Pitt Panthers this year instead of watching boy quarterbacks with disguisting & criminal off field . behavior ( although , the Panthers may be headed there too if the recent news is any indication ) .Sorry you ran into a guard who would n't let your helmet in .I suspect the motorcycle helmet mention on the web page may have fueled their concerns .I suspect there is an interesting story behind the ban on motorcycle helmets ....I doubt that is posted on the PNC website just by whim .Try to get the situation rectified through PNC management , but at the end of the day keep in mind that biking to a baseball game is pretty damn awesome and the fun helps alleviate the pain of watching the Bucs \" clinch \" their 18th loosing season .Checked with the Pirates / PNC Park and bicycle helmets are unfortunately not allowed into the ballpark .They consider bicycle helmets to be ' hard sided items ' and thus prohibit them from the ballpark for security purposes .They will be updating their Web site and policy manual to make it more clear going forward , and will also reiterate the rule to the security staff .We would love to work with them to update their policies to become more bike friendly in the future .Like I said before , this is just the beginning of this relationship so we hope that with a little time and some good communication we can make some progress together .In the meantime we suggest that people who ride to the games use the racks around the periphery of the stadium and use a U - lock to secure helmets with the bike .We have not heard of any instances of helmets being tampered with to date .Concurrently we will try to work with the Pirates to revisit this policy .Riders could also consider parking in the Cultural District downtown and walking over the Clemente bridge .There are 21 wall - racks at the Bike Commuter Center and all of the downtown Pittsburgh Parking Authority Garages have free sheltered bike racks , some even near an attendant .maybe .but i do believe bicycle helmets ought to be allowed , even if motorcycle helmets are not .and i rather think motorcycle helmets ought to be allowed , though i 'd like to hear if there are stories that support the opposite view .Motorcycles parked in a bike rack .I do n't like seeing people park their motorcycles at a bike rack , rather than in the parking lot where all the cars park .The motorcycles take up the space that several regular bicycles could use .The motorcycles do n't belong there .But on the other hand , a motorcycle does get much better gas mileage than a car , and I 'd rather see people riding a motorcycle than driving a car .At my last job I was fortunate to have a bike locker ( big plastic pod with locking door ) .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"76.50813"}

'\" Now the knight - reading this - thought that the princess had overheard the first part of the conversation rather than the last , and that she was telling him that she did not want to marry him .Devastated , he hid in his castle for many days , talking to no one , and turning away any owls that arrived .The evil bugs realised something was afoot , and wrote stories about what might be troubling him , but as he would not talk to anyone , no one knew .Finally , his friends could stand it no longer , and so one of his closest friends - the wisest witch in all the land - apparated straight into his bedroom .Into his bedroom ? \" the little girl questioned sleepily . \" But , he might have been in his pyjamas .Indeed he was in his pyjamas , but the witch did n't care , as she knew that he needed her , even if he did n't know it himself .So , she apparated in , forced him out of bed , and made him drink a big cup of coffee to wake him up .Then , when he was ready , she made him tell her what had happened . \"However , by the end of the tale , she was just as confused as he was .She knew that the princess loved the knight , because she was friends with the princess too .Indeed , she even knew that the princess had been baking him a cake , though she had been sworn to secrecy about this .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"81.076035"}

Afterward , she had a choice : Stay at school , eat and play computers or come home with mommy .She chose home , on the walk back she tells me she chose to come with me because she loves having time together .She 's such a thoughtful , bright , funny little girl - this made my mothersday even more special this year !Until next time - keep dreaming .Share this : .Like this : .Today 's weather was really weird .It was blue skys in the morning with fluffy white clouds .I managed to wash and hang a load of bedclothes out on my line to dry in the breeze that picked up in the afternoon .Thunder storms for some of the region were announced via the weather network and various sources on Twitter , so we anticipated a storm .My daughter wanted to ride her bike before it started to rain .Daddy set her up with her helmet and his set of riding rules , she 's still learning .With that she was off doing laps while daddy cut the grass and I went to tend to little man .After daddy was done cutting the grass I went out and watched her ride around .She was so proud !It brought back memories of feeling the joy of learning to ride a bike - I 'm rusty these days .She beat the rain , by minutes but she had a fun time even if it was just outside our front door .It 's the little things that make them smile , which make us smile .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"83.73405"}

{"text":"She got scared and started to run .One of the men got out of the car and started to chase her .She ran to the gas station that was two buildings away and man chasing ran back to the car and they drove away .Kids should n't be afraid of all strangers but to me it just seems like common sense to not offer candy to strange children considering it is common advise to tell kids not to take candy from strangers .I do n't think it is bad advice either .Stranger abductions are rare but they do occasionally happen and offering candy to a child to gain their trust has been used to kidnap children in the past .It does n't sound like that lady was really a threat but she probably should have found some neighbourhood kids that she knows to give the candy to or maybe drop it off at a youth centre .Thank goodness this happened in PA .If it was in LA , I would be worried for my life driving around in my Suburban , after what happened to the two women delivering newspapers when the cop killer was on the loose .Hate to think what they would do to me in my much older Suburan that also is n't the same color .Oh , and yes , I live in WA , but the way they were going there with the shooter , I would still stay home .All my kid had to do to get offered tons of candy by strangers was to go to school .I do n't know what it was about the teachers , but for some reason they felt the only motivator for a child was candy .And my daughter came home with some every day , including the first day when the teacher WAS a stranger .( And she got stranger as the year went on , but that is another story ! )When I was about 8 , we had a discussion in class about what to do if a stranger offered us candy .Every kid in the class seemed to agree that you would quickly run the other way and find an adult and report it .Some of the kids spoke of people in limousines stopping next to them to offer them candy , rides , etc .Others talked about temporary tattoos laced with LSD .Years later I found out that some of these were debunked as urban myths , and others were probably flat out made up by kids in class who wanted attention .LOL , thanks for the laugh .I once had an older lady approach my son & I and ask if she could give him some bubbles .It caught me off guard as unusually , but I said OK & thanked her .I have friends who I know would have run the other way .Love it , Lenore !Wish I 'd found a kid to give my Easter eggs too , before I gave in and ate them myself , LOL !","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"84.32088"}
{"text":"So it came as a shock when the allure of a female voice was so addicting after being bombarded with male writing - in fact Lackey was the first female EF author I had ever read back when .It was a shock to read a book that actually had emotions and plots that worked with them .Of course the idea of mystical horses that can mind - link to humans and have the same intelligence ( if not smarter ) of their riders is any little or grown - up girls dream .The horses are mystical - maybe even divine - creatures that protect the kingdom in more ways then even their Heralds .Considering their Heralds act as enforcers of the law , spies , ambassadors , negotiators , warriors , assassins , and so much more - it 's pretty impressive .Talia comes from a repressive society of Holder Kin , that believe women are no better then housewives .The villages are basically polygamist settlements where women marry at thirteen , or are vowed into silence as priestesses .Talia is immediately relatable as a young girl who dreams of more and finds her escape in the few books that she can get her hands on .So when she 's confronted with an arranged marriage , I was only too willing to follow along Talia 's escape into the world of Heralds and Companions .Where outside of Holder Kin society women are equal to men .Lackey 's \" emo reputation \" probably comes from the fact that she is not afraid to deal with negative emotions .Talia has been repressed by her abusive upbringing , she suffers from low self - esteem and doubts .Heralds are asked to justly serve the kingdom and set aside personal feelings and prejudice .Talia is also Queen 's Own , which is a position as the main advisor and friend to the current ruler .Even though Talia 's Companion makes her Queen 's Own by picking her , this book is still a journey on Talia truly becoming a person to fit that role .Life - bonded couples - much like soul mates - are a favorite topic of negative opinions from other reviewers .While some characters state it was love at first sight , the relationships do n't start then .Lackey is all about character growth and nothing is ever easy , so do n't be afraid about mushy - gooey soul mates spoiling the storyline .Arrows of the Queen may only be a 230 page book , but it covers more story then most 700 page books .Lackey 's writing style is easy to get into , and is classy enough to forget the few typo issues at the beginning .Even though some characters do n't even get a page appearance , as they 're only brought up in conversation , you know who they are and what happens to them - even caring about them .This is my third time visiting this book , and it still manages to enchant me .It covers the training years of Talia , being the time honored tale of escape from the mundane lives we live to something incredible .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"84.335106"}

{"text":"Then your chest tightens up and it feels like your heart has just seized up and turned to stone .Except all that does n't matter to a person in the throes of an anxiety attack .No matter how much you know that you are not dying , it still feels like this is the end .I am going to die .DIE .Right here , right now .There is no way you can convince me that my untimely death is not imminent .Now imagine all this in Monday morning traffic on a busy road .I tried to conjure up all those exercises I learned over the past 25 years that help alleviate the attacks .Multiplication tables .But they just would n't come to me .Not even the simple two times tables .I concentrated on the song playing .Pushed the lyrics out of my mouth , which only wanted to form a small \" o \" , like the look of someone in a constant state of surprise .I sing , loud .Four months at sea , four months of calm seas only to be pounded in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point .I suck in air .In with the good , out with the bad , the mantra my religion teacher taught me in 12th grade when I confided to her that I started having panic attacks .I finally pull into the parking lot at work , I 'm early and the place is nearly deserted so no one sees me practicing some bizarre form of Lamaze breathing as I walk up the ramp and into the doors .My office is a safe place to continue on with the attack .Unlike being in my moving two ton car , going crazy while sitting in my office chair is n't going to result in harm to anyone else .It 's still quiet here .None of my bosses are in yet .I plug my iPod in , put on some calming music and forego the morning coffee in favor of a glass of cold water .The biggest myth about anxiety attacks is that the person suffering one has brought it on by thinking too hard about their problems .Mostly , they just come out of the blue .I rarely have suffered an anxiety attack while I was in the midst of wallowing in my problems .The anxiety always manifests itself later , at some unsuspecting time .Like 7:40 a.m. on a Monday morning on Hempstead Turnpike when the only thing I was thinking of - as I passed by Nassau Coliseum - was the fun I used to have going to Islander games .I do n't bother asking for help or telling anyone what 's going on because people who have never had an anxiety attack can not understand what goes on in a person 's brain when they are having one .A pat on the back and a \" stop worrying so much \" consolation does n't help .It 's not about worry .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"96.00537"}
