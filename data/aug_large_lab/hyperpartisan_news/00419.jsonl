{"text":"Sound simple ?Perhaps .But think about this .Imagine an ancestral group of hominids with a powerful but unfair and selfish leader who happens to also be bigger and stronger than any of the others in the group ( which is how he got this leadership position in the first place ) .Attacking him physically would be risky ; he can punch harder than you can - remember , he is big and strong .But throwing a rock - well that can smart a bit - doesn't have the same potential costs as close - up physical confrontation .In fact , thrown just right , a rock can kill someone .But the cost to the thrower is , again , small in terms of time and energy .When humans first evolved the ability to accurately throw projectiles in this way , they gained the ability to hold coercive threat over others in an evolutionarily unprecedented manner .Couple this with another aspect of humans that is clearly part of our evolutionary story - the forming of social alliances .Humans are clearly social beings and we often form alliances with others beyond kin lines ( in other words , we form strong alliances and friendships with non - relatives ) .So now imagine a group of three or four males who are smaller than the leader but who form a group , with a vision , of creating a clan ( or society ) that affords them and their families more in the way of power and resources .This small group can be powerful .With shared vision and the ability to accurately throw from a distance , a small group can , in fact , be more powerful than a single large leader .The ability to emit coercive threat from a distance coupled with the proclivity to form significant social alliances may well have given rise to the nature of politics in human groups .In such a scenario , the social playing field can be leveled , and both egalitarianism and democracy can emerge .Our natural tendency , then , may well be democracy .Can the evolutionary approach help us understand the roots of human politics ?I think so .While most often the accusations of \" reductionism \" are wrong in many ways , I think this is too reductionist and may indeed make one grow a beard and light a pipe and mumble \" just so .\" Chimps form just this kind of male alliance and yet they do not have groups defined by culture or any kind of Democracy .There is something more going on .First , hidden estrus is a huge generally ignored factor .This makes the cost of trying to monopolize mating opportunities , the point of being a dominant male , far higher since vigilance must be constant instead of for a few days every month .It also lowers the rewards , since more females will manage to sneak off .Then add in the ability to not just throw stones , but to make stones sharp .Now even a weak male alone who surprises the dominant male can kill them .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"66.39002"}
