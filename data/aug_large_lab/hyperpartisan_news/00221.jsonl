{"text":"Which is why the ACLU and their partner civil rights organizations are in court today re - opening a lawsuit from last year over whether the state 's purge program violated the National Voter Registration Act because it started within 90 days of a federal election .A federal judge ruled it did not , but the civil rights attorneys are appealing that decision before a three - judge panel in the 11th Circuit U.S. District Court of Appeals in Miami .The 90-day \" quiet period \" was created so elections officials are not scrambling to verify voters ' registration status at the last second and to give voters time to clear up any problems . \"Florida , with its history of inaccurate purges which have penalized innocent voters , should proceed with caution , \" said Robert M. Brandon , president of the Fair Elections Legal Network .\" Once someone unfairly loses their vote , they can not get it back .Our organizations have come together in this suit to ensure someone is speaking out for the average voter .\" The state believes it has resolved any issues around inaccuracies in identifying non - citizens through its new , though limited , access to the SAVE database , which is monitored by a memorandum of understanding between the state and DHS .One of those understandings is that SAVE is still not a definitive source for verifying citizenship .In a fact sheet created for voter registrants by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services , custodians of the SAVE database , the federal agency says that it is not suitably equipped to vouch for citizenship .They \" can only verify naturalized or derived citizens , to the extent that a derived citizen received an official determination on citizenship by \" the agency , the sheet states .\" The inability of the SAVE Program to verify your citizenship does not necessarily mean that you are not a citizen of the United States and are ineligible to vote , \" the sheet reminds voters .Meanwhile , in Virginia , the state has already begun purging voters -- and just in time for high - profile gubernatorial race between former national Democratic Party Chairman Terry McAuliffe and Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli .The Virginia Democratic Party has sued the state over a list of roughly 57,000 Virginia voters ' names that the state has asked county election officials to purge from rolls .In Fairfax County , near Washington , D.C. , over 7,000 names have already been purged .Cuccinelli is named in the lawsuit .The names were culled from an interstate database that appears to show these voters as registered in multiple states .Associated Press reported today that half the states in the nation have signed into this network to also locate and scrub voter names appearing in multiple jurisdictions .Republicans say voters being registered in more than one place opens up the electoral process to voter fraud , though no such interstate double - voting fraud has occurred in the state 's history .Names often end up on multiple states ' voter registration lists simply because they have n't been updated , meaning someone who was registered in North Carolina , for example , may have moved to Virginia and registered to vote under her new address .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"52.590286"}

Rick Scott 's staff combed through the information of 80,000 registered voters to find out who was not an American citizen , and thereby ineligible to vote .Scott found only one individual on the list who was not an American citizen - more evidence that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent .Wang accentuated the importance of early registration and same - day registration as ways to increase participation .She stated that when North Carolina used early voting and same - day registration in the 2008 election , participation in the African - American community skyrocketed from 59 % in 2004 to 72 % in 2008 .Clarissa Martinez and Carmen Barkley continued the discussion , touching upon the barriers that Latino voters and young voters face .Martinez emphasized the need to combat suppression tactics and ensure that Latino communities are not confused with the election process .She advocated for the criminalization of deceptive practices and misinformation , which affect Latinos and recently naturalized citizens who may be unsure of how to navigate the voting process .Berkley , a campaigner for young people 's voting rights , stressed that since there are 46 million people under 29 who are eligible to vote this election , it is crucial to raise awareness and educate young people about the voting process .Many young people do not have a government issued ID or do not know the last four digits of their Social Security number , making them unqualified to vote in some states .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"57.302856"}

Holder .That decision invalidated Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , which made inoperable Section 5 , a provision requiring the Justice Department or a D.C.-based federal court panel to pre - clear all election - law changes in nine states and multiple jurisdictions .The court rightly noted that the data on which the law was based are no longer valid , and that times have changed .The National Voter Registration Act imposed sweeping changes on the conduct of American elections .These changes included significant federal mandates on state and local election officials that restricted the ability of those officials to maintain clean and accurate voter rolls while simultaneously obliging them to maintain clean and accurate voter rolls .For most of the history of the law , enforcement actions have been directed against election officials who sought to clean voter rolls and against states for insufficiently pushing voter registration among entitlement recipients .The U.S. Department of Justice , however , has refused to enforce the requirement that election officials maintain clean and accurate voter rolls .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"63.727345"}

Paul then went one step further by stating that there is n't any evidence that suggests Blacks are barred from voting any more than Whites .Speaking at the Louisville Forum , Sen. Paul mentioned that the historic Voting Rights Act was placed into law for sound reasons and that the federal government should still oversee the violation of individual voting rights , reports WFPL .But according to Sen. Paul , African Americans are clearly no longer disenfranchised at the polls : .The interesting thing about voting patterns now is in this last election , African Americans voted at a higher percentage than Whites in almost every one of the states that were under the special provisions of the federal government .So really , I do n't think there is objective evidence that we 're precluding African Americans from voting any longer .And while census numbers back up the senator 's statement , with Blacks voting at 66 percent when compared to 64 percent for Whites , it also must be noted that one of the chief catalysts of African - American voter turnout in 2012 was voter suppression .With Republican lawmakers pushing last - minute voter ID laws to seemingly stifle the Black vote , African Americans showed up at the polls in unprecedented numbers .Romney won the White vote 58 - 41 ( 2008 : John McCain won 52 - 46 ) .Romney won White men 63 - 36 ( 2008 : McCain won 53 - 45 ) .Romney won White women at about the same margin as four years ago , 53 - 46 .But the White vote overall was 79 percent of the turnout , down 4 points from 2008 ( White men : 3 points ; White women : 1 point ) .The Ohio population is about 84 percent white .Ohio has a low percentage of Hispanic population ( 3 percent ) compared to the national average ( 17 % ) and the exit polling had the Hispanic vote at 3 percent , a 1-point decrease from 2008 .Obama made up the margin by turning out the African - American vote , which increased from 11 percent in 2008 to 15 percent yesterday .He won these voters 96 - 4 and the higher turnout more than made up for any slight movement from his 2008 97 - 2 margin .What 's more notable , African Americans make up 12 percent of the Ohio population , but they represented a higher share of the electorate yesterday .In addition , Republican - dominant state legislatures have been rushing to get new Voter ID and other voting law adjustments passed into law ahead of critical election cycles in 2014 and 2016 .And with the High Court taking away the Justice Department 's ability to approve these sweeping changes to voting rights , critics of the new voting laws allege this is nothing more than another attempt to undermine and disrupt the Black vote .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"64.98634"}

( AP ) - Secretary of State Kris Kobach 's successful push to require new Kansas voters to document their U.S. citizenship has spawned three lawsuits , including one he pursued against a federal agency in trying to enforce the policy .Kansas is one of only four states that make new voters show a birth certificate , passport or other citizenship papers .The Kansas requirement took effect in 2013 , and Kobach has directed county election officials to cancel more than 31,000 incomplete registrations , most from people who 've failed to comply with the requirement .A federal district court on Tuesday refused to expand the kinds of identification voters can use , rejecting the arguments made by a special interest group that aimed to make voting easier for students , veterans and people with out - of - state driver 's licenses .The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin 's voter ID law earlier this year , claiming the law was unconstitutional due to its limitations .The ACLU asked the court Oct. 5 to expand the law to include IDs for veterans , IDs for technical college students and out - of - state driver 's licenses .They argued the law arbitrarily excluded those classes of people .District Judge Lynn Adelman rejected the ACLU 's arguments in his decision .Adelman explained that a line must be drawn between acceptable and unacceptable forms of ID , otherwise the state would have to create and maintain an infinite list .Adelman believed the logistics of expanding the list of acceptable forms of ID could hinder the state 's capability of administering the law , but also conceded the state could have added veteran 's IDs to the list . \"To be sure , Wisconsin probably could have included veteran 's ID on the list ... without significantly increasing its administrative burden , \" Adelman said in his opinion . \"However ... the state had to draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable forms of ID somewhere . \"A bill signed Saturday by California Gov.

{"text":"The number of American teens who excel at advanced math has surged .Why ?O n a sultry evening last July , a tall , soft - spoken 17-year - old named David Stoner and nearly 600 other math whizzes from all over the world sat huddled in small groups around wicker bistro tables , talking in low voices and obsessively refreshing the browsers on their laptops .The air in the cavernous lobby of the Lotus Hotel Pang Suan Kaew in Chiang Mai , Thailand , was humid , recalls Stoner , whose light South Carolina accent warms his carefully chosen words .The tension in the room made it seem especially heavy , like the atmosphere at a high - stakes poker tournament .Stoner and five teammates were representing the United States in the 56th International Mathematical Olympiad .They figured they 'd done pretty well over the two days of competition .God knows , they 'd trained hard .Stoner , like his teammates , had endured a grueling regime for more than a year - practicing tricky problems over breakfast before school and taking on more problems late into the evening after he completed the homework for his college - level math classes .Sometimes , he sketched out proofs on the large dry - erase board his dad had installed in his bedroom .Most nights , he put himself to sleep reading books like New Problems in Euclidean Geometry and An Introduction to Diophantine Equations .The tight grip of oligarchy upon the American political system slipped a little last night in New Hampshire .On the Democratic side , voters cast their ballots for one of the most implausible candidates in modern presidential history - less because his rhetoric was so mesmerizing or his program so inspiring than as a protest against an expected winner perceived as a lavishly compensated servitor of organized wealth .In her concession speech , Hillary Clinton boasted of her small donors .More than 70 percent had given less than $ 100 , she claimed : \" I know that does n't fit with the narrative . \"As Ken Vogel of Politico immediately tweeted , the claim also distorts the facts .Clinton may have a lot of donors , but the bulk of the value of her donations-85 percent - has come from the biggest givers .And her family 's personal wealth , and its foundation 's assets , can also be seen as built on the largesse of banks , corporations , and foreign governments .It was the apotheosis of the outsiders - two candidates , written off when their campaigns began , recovering from defeat in Iowa to deliver resounding victories in the Granite State .In a year of outsider success , Tuesday 's New Hampshire primary was the apotheosis of the outsiders .On the Democratic side , Senator Bernie Sanders coasted to a huge victory over Hillary Clinton .And for the Republicans , Donald Trump regained his footing after a letdown in Iowa , winning about a third of the vote and notching a huge victory over the rest of the GOP field .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"105.90886"}

{"text":"A left - leaning group called the Voter Participation Center has touted the distribution of some 5 million registration forms in recent weeks , targeting Democratic voting blocs such as unmarried women , blacks , Latinos and young adults .But residents and election administrators around the country have also reported a series of bizarre and questionable mailings addressed to animals , dead people and people already registered to vote .( AP Photo / Elaine Thompson )The liberal group Voter Participation Center sent out 5,000,000 voter registration forms - many to dogs and dead people .The groups says it has registered more than 350,000 since last September 2011 .( Full Story here . )BEDFORD COUNTY , VA -- When Tim Morris got his mail last week he found a pretty big surprise , a document asking his dog Mozart to register to vote .Not only is Mozart a dog but he 's been dead for two years .I opened it up and looked at it and I just laughed , \" Morris said .\" I thought it was a joke at first and it turns out it 's real .The form is addressed to Mo , the family 's nickname for the dog .What amazed Morris is that if Mozart was human he would have been eligible to vote for the first time in 2012 .He would have been 19 years old this year and he passed away two years ago , \" he said .\" I still have no earthly idea how they got his information .10On Your Side looked deeper and found that the voter registration forms were sent by the non - profit Voter Participation Center , not the State Board of Elections .6 comments : . & PA .McCain WAS ALERTED 2 the FRAUD .Yes , we need to vote the Liar - in - Chief out of office ! !The Dems must be getting pretty desperate if they are sending voter registrations to dead animals .And I agree with miltoncross ... we need everyone 's vote .That is going to be the only way that we can win & send this man & his cronies packing back to his adopted city of Chicago .Hey , everyone please make a concerted effort to vote this socialist and all his America hating minions out of office on November 6th , tell your friends , family , neighbors and anyone else who will listen , we need their votes to save America .Vote the Blamer / Complainer / Campaigner - in - Chief out of office .I need some clarification : I understand that organizations such as the NAACP , Acorn and Acorn spin - offs are involved in voter registration .according to your account , they submit many thousands of registrations , and there is reason to think that some are not valid .Registrations of family pets and people who are dead can only be turned into fraudulent votes if someone either attends at the polls to vote , claiming to be the registrant , or if someone sends in an absentee ballot in that name .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"110.714035"}
