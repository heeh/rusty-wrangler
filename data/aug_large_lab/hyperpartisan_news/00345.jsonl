{"text":"Second , there are the related questions of interest and class .Most intellectuals today still live in a guild economy .The learned professions - lawyers , doctors , university professors , the clergy of most mainline denominations , and ( aspirationally anyway ) school teachers and journalists - are organized in modern day versions of the medieval guilds .Membership in the guilds is restricted , and the self - regulated guilds do their best to uphold an ideal of service and fairness and also to defend the economic interests of the members .The culture and structure of the learned professions shape the world view of most American intellectuals today , but high on the list of necessary changes our society must make is the restructuring and in many cases the destruction of the guilds .Just as the industrial revolution broke up the manufacturing guilds , the information revolution today is breaking up the knowledge guilds .Guild methods are too expensive given society 's rapidly increasing need for the services they provide ; we must drastically raise productivity by re - imagining the way our society makes and distributes the services that , currently , the guilds and the learned professions provide .Guilds are not very good at mass production , and our need for the services they produce has become so great that only a much more efficient production process can serve .Health care , education and legal services are all economic sectors where prices have been rising more rapidly than the overall rate of inflation .These professions must be fundamentally restructured ; a Marxist would speak at this point about the proletarianization of the petit bourgeois intellectual professions .Fortunately for the rest of society if not for the guilds , developments in IT and telecommunications now make it possible to reduce costs dramatically in the learned professions .Outsourcing and automation between them can transform the production and delivery of these services .Moreover , the process of disintermediation will enable many Americans to dispense with the expensive services of the professional classes .Basic legal services and advice can increasingly be found , free or at very low cost , on the internet .Many Americans have substituted tax software for accountants ; more and more activities once performed by highly paid professionals will be performed by computers and the internet .Ultimately one suspects that services once reserved for elites will be available for the masses , just as the industrial revolution enabled mass ownership of goods that had once been the preserve of small elites .The effect will not only be to raise living standards for most people by improving their access to useful services .It will also be to transfer power and authority from the provider of such services to the consumer .When my grandfather was a doctor , his patients mostly did what he told them to do .He was the expert and there was no rival source of information - especially as many of his patients had little or no formal education and in some cases struggled to write their own names .Today , well - educated patients ( many of whom have college and advanced degrees and must routinely master complicated bodies of knowledge in their own work ) check with the internet and search the archives of web - based support groups to challenge their doctors ' prescriptions .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"40.02336"}

I. Bill , the Vannevar Bush government - university research partnership , and the National Defense Education Act ) .Hence it is likely that limited incentives coupled with strong institutional flexibility to respond to market forces are far more likely to achieve systemic change in higher education , aligning it better with national need , than top - down regulation .Moreover , market pressure and competition not only provide the resources for quality , but also stimulate the innovation and build the experience .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"44.450943"}

{"text":"A third socially conservative party could split from the Republican Party .In a sense , the Republicans would have the same problem the Democratic Party had from the 1950s to 1980s -- an inability to hold the South while still only making marginal gain in the North .Further compounding the problem is the fact all of the demographic growth in the House and Elector College is in the South and Southwest .Hence , this strategy would improve Republican performance in states with diminishing influence on national elections .Strategy 3 : Sellout the base and attract working class minorities .Upside : Working class minorities represent the backbone of the Democratic Party .If the Republicans could steal the base of the Democrats ( like they did in the 1970s and 80s with whites ) , they could return to dominance .The Republicans could soften their positions on immigration and some economic issues .They could emphasize social issues like abortion and same - sex marriage ( or bring back \" law and order \" issues ) .This strategy might improve Republican performance among latinos in particular .Downside : First , this strategy would further push powerful suburban voters out of the Republican Party .Second , it might not even be that effective in stealing the Democratic based .When President Obama announced his support for same - sex marriage , black voters simply became more tolerant of the practice .This episode suggests minority voters , while more socially conservative than other Democratic voters , do not have hardened positions .A substantial shift on immigration issues may help , but not without damaging the Republican Party with socially conservative white voters .On this note , the Democrats could easily counter by simply demanding more drastic concessions on immigration , which would force the Republican to depress their base or renege on its concessions to minorities .Strategy 4 : Do n't sell out the base , but try to reach out to specific minority groups .Upside : Some fast - growing minority groups , such as Asians , south Asians , affluent latinos , and multi - ethnic voters , may be easier for the Republican Party to attract than core minority groups ( i.e. blacks and working class latinos ) .These groups are also fast growing and could become a formidable force in some key states like California .Republicans could make inroads with these groups if they repackage their image as a more inclusive party .Because these groups tend to be more economically and socially conservative , the party would not have to change its policies substantially .Downside : Attracting votes from specific minority groups without targeting core minorities might simply be too little , too late .This strategy might be most effective when combined with some combination of the other approaches .Strategy 5 : Reinvent and rebrand conservatism .Upside : Conservatives worked hard to rebrand themselves after the Great Depression debacle .They became internationalists and eventually found new policy positions that attracted voters ( such as lower taxes ) .After Democrats inevitably overstep their political mandates , the Republicans could reintroduce themselves to a generation of young voters .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"46.379227"}

{"text":"Immigration and Its Deep Roots in Social Justice .Comprehensive immigration reform has been a hotly contested issue in recent times across many states and on the national stage .But restrictive immigration policies will cause unintended economic consequences , adversely affect first class digital citizenship , and stifle entrepreneurship opportunities for minorities .The issues surrounding comprehensive immigration reform are of compelling public interest , as well as the national and economic interests of the technology , media , and telecommunication industries , which constitute one - sixth of our nation 's economy .Hispanics - the largest group of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. - say their immigration status is the \" most important factor \" leading to discrimination against them .According to Pew Research Center , more than 60 percent of Hispanics say discrimination against them is a \" major problem .\" This problem ultimately discourages Hispanic immigrants from adopting broadband at home and hinders their participation in the mainstream economic market , which hurts our economy .Fear of personal disclosure , deportation , and family division can make these immigrants hesitant to take advantage of our digital society .In fact , more than half of all U.S. Hispanic adults live in fear of deportation of a close friend , family member , or even themselves .As a result , these communities are less likely to obtain healthcare , seek employment , engage in civic duties , and pursue educational opportunities .Hispanics also demonstrate concerns over online privacy , exacerbating the above problems when we live in an age where access to these opportunities is much easier with an Internet connection .Thus , to prevent the digital divide from widening and to ease their fears about personal disclosure on the Internet , we must educate these communities about the benefits of broadband adoption and digital literacy .Comprehensive immigration reform can resolve these issues and provide an overall benefit to the economy and therefore all of American society .Currently , the discrimination that immigrants encounter drives them out of the mainstream economy and negatively affects their earning and spending power .If Congress enacts well - thought - out comprehensive immigration reform , this trend could reverse .Undoubtedly , these projected earnings and consumption increases could translate into more computer and mobile technology purchases plus broadband adoption , which all improve digital literacy skills and boost our digital economy .Comprehensive immigration reform can also improve small business ownership , a further benefit to the economy .In 2010 , immigrants were nearly twice as likely to launch new businesses in the U.S. than their U.S.-born counterparts , and immigrants were more likely to apply for patents for business start - ups .In fact , they were responsible for the explosive growth in patenting per capita that year , which increased the U.S. GDP .However , if we do n't fix our immigration system , it will inhibit minority entrepreneurship and discourage future immigrant entrepreneurs from competing on American soil .Immigrants have developed cutting - edge technologies and founded some of the nation 's top firms .First - generation immigrants and their children founded nearly 43 percent of U.S. Fortune 500 companies , including Google and eBay .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"47.95397"}

Bush further cut federal grants to low - income students during his period in office .In the Clinton years , the New Democrats took the centrist strategy of targeted tax relief for middle - class families with children attending college .While at the state level funding has been up and down , the general pattern of flat funding for higher education has been continued up to the present .Loans are often not attractive to economically disadvantaged students because of practical and cultural hesitations to taking on loan debt .The numbers indicate that low - income students tend to take out loans less often and for lower amounts than middle and upper - class students .Q : You write that \" some institutions , especial[ly ] for - profits , opt out of the [ rankings / prestige ] competition and instead focus on meeting student needs directly .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"53.190125"}

{"text":"Hence , if the Democrats carry momentum into the 2014 election , only a small handful of Democrats will be beatable .On the other hand , as many as 50 or so Republicans represent suburban districts in which they could be defeated in a Democratic wave .This fact leaves open the possibility of a Democratic takeover of the House .Nevertheless , this outcome is made unlikely by several factors .First , one can not assume the Democrats will maintain their momentum .An election without Democratic momentum will likely lead to little change in the House .Second , many of the 50 seats up for grabs will not switch parties .Only a handful of the above districts held by Republicans voted for Obama in 2012 .Moreover , about half of these districts lean Republican by at least four or five points .Such an advantage will be difficult for the Democrats to overcome , even in a wave year .Hence , if the shutdown results in persistent difficulties for the Republicans , the most likely outcome is a very close split in the House .An actual takeover by the Democrats seems to be possible ( maybe even plausible ) , but not likely .The following is the third and final installment about the impact of minority growth on national politics in the U.S. I have shown that , assuming present political coalitions remain in place , the Republican Party will be a minority party in national politics by 2024 .This last post will examine strategies the Republican Party can pursue to avoid this outcome .There are five identifiable strategies Republicans can take : .Strategy 1 : Stay the course .Upside : The Republican Party can remain a fairly conservative organization , both on economic and social issues .If a backlash against center - left policies envelopes the country , the Republican Party could step in and possibly reestablish the dominance of conservative politics .Downside : With the coming demographic tidal wave , this strategy is almost assured to fail .Moreover , the country is very different from what it was in the late 1960s when the Republican Party pivoted to the right and reaped the benefits of voter wariness with liberalism .The Democratic Party remains too cautious to ever be seen as a fringe leftist party like the one voters turned against in the late 1960s .The overall attitude of moderate suburban voters is the Republican Party -- not the Democratic Party -- has become too extreme .Strategy 2 : Sellout the base and attract suburban voters .Upside : The dominant Republican Party of the 1970s and 1980s was build on well - educated caucasian suburban voters .Sometime in the last twenty years the the party drifted away from this approach .The Democratic Party has become the choice of establishment white voters .Also , the Republican Party is not performing that great among young caucasian voters ( achieving about a 50/50 split ) .If perhaps the Republican Party could moderate its social positions and focus on lower taxes and limited government , it might be able to win 65 % to 70 % of caucasian voters , enough to still win many midwestern and northeastern states .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"55.03102"}

{"text":"He has quickly become a darling of the Republican base .In the beginning , most political watchers dismissed his campaign as a passing fad , a summer fling that would come to an end just as soon as voters returned from summer vacation and really started paying attention to the race .But voters ' feelings toward Trump seem to be holding steady ( and that 's why , as I wrote last week , it may be time to stop dismissing his campaign ) .But a question I 've been concerned with ever since Mr. Trump burst on the scene is , how does the Republican establishment truly feel about him ?Do they , as Reince Priebus , Chairman of RNC says , really believe that a Trump candidacy is \" quite good \" for the party ?Or do they believe that someone who is a \" base candidate \" ruins their chances with minority groups and likely helps to hand the election over to Democrats ?We may be starting to get some clues about their true feelings .The first question asked at the Republican debate a few weeks ago was whether there were any candidates who were unwilling to pledge their support to the eventual Republican nominee and not run as an independent .Trump , during the weeks preceding the debate , routinely said he would not rule out a third - party bid if he were not the Republican nominee .He was , predictably , the only one to raise his hand .Then came a question about Trump 's questionable treatment of women over the years from moderator Megyn Kelly .Trump and Fox News got into a now - famous dust - up over the questions directed at him during the debate .Trump felt that he was being targeted and that the questions came directly from the top , Fox News management .He was probably right .It 's unreasonable to believe that the moderators , with all that was at stake , would be freelancing in that situation .Also , last week we learned that two states , Virginia and North Carolina , were contemplating new requirements for candidates wishing to appear on their primary ballots : that they pledge not to run as third - party candidates in the general election .These moves are largely understood to be targeting Donald Trump .Then last week Fox News and Donald Trump once again got into a bit of a row when Donald Trump tweeted up a firestorm of criticism of Megyn Kelly , prompting Fox News to issue a lengthy statement in her defense and asking Trump for an apology .Megyn Kelly , prior to Trump 's tirade , tweeted out what appeared to be veiled criticisms of Donald Trump 's immigration proposals .Even the most causal followers of Mr. Trump 's know that he is not one to shy away from a fight .Were those tweets meant to goad Trump into another battle ?The question I pose above about how the Republican establishment feels about Donald Trump is worth considering because it reveals a much more interesting dynamic : how the Republican establishment feels about the Republican base .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"57.264122"}

{"text":"Since then , President Obama , who created the commission by executive order , has been content to proceed as if it never existed ... .An Emperor With No Clothes .It pains me to write this article , as our country 's highest representative is making our country a laughing stock to the world and what is even worse , to our most deadly enemies .I can not even mention our president 's name anymore ... .America 's Accelerating Downward Spiral .In the past four decades in the U.S. , every substantial increase in the real price of oil ( meaning in excess of general inflation ) has been followed within a couple of years by a sharp rise in unemployment .So with oil now surging past $ 100 a barrel , what does that suggest about unemployment over the next two years ?And what does it say about President Obama 's economic IQ that the goal of his energy policy has been precisely to raise the price of oil , through cap and trade and restrictions on supply ?The man can be well - spoken , as President Obama undoubtedly is , and still not have the slightest idea what he is talking about .The report shows that the United States is sitting on the largest batch of energy resources on the planet .In fact , these vital fuel sources add up to more than the resources of energy - rich Saudi Arabia , China and Canada combined .Time to Expel the Flunking Education Department .The Wall Street Journal recently uncovered \" billions in bloat , \" confirming what we all suspected : There are hundreds of overlapping , duplicative , and wasteful federal programs .We could probably eliminate half of them and no one would notice .But President Obama nonetheless is piling on the pile , adding more waste .His 38.5 % proposed increase in education spending is just one example of how Obama is proving he is no Ronald Reagan .His bloated budget for the federal Education Department was $ 49.1 billion in 2011 .He wants to hike that to $ 68 billion in 2012 .What is Obama trying to hide ?Small businesses are responsible for over 90 percent of net new jobs , half of GDP , over 90 percent of U.S. exports , and over 90 percent of all innovations .It 's irrefutable .Small businesses are America 's economic backbone , and its chief job creators .Despite these facts , the Obama administration has given virtually none of the stimulus funds to small businesses and continues to give an estimated $ 100 million an hour in small business funds to some of the biggest companies in the world .Since President Obama moved into the White House , some of the firms that have received small business contracts include Boeing , Lockheed Martin , Northrop Grumman , Raytheon , Dell Computer , Xerox , SAIC , General Dynamics , Bechtel and John Deere .Blue Over Green Energy Promises .We know Democrats are philosophically comfortable with using their power to artificially skew demand in favor of their preferred sources of energy .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"57.785137"}
{"text":"So the GOP can say that it wants to and plans to like Hispanics , Asian Americans , unmarried women , and secular youth , but to be believable , merely easing off on its anti - immigration message or going quiet on abortion wo n't do the trick .And if it wants to prove that it cares , it will have to put some real money where its mouth is .What the Party Should Do - and Wo n't .Here 's an idea : how about some \" extraordinary financial gifts \" like the ones Mitt Romney denounced just days after his loss !To really go after the groups it needs , the GOP would have to do the inconceivable : drop the \" entitlement reform \" racket , open the wallet , and reach below a restrictive definition of the middle class .It might , for instance , mean adding more money to Food Stamps , rather than poking fun at the \" food stamp president , \" because a full quarter of Hispanics and 35 percent of Hispanic children are poor .According to the Census , the median income for Hispanics in 2009 was $ 38,039 versus $ 51,861 for whites .The difference is far starker when you compare median net worth : Thanks to the economic crisis , Hispanic households lost 66 percent of their median net worth , falling to $ 6,325 in 2009 , compared to $ 113,149 for white households ( a 16 percent loss ) .Of all the signals emanating from the GOP since Election Day , perhaps the most significant came last week when the socially and fiscally conservative Tea Party kingmaker Jim DeMint voted with his feet .It would undoubtedly mean supporting equal pay for equal work , which the GOP has consistently opposed .It would mean working to make healthcare more affordable for everyone .That 's how you prove you care in politics - and it would also be good for the nation .Similarly , if the Republicans want to be taken seriously as \" defenders \" of the middle class , they would need to do something to defend it from its predators .No , not the lower class but the upper class , the predatory lenders and speculators , the fraudsters , the manipulators of the financial system , the folks who got bailed out while everyone else shouldered the risk .It hardly needs to be said that this is n't likely to happen in any of our lifetimes .So far the only Republican suggestion I 've heard that seems more than ( barely ) cosmetic is for the Party to drop its aversion to gay marriage .That would , at least , be a beneficial , if cynically motivated , move to look less hateful .Hesitation in the Face of Change .It is , of course , theoretically possible that Senator Marco Rubio ( R - Fla . ) could attract enough Hispanic and other voters in 2016 to win the presidency .Provided that the primaries do n't turn into another bizarro battle .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"57.79711"}
{"text":"When , at the end of the campaign , John McCain daubed Obama with the tag of \" redistributionist , \" Obama aides were relieved to find that the label did not change voters ' perception of Obama .\" It did n't work at all , \" Plouffe told me .For the record , McCain aides said that their strategy had nothing to do with Obama 's race , but just was what it was : Obama would confiscate money from the rich and give it to others .McCain saw him as a quasi - socialist who intended to redistribute income .According to research that Belcher 's firm conducted about three weeks before the election , swing voters had an unusually high degree of what he called \" racial aversion .\" Belcher had asked registered white voters whether they strongly agreed , agreed , did not know , disagreed , or strongly disagreed with a series of statements designed to measure attitudes toward black people .( One of those statements : \" I often feel that African Americans are n't as proud and patriotic about this country as I am . \"Another : \" As the result of racial preferences , less qualified minorities too often get hired and promoted . \" )The more the survey respondents agreed with these statements , the more racial animus they presumably held .\" The fluid voters that were left floating out there were voters who had above - average scores on racial aversion , but they were n't behaving strongly like the rest of the voters who held above - average racial aversions , \" Belcher told me .In other words , there was a cohort of voters leaning toward Obama whose racial - aversion scores were comparable to those of voters who were explicit about their prejudice and said they would not vote for Obama .These voters were susceptible to a form of cross - pressure , which Belcher identified as a dissonance between their gut beliefs and their material circumstances .\" Three , four weeks out , part of what was driving that swing electorate to be swing was this cross - pressure , \" he said .\" If you look at their issues , they should be for Barack Obama ; if you look at their racial - aversion scores , they should be for John McCain . \" Two weeks before the election , I visited the Obama campaign headquarters in downtown Chicago and spent the day with various advisers .Exactly four years earlier , John Kerry was flying from urban center to urban center , enlisting the support of Bill Clinton to pump up minority turnout .In some states , internal Kerry polling in mid - October showed Bush overperforming among black voters .Democrats were obsessed with what they called the \" African American piece \" : the quadrennial party efforts to get out the black vote , usually with visits from black leaders and robocalls from Bill Clinton .But on October 22 , 2008 , Obama was in largely white exurban Virginia .That morning , Anita Dunn predicted that Obama would win between 95 and 98 percent of the African American vote .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"57.798737"}

{"text":"Possible Strategy : In its pursuit of the vision of a world - class system of postsecondary education better aligned with national needs , the United States should rely heavily upon market forces shaped by public policy and investment and public - private sector partnerships rather than government regulation .This is consistent with our assumption of constrained public funding and the long and effective decentralization and diversity in American higher education .Moreover such partnerships will be important in identifying changing educational needs ( e.g. , the skills required by a services economy or by globalization ) and restructuring academic programs accordingly .However such a market - focused approach to the achievement of quality and responsiveness will also require enlightened public policies and investment to ensure that the market forces do not distort the broader public purposes of higher education .More specifically , institutions should be provided with the flexibility to compete for students , faculty , and resources from both public and private sources on the basis of quality , price , and value .Both industry and the federal government could provide assistance in collecting and distributing such information .To support American innovation , the nation 's colleges and universities must embrace innovation themselves , by developing new learning pedagogies , academic paradigms , and educational forms that are more responsive to national priorities .This will require a very substantial increase in the support of research and development associated with learning and education by the federal government and higher education institutions .Vision : Leadership in innovation - the transformation of knowledge into products , processes , and services - is critical to competitiveness , long - term productivity growth , and the generation of wealth and hence to United States prosperity and security .Institutions of higher learning must collaborate with industry and government to create a national educational climate and culture that enables innovation to thrive .In fact , we believe that innovation ( in the use of technology , learning paradigms , organization of learning institutions and systems , financing , and governance ) will be both the strongest driver and enabler of change in higher education in the years ahead .Challenge : There is increasing agreement that the prosperity and security of all Americans will depend on our nation 's enduring and evolving capacity to learn , inspire , create , and innovate .Here part of the challenge is the changing nature of innovation itself ; it is far more open ; it spans virtually all disciplines ; and it is increasingly global .And it arises not in the isolated laboratory but in the marketplace , the workplace , the community , and the classroom .It requires the development of new academic disciplines such as services systems management , increasingly multidisciplinary research and instruction across the traditional disciplines , and continual learning opportunities to keep abreast of the fast - changing dynamic nature of work .Clearly , sustaining the nation 's leadership in innovation will require institutions of higher learning capable of embracing innovation as key both to their quality and capacity to serve the changing needs of our society .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"64.07733"}

{"text":"Please note that it is the stage FOLLOWING capitalism .Capitalism has many forms in a mixed economy , with public ( collective ) ownership of various enterprises based upon economic conditions .Limited public ownership does not comprise Marxist socialism , which requires COMPLETE public ownership .When controlled by a police state , however , limited public ownership may become fascism ( \" national socialism \" ) , Marxist socialism , or even \" perfect implementation of collectivist principles \" ( i.e. , communism ) .Limited public ownership occurs at virtually every point on the mixed economy spectrum .MIXED ECONOMIES :Every advocate of greater government economic control might be called a \" socialist , \" but none are Marxist socialists unless they advocate the complete elimination of private enterprise .True ( laissez - faire ) capitalism means zero government control of private enterprise , which means economic anarchy .Neither of these extremes works in the long run .Every successful economy is a mixed economy , existing somewhere on a spectrum between both extremes .Every successful economy is part capitalist and part socialist .They all contain a mix of private and public ownership , and they all have some government control of private enterprise .The only relevant question is \" WHERE on this spectrum can we achieve the greatest success ? \" The rise of Asian economies , with their varying degrees of centralized planning , proves that economic planning helps economic development .ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCTS : Both laissez faire capitalism and true communism are artificial constructs , as impossible to sustain as cold fusion .Every successful society requires private enterprise regulated by public policy , regardless of Ayn Rand 's fantasies .Extremists on either fringe are equally delusional .In some ways regulation is a necessary evil like body fat : too much or too little are both lethal .The normal tendency is to add layers with age .The challenge is to find the level that will produce the optimum outcome , all things considered .Unless someone advocates the complete replacement of capitalism with collectivism , they do not truly advocate socialism or communism .To accuse them of either , when they have not explicitly advocated as much themselves , suggests either unfamiliarity with mixed economies or intellectual dishonesty .Even George W. Bush and John McCain were accused of advocating socialism based upon their support of 2008 bailout legislation .ARE MIXED ECONOMIES \" SOCIALIST \" ?The bottom line is simple .If you consider any variation of a mixed economy , including ANY public ownership or regulation of industry to be \" socialism , \" then the United States and ALL other economies are \" socialist .\" The debate is over , because by that definition we have been \" socialist \" since the 18th century .If you only consider complete collectivism to be \" socialism , \" according to Marxist theory , then no successful economy is actually \" socialist .\" The closest to a Marxist socialist economy is the economic basket case , North Korea .If you consider socialism to occur at some other point on the spectrum between unregulated capitalism and Marxist socialism , then any such point would be arbitrary .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"76.737"}

As a result , our society splits into two camps , those who \" get \" these connected generations and those who do not or will not .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"81.44794"}

Bush captured 44 % of the Latino vote in 2004 , while Mitt Romney captured just 27 % in 2012 .The report points out that America is changing demographically and those changes tilt the presidential election playing field in the Democratic Party 's direction , and if Republicans want to remain competitive they will have to \" engage \" minorities and show them \" sincerity .But there are some Republicans who disagree with that strategy .While they 're certainly not against making the tent bigger , they feel the party 's main priority should be energizing the base .Ted Cruz , for example , is fond of pointing out that whenever Republicans nominate moderates they lose ( see Bob Dole , John McCain and Mitt Romney ) , and whenever they nominate true conservatives they win ( see Richard Nixon and Ronald Regan ) .The thinking goes , true conservatives drive Republicans out to the polls and to election victories .It 's a choice that can be summarized in this way : turnout vs. reachout .Should the party focus on energizing the base in an effort to get it to turn out in big numbers and vote on Election Day ?Or should it concern itself more with reaching out to non - traditional sources of support in an effort to broaden the party 's appeal ?","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"84.25325"}

'\" It 's a minor legal point , but critics say it could have big implications that could prevent teachers from teaching sexually explicit books and implicate everyday classroom flirtations .Historically , most colleges - including the University of Montana - have defined sexual harassment as conduct that creates a hostile educational environment .As recently as 2012 , the Department of Education upheld the \" hostile environment \" standard in agreements with institutions like Yale University .Under current definitions , a \" hostile environment \" involves behavior of a sexual nature that is more than just \" unwelcome .\" It must be \" sufficiently severe or pervasive as to disrupt or undermine a person 's ability to participate in or receive the benefits , services , or opportunities of the University , including unreasonably interfering with a person 's work or educational performance .\" The Obama Administration believes that should still be the criteria for identifying a hostile environment .But they want a broader definition of sexual harassment to encourage more incident reporting .Separating the definitions of \" sexual harassment \" and \" a hostile environment , \" says another Justice Department official , encourages victims to let the proper authorities know about questionable behavior .Conservative politicians , civil liberties advocates , and academics have criticized the broadening of the definition of harassment .On June 26th , Arizona Senator John McCain sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder questioning the Obama Administration 's powers to unilaterally emphasize the broader definition of harassment .McCain also asked if \" a student giving another student a Valentine 's Day Card \" or \" a student listening to music that contains content of a sexual nature overheard by others \" could constitute harassment under the new standard .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"98.28383"}

Zeidler , former Mayor of Milwaukee , for President and Quinn Brisben , a Chicago school teacher , for Vice President .In 1980 the Socialist ticket was David McReynolds , a pacifist on the staff of the War Resisters League , and Sister Diane Drufenbrock of the Order of St. Francis .One outcome of that campaign was the Party 's recognition by the FEC as a political party nationwide in scope .In 1984 there was an ill - fated attempt to form a coalition with the Citizen 's Party ; when it failed the time was too late to mount a Socialist Party campaign .In 1988 the party chose again to nominate a Presidential slate .Willa Kenoyer , a journalist , and Ron Ehrenreich , a credit union officer and university lecturer , were chosen as the candidates for President and Vice - President .In 1992 , the SP nominated Quinn Brisben for President and union organizer Bill Edwards for Vice - President .Sadly , Edwards died suddenly during the race , whereupon the party chose author and playwright Barbara Garson as the new Vice - Presidential candidate .In 1996 the SP nominated activist and special education teacher Mary Cal Hollis for President and author and economics professor Eric Chester for Vice - President .Due in part to frustration with the free - trade and anti - labor success of the Democratic President Bill Clinton , the end of the Cold War and the advent of the Internet , this election saw an influx of newer , younger members .This wave of new activists brought the party to a size and level of activity not seen since before \" Realignment .As the Socialist Party celebrates its centennial this year , new members and activists are coming on board to help build a new vision of democratic socialism for the 21st century .The SP is slowly but surely regaining \" party \" status in states across the country .We know it 's not easy , but it never has been .And just think , without us , things would only be worse .The struggle continues , and if you see yourself as part of that struggle , for socialism and democracy in our time , we invite you to join us .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"101.35709"}

Establish Global Communist Government 3 .Profit .Using his mad skills at terrorism , Big Mo was able to kill literally millions of Jews and still found time to bang his fine ass wife , who was as history has proven , just 6 months old when their marriage was consumated .Unfortunately though he was unable to finish step 2 , as Communism would n't be invented for another 1000 years .History would have to wait for this guy to come along : .Karl Marx was also a genius like his predecessor Mohammad .His greatest contribution was The Communist Manifesto , which in a nutshell set out our aims as such : .Kill all the Jews 2 . Establish Global Communist Government 3 .Profit .Unfortunately Marx was unable to commit to these plans when he discovered he was himself , a Jew .Despondent , he retired from public life and went back to his original career , selling Che Guevara T - Shirts to students .Our next legend in the history of Socialism did n't have any trouble killing Jews .Adolf Hitler not only killed more Jews than anyone ever ( at least 600 billion by conservative estimates ) , he also started a massive war to finally establish a global communist government just as Mohammad had intended .Like his predecessors he also outlined his aims in a book of his own , Mein Kampf which in a nutshell read like this : .Kill all the Jews 2 . Establish Global Communist Government 3 .Profit .Unfortunately for Adolf the Jews were firmly in control of America by this point and with the immense monetary resources of Jew - gold , the USA was able to defeat the Nazis single handedly .The baton was then passsed to Saddam Hussein .After tricking American Jews into giving him tonnes of Jew - gold and guns , Saddam set about ridding the world of capitalists .His first step was to invade Kuwait .When he got there though he discovered , to his dismay , that there were no Jews in Kuwait .The US responded mostly with laughter and smart bombs .Saddam went back to his sand - pit in a huff .Not to be outdone though , he then enacted Plan B. This involved getting his right - hand man Osama Bin Laden to organise the infamous 9/11 attacks , which would have been a huge success had someone not tipped off the Jews yet again .In the end no Jews died and the revolution the attacks were intended to instigate , never materialised .But there was still Plan C.

{"text":"In 1956 the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Federation reunited , under pressure from the Socialist International ( with which both groups were affiliated ) .A right - wing group in the SDF opposed the merger , and established the Democratic Socialist Federation .As of 1957 the SP - SDF was pervaded by a strong sense that the time had arrived to start over and rebuild a major radical party in America .Internally it was the same kind of party it had always been - ecumenical and democratic - and it still commanded a significant reservoir of public sympathy .Many in the Party felt that now , with the McCarthy era over and gone , it would be possible to recruit members to a revitalized revolutionary democratic Socialist Party .By this time , the Communist Party had lost a number of members over its uncritical allegiance to the Soviet government , and these were among those the Party actively attempted to recruit .In addition , unity discussions were launched with two groups believed to be friendly , the Jewish Labor Bund and the Independent Socialist League .The Bund is an international organization of anti - Zionist , non - religious , democratic socialist Jews .The ISL was a Trotskyite splinter group founded and led by Max Shachtman , with about 400 members .In 1958 the ISL dissolved , and its members joined the SP - SDF .This ended any hope of further mergers , since Shachtman 's intention was to attain control of the Socialist Party .Almost at once a faction fight erupted over the concept of \" realignment . \"Shachtman and his lieutenant , Michael Harrington , argued that what America needed was n't a third party , but a meaningful second party .The realignment supporters said that in sixty years the Socialist Party had failed to bring labor into the Party , and in fact kept losing their labor sympathizers ( such as the Reuther brothers ) because they saw they could do more within the Democratic Party .It was also argued that in view of restricted ballot access the Democratic primaries were a better forum for electoral activity than Socialist candidacies .But the basic argument was an appeal to traditional Marxism : Labor is the motor for social change , labor will not come to the Socialist Party , therefore the Socialist Party must go to labor - which means going into the Democratic Party .Many of those who later would form the Debs Caucus initially bought this reasoning , but they understood it as meaning that when becoming active in the Democratic Party one should do so openly as a Socialist .The suppression of Socialist identity was no part of the thinking of the bulk of the membership .From its inception , the Socialist Party had opposed anything that smacked of manipulative politics , seeing it as directly contradictory to the goal of raising the consciousness and self - confidence of the working class .There is no doubt that the realignment strategy was successful within its own terms .Former SP labor people like A. Philip Randolph rejoined the Party , and many new people of this type were recruited during this period .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"104.30049"}
