'Many intending Yes voters will agree with that statement , viewing independence not only as a way of addressing Scotland 's perceived democratic deficit , but also as an opportunity for democratic renewal . \" In Scotland , the people are sovereign \" .This is the foundation of the interim constitution that has been published in a draft bill by the Scottish government .In the event of a yes vote , this would provide the basis for the Scottish state during the first years of independence , pending the adoption of a permanent constitution some time after 2016 .Last Friday , I took part in a Scottish Constitutional Futures Forum event at Edinburgh University , entitled 1 00 Days to Go : Four Nations and a Union .The aim was to explore the impact of the independence referendum from the perspective of the United Kingdom and each of its constituent nations .The question I sought to answer was ' has the UK had a good referendum ?

{"text":"I suspect that there are very few people in Scotland , other than dyed - in - the - wool Unionists , who believe that the Vow has been , or will be , honoured .With the Vow , the Unionists offered a deal to the Scottish electorate , Devo Max or something close to it in return for a No vote .However , as soon as they got the result they wanted - quite possibly only because of the Vow - they reneged on it .In my view , that is sufficient reason to regard the No vote as invalid and to demand a new referendum - sooner rather than later .These two axes are not the only ones which might be used to classify political parties .One could attempt to rate parties on the basis of their honesty .In government , do they implement their pre - election pledges , or at least attempt to do so ?Do they act on behalf of the electorate as a whole , as they would claim , or for a small part of it ?Can their policies be influenced by MP 's own financial interests or by money , whether as political donations , lucrative directorships and consultancies , or outright bribes ?As a second axis for a graph , one could use Idealism - Opportunism .I will discuss this by describing the hypothetical end members of this scale ; any real party will show some mixture of idealism and opportunism .An entirely idealistic party would have a definite vision of the society it wished to create , and all its policies would be geared towards achieving that society .If those policies were not popular with the electorate , it would not abandon them , but would seek to persuade voters of their merits .An idealistic party might be good or bad , depending on its goals ; the Nazis had their ideals but , tragically , those ideals were evil .An idealistic party , like a religion , can inspire zeal and even fanaticism amongst its followers .This is probably why Wikipedia lists six current UK political parties with the word \" Communist \" as part of their title ; what might have been one minor party is fragmented into complete insignificance .A purely opportunistic party would have only one ideal , namely that it should form the government whenever possible , so that its leading MPs might have the chance to enjoy the prestige , perks and privileges ( legitimate or otherwise ) of ministerial office .Its policies would be chosen entirely on the basis of their likely popularity with the electorate .Blatantly obvious opportunism is unlikely to appeal to voters , or to inspire ordinary party members to go out and campaign for the party ; it would have to be disguised ( perhaps as populism ) , and hence an opportunistic party would also be a significantly dishonest one .In opposition , an opportunistic party may well decide that their failure to win the most recent election proves that the winning party had the most attractive policies .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.47937"}

{"text":"The first is that it would be selfish ; there are millions of people in England who do not support the Tories and do not deserve to suffer the consequences of Tory ( or even New Labour ) government .The second reason is that I suspect that the prospects of actually achieving independence , once there is a clear majority in favour of it , may be better with a Real Labour government at Westminster .What I believe is as follows .It is very unlikely that Cameron or any other Tory Prime Minister will sign any similar agreement , knowing that this time a Yes vote is probable - if it is not probable , the Scottish Government is unlikely to want a referendum .Either the Scottish Government will be prevented from holding a new referendum , or Westminster will not recognise a Yes vote as valid .A UDI would be a scary prospect for many people , and support for one , as a last resort , is only likely to go above 50 % if there is truly massive support for independence , and a great deal of anger directed at Westminster .My guess is that , since Labour can no longer rely on Scotland returning mostly Labour MPs , a Real Labour government would be easier to deal with .Real Labour would not renew Trident , and would not have the same need to keep hold of Faslane .Real Labour is less likely to look back on the British Empire with nostalgia , and to treat Scotland as the last remnant of that Empire , as England 's last colony .The third reason to hope for a revival of Real Labour south of the border is that , should Scotland become independent , England would be a better neighbour under Real Labour than under any neo - liberal regime .It will be easier for the Scottish Government to implement socially just policies if England is doing something similar .For example , if the top rate of income tax and benefits were both significantly higher in Scotland than in England , there might be an exodus of rich people from Scotland ( for tax purposes at any rate ) and an influx of unemployed and disabled people .I am glad that Jeremy Corbyn is the new Labour leader ; I see it as an encouraging sign that the neo - liberal tide might perhaps be about to ebb .What it will mean for Scotland , and the cause of Scottish independence , I do not know , but I am cautiously optimistic that it might open up new opportunities , especially if the Tories start quarrelling amongst themselves over EU membership .In a recent radio programme , it was suggested that in the nineteenth century , while many other countries were adopting formal constitutions , people in England were so proud of Magna Carta as a sort of proto - constitution that they thought that Britain did not need anything else .The speculation prior to the election about what might have happened if the result had been a hung parliament highlights the unsatisfactory nature of the UK 's uncodified constitution , key parts of which are are mere conventions .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"79.053"}
{"text":"It will be a sobering moment for the House of Commons .But transforming parliament must mean going much further than even our recent root and branch changes to the parliamentary allowances system .It was right to take away from MPs their ability to set and police their pay and expenses , and so self regulation has given way to statutory regulation by people independent of MPs .But we are also determined to do all that is necessary to restore trust and to ensure that all MPs , like the vast majority do already , concentrate on serving the public and not themselves .And that is why , in grave situations where financial impropriety has been proven , but where parliament itself has failed to act , we are proposing the ultimate power of recall by the people .But , in the new politics , it is also essential that MPs are accountable to their constituents and that their mandate is clear and strong .The first past the post system maintains a clear link to a member of parliament 's constituency and it has usually given governments a clear mandate to govern .The alternative vote system has the advantage of maintaining the benefit of a strong constituency link ; allowing MPs to be not simply policy makers , but also community leaders , community organisers , and thestrongest champions for neighbourhoods they know and love .But if the people decide to back the alternative vote , it also offers voters increased choice with the chance to express preferences for as many of the candidates as they wish .It means that each elected MP will have the chance to be elected with much broader support from their constituency , not just those who picked them as their first choice .In short it offers a system where the British people can , if they so choose , be more confident that their MP truly represents them , while at the same time remaining directly accountable to them .Any change will not be for the forthcoming election .I will argue and campaign for such a change .And because this is a major change in our democratic arrangements , we are today publishing the key clauses we are tabling as part of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill .That bill will have the effect of introducing the primary legislation required to hold a referendum on moving to the alternative vote system , which we intend should be held before the end of October 2011 .And in moving towards a more democratic form of election , I hope too that we can move towards making parliament itself better reflect the people it serves .When I entered parliament in 1983 , the House of Commons was an all white chamber .There were only 23 women .Just think - a chamber where 50 per cent of the population had only 3 per cent of the representation .A black woman did not speak at the Commons despatch box until late last year .That is unacceptable - and it must change .The Equality Bill is extending all - women shortlists until 2030 - and I 'm proud that already three in every five of those candidates selected for the Labour Party in seats we currently hold are women .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"79.183075"}

{"text":"Misunderstandings about the Singapore Constitution .The outcome was not in the least bit surprising to me .The Constitution is quite clear -- the President has no discretion on clemency applications , but is instead required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .To my mind , this judgment is entirely correct in law .Understanding this better requires a little trip back in legal history .Singapore started off with a constitutional presidency -- the President was the head of state , but was a nominal one and was really a ceremonial post .This was consistent with Singapore being a parliamentary democracy in the Westminster tradition , where executive power lay wholly with the elected government of the day .If you will , the President was the republic 's equivalent to the constitutional monarchy in the UK ( i.e. the Queen of England ) .Under this approach , the President ( just like the Queen ) has no discretion and must act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .A constitutional crisis ensues if the President fails or declines for any reason to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .But this changed with the Elected Presidency amendments in 1991 .They introduced a hybrid approach whereby the President was to be elected , with some veto powers over executive decisions .These veto powers may be exercised by the President in his / her sole discretion , i.e. the President does not need to follow the advice of the Cabinet on such matters .But on all matters , the President continues to be bound by the advice of the Cabinet .Article 21 of the Singapore Constitution sets out this position .It lists those decisions where the President may use his / her own discretion .All other decisions must be made in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .It should be clear from Article 21 , that the power to grnat a pardon under Article 22 is one where the President is legally bound to follow the decision of the Cabinet .None of this is actually controversial .When I studied this in law school ( and my graduating class is having our 10-year reunion tomorrow , so this was 12 - 13 years ago ) , this was taught as a straightforward fact and there was no controversy on this .Indeed , even the Wikipedia entry on the President of Singapore ( current last edit being on 18 July 2010 ) correctly correctly describes how the powers of the President may be exercised .I want to be clear that I am talking about the law as it is , i.e. applying a \" positive \" approach to the law here .I am not , in this post , talking about what the law should be ( i.e. applying a \" normative \" approach ) .Finally , I think it has to be said that the courts have been very fair to Yong Vui Kong ever since the appeal process began in earnest .They have given Yong and his lawyer M.

{"text":"( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution ) .I believe that there are three major problems which arise from the uncodified nature of the UK 's constitution .The first is the inclusion within it of conventions which have somehow developed over the centuries .A convention is like a gentlemen 's agreement , or a voluntary code of conduct ; it is useful just as long as everyone involved abides by it , even if they only do so for fear of the damage to their reputation should they not do so .Constitutional conventions are not , and can not be , enforced by courts of law .The primary reason for this , according to the Supreme Court of Canada in its 1981 Patriation Reference , is that , \" They are generally in conflict with the legal rules which they postulate and the courts are bound to enforce the legal rules .\" More precisely , the conventions make certain acts , which would be permissible under a straightforward reading of the law , impermissible in practice .The court ruled that this conflict between convention and law means that no convention , no matter how well - established or universally accepted , can \" crystallize \" into law , unless the relevant parliament or legislature enacts a law or constitutional amendment codifying the convention .This principle is regarded as authoritative in a number of other jurisdictions , including the UK .( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_%28political_custom%29 ) .One significant convention is that the monarch always gives the royal assent to any bill which has been passed by Parliament .The last bill to be refused royal assent was one to arm the Scottish militia , which Queen Anne refused to sign in 1708 .Yet legally the Queen could still veto legislation by withholding assent ( with the formula \" La Reyne s'avisera \" ) .If her successor is faced with a bill which he strongly disagrees with , will he submit to the convention , or will he risk provoking a constitutional crisis by responding \" Le Roy s'avisera \" ?A second disadvantage of the UK 's uncodified constitution is that it is quite difficult to know exactly what it really is .There are some Acts of Parliament which clearly form part of the constitution , one of the most important being the Bill of Rights 1689 .The Bill of Rights lays down limits on the powers of the monarch and sets out the rights of Parliament , including the requirement for regular parliaments , free elections , and freedom of speech in Parliament .A separate but similar document , the Claim of Right Act 1689 , applies in Scotland .( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689 ) .Obviously there are other acts which might be considered as part of the constitution , such as the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011 , the numerous Representation of the People Acts and Reform Acts , and of course the infamous Acts of Union .However , even where an Act of Parliament contains some matters of constitutional importance , it may also contain provisions which are clearly not relevant to the constitution , or have been superceded by later legislation , or simply rendered obsolete by changing circumstances .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"82.6015"}

{"text":"Its replacement , in the form of a constitutional declaration , was announced on Facebook by Egypt 's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ( SCAF ) , the country 's interim military leadership .Almost two weeks earlier , on March 19 , voters had approved eight amendments to the suspended 1971 constitution in a referendum - with the implication that the newly amended constitution would be returned to force .With significant procedural and substantive implications , the constitutional declaration is a complicated and problematic document .Egypt 's transition from authoritarian rule is not necessarily endangered , but a more inclusive and coherent approach from the SCAF would have given Egyptians greater confidence in this crucial and still very fragile process .Recent developments surrounding the declaration 's issuance indicate that : .The constitutional declaration comes after conflicting and confusing signals from the SCAF about the transitional process , and these procedural difficulties betray an improvised and opaque way to making fundamental decisions about Egypt 's future ; .The SCAF followed an odd pattern of selecting clauses from the 1971 constitution to include in its declaration , and the result will be ambiguity in the operation of critical institutions and of constitutional protections during the transition period ; .While some steps in the transition process have been identified , along with timetables , others remain unspecified .Procedural Incoherence and Inconsistency .As it developed the constitutional declaration , the SCAF consulted some Egyptian leaders on an ad - hoc basis .The SCAF ignored calls to set up a \" presidential council \" or any formal means of bringing together various political forces to oversee the process .A \" national dialogue \" was finally initiated , but only after the constitutional declaration had already been written and was placed under the authority of Egypt 's civilian cabinet rather than the SCAF .The dialogue has therefore been unable to address constitutional issues .Egyptians were not even told who had drafted the declaration ; it was presented as a sort of gift by a patriotic military leadership dedicated to protecting Egypt and the principles of the revolution .And when criticism of the closed procedure arose , SCAF members expressed frustration and wounded pride that they did not receive the gratitude they thought they deserved .The declaration process was not merely opaque - it was also confusing and even incoherent .After voters were asked on March 19 to approve amendments to the suspended 1971 constitution - which they did - they were then told the constitution was actually void and that the \" amendments \" would become part of a new constitutional declaration .Among the amendments voters approved was the abrogation of Article 179 , dealing with terrorism and national security .Thus , the referendum itself implied that only the people , acting through the referendum process , had the power to delete a constitutional provision .But when the declaration was announced on March 30 , Egyptians found that scores of other articles not mentioned in the referendum were not included , meaning the SCAF - acting on its own and outside the process it had suggested was necessary - had effectively tossed them out .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"87.037994"}

{"text":"The exception was of course Wales , which following the repeal of Gladstone 's 1881 Sunday Closing ( Wales ) Act in 1961 saw a number of plebiscites on a County by County basis over the controversial issue of Sunday drinking .It took 35 years of going to the polls before all areas of Wales allowed their public houses to open on a Sunday .Since Harold Wilson 's intervention we have had a number of other votes : in 1979 to decide on devolution proposals in Wales and Scotland and again in 1997 to have a second go at similar , though much watered - down proposals .Although both of these referendums produced positive outcomes , the legislative bodies that emerged were not equal in their responsibilities and powers .Scotland was given a Parliament that could pass laws and vary taxes .In Wales we were offered the administration of the £ 7 billion budget previously held by the Welsh Office and the opportunity to pass secondary legislation , effectively to tinker with the UK agenda and UK Acts of Parliament .In my view the uneven nature of the powers offered to Wales and Scotland was one of the reasons why the result here was so close .It initiated a debate that has dominated Welsh politics ever since .How we got where we are lies in the politics behind why referendums are held in the first place .As Harold Wilson and then Jim Callaghan illustrated , the abandonment of representative politics in favour of a popular vote on specific legislative proposals happens when the ruling party can not agree amongst itself or fears that the issue will rip apart their political unity .So , rather than argue it out in Parliament or party conference they agree to let the people resolve the issue for them .In the case of the Welsh referendum it got even more complicated .That is because the Labour Party in Wales could not agree on the question .As a result the proposals put before the Welsh people were significantly watered down .These internal Labour politics also limited the terms of the debate on how this could be put right .A Commission set up by the Labour - Liberal Democrat Coalition Government in 2000 - 2003 recommended that Wales should have the same law - making powers as Scotland ; however that was not acceptable to Labour MPs and the wider party in Wales .As a result when the Government of Wales Act 2006 was passed it contained a bizarre mechanism by which the Assembly draws down primary law - making powers as and when it needed them .The precise method by which this occurs is through a legislative competence order ( LCO ) .Essentially , the Welsh Assembly draws up a statutory instrument defining what powers it wants to exercise .The total cost of this process is about £ 2 million a year out of the Assembly 's budget , on top of the time taken by AMs and MPs in scrutinising the orders .The total time taken from start to finish for a non - controversial LCO is about 4 to 6 months .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"88.74176"}

{"text":"Yes , in your constituency 67.19 % did not vote for the winner .But even more people did n't vote for any of the other candidates , so it 's by no means obvious that a different result would have been fairer .The Hampstead and Kilburn result gives a perfect illustration of another reason why I dislike preferential voting .Sorry , but this one will take a bit of explaining : - .If we had used AV in May 2010 , and if second preferences had been distributed according to the YouGov poll of 4 - 5 May , then Glenda Jackson very likely still would have won .However , if the election had been re - run seven weeks later , with each candidate getting the same number of first preferences , but with second preferences now distributed according to the YouGov poll of 27 - 28 June , then it 's very likely the Tory candidate would have won .I 've pointed out before that second preferences are extremely volatile ; and one of the reasons for this volatility is that a large proportion of the electorate change their second preferences according to the relationships between the various parties .The two YouGov polls I referred to show this very starkly .For example , I as a Labour voter would be very well inclined to give my second preference to the Lib Dems if I thought there was a good chance of a Labour - LD coalition .If however I thought that a vote for the Lib Dems would simply prop up the existing Tory - led coalition , I would be far less likely to put my 2 next to the Lib Dem candidate .You see the problem here ?The evidence shows that second preferences depend on a very large degree to relationships between parties , and - here 's the real crux of it - voters may have NO IDEA what those relationships are likely to be at the time they cast their vote .Second preference votes therefore become a gamble ; and I do n't think elections should be about gambling .@Ben Remember in the last election when the Lib Dem leaflet featured those wonderful bar charts pointing out how Labour had no chance here and how only the Lib Dems could kick that Tory out ?No doubt that Labour 's vote was squeezed , many left wing voters tactically voting for the Lib Dems as their best bet at kicking out the Tories .Under AV , such \" squeezing \" tactics would n't work , giving Labour a fighting chance of building support and breaking through in that constituency .But you 're right - if the majority of the voters in a constituency are right wing , AV will give a right wing result .But atleast it will allow more choice as to WHICH right wing candidate you get in your constituency - I think you 'll agree that some are preferable to others ! @Stuart You could make the same argument against any kind of vote .The issue you bring up is a lack of information about how a party will act after the election and how that affects your informed choice .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"89.359116"}

{"text":"I 'd say that s about right .Surely the Alternative Vote is merely advancing democratic representation just as much as enlarging the electorate so that all men and women had a vote .Until the emergence of the Labour party at the start of the 20th century nearly every constituency contest was a straight Liberal v Conservative fight .In Wales , for example , in 1910 only Swansea had a three cornered contest .With straight fights every winning M.P. had 50 % or more of the vote .Today with no constituency enjoying a two candidate contest and many having a multitude of candidates very few have the backing of 50 % of their voting constituents .THAT is one reason why AV goes part of the way to restoring a situation in which in each constituency a majority of the electors will have a hand in electing their M.P. .My main point is that I think the headline to your article is considerably overstated , for the reasons I outlined above .Staring defeat in the face implies that the campaign is almost lost for the Yes Campaign , whereas I believe the referenda is wide wide open .To me , there is a large difference between the two positions we 've taken .I think we should remember that this is going to be a marathon , not a sprint and the finish is still a long way off .To those who do want to do something , I 'd say do get involved in the Take Back Parliament Groups that seem to be springing up all over the place ( or the No Campaign , if you 're on that side of the argument ) .I can explain that .Libral Democrats are the only people who support AV or any other sort of electoral reform .And the reason is simple : AV , STV and all the other bad ideas would benefit the Liberal party , and only the Liberal party .That is why Liberals have supported proportional representation for as long as anyone can remember , and why they are now supporting AV now .Apart from the fact that Liberals would gain seats , perhaps someone could explain to me the merits of AV .I should be grateful .Dear Chas , PR would also benefit UKIP , BNP and would have benefited the British Communist Party .The Liberals were not vocally supporting proportional representation when I was a child .I do not support AV , but I wish to put forward VALID arguments when I am discussing it .OK , I should have said that the Liberal party is the only party with any MPs that would benefit from electoral reform , and AV would not be of any use to the BNP or UKIP .Also , do you really want a system that lets nutters like the BNP win seats ?In some countries it is the fruit - cake parties which hold parliament to ransom as coalitions need to include them to form governments .There may be some people in the Labour party who support AV or other electoral reform , but largely because they are a ) stupid , b ) destructive , c ) living under the misapprehension that it would benefit them .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"98.88484"}
