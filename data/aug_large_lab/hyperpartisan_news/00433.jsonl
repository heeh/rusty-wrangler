Bush .Blocking government enforcement powers .The same budget bill contains dozens of antiworker riders to prevent the government from enforcing new regulations to improve worker protections .The NLRB introduced the rule to modernize the union - election process because the current process allows for manipulation of the timing of elections - leading to delays that can help cause elections to never occur .Thirty - five percent of the time that workers file a petition for an election , the election does not end up happening .The NLRB has scheduled a vote today on a portion of the rule - but the budget bill and standalone legislation authored by Rep. John Kline ( R - MN ) would prevent the agency from instituting these changes .The House is scheduled to vote on Kline 's bill today .House Republicans also passed a bill that would gut the NLRB 's enforcement power in cases where a company moves operations or eliminates work to punish workers that exercise their legally protected rights .Under the bill it would still be against the law to retaliate against workers , but the NLRB would no longer have much power to do anything about it .House Republicans are even using congressional subpoena power to stall implementation of new regulations and ongoing enforcement investigations .This represented the first time since 1940 that the NLRB has been subjected to a congressional subpoena , according to acting general counsel for the NLRB , Lafe Soloman .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"42.463142"}

{"text":"As well , the president 's appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were delayed by Republican opposition in the Senate and by the administration 's own unwillingness , first , to press for confirmation in a timely fashion and then to give recess appointments to the NLRB members .As a result , the five - member NLRB continues to limp along with just two members ( one Democrat , one Republican ) , unable to rule on any contentious issues .That said , the NLRB had few cases involving current organizing campaigns in 2009 , chiefly because there was precious little organizing going on .Last year , unions devoted their energy mainly to the legislative battles for labor - law reform , stimulus legislation , and health - care reform .They pressed the administration for executive branch rules changes that may make the task of organizing workers less Herculean and that will better the lot of low - wage workers whether or not they belong to a union -- efforts that may soon bear some fruit .The larger unions also were busy planning major organizing campaigns they would undertake if their reform bill , the Employee Free Choice Act , passed .Now , in the mordant words of one leading organizer , \" we 're trying to figure out what Plan B is .\" This is hardly what unions expected when they plunged more than a quarter - billion dollars into their efforts to help elect Barack Obama and other Democrats in the summer and fall of 2008 .The unions were the only element within the Democratic coalition able to mount a credible campaign for Obama in the sector of the electorate where his support was weakest : the white working class .Focusing on such relatively heavily unionized swing states as Ohio , Michigan , and Pennsylvania , they accomplished their mission : Unionized white men backed Obama by an 18 percent margin , even as nonunionized white men opposed him by 16 percent .The entire industrial Midwest ended up in Obama 's column .EFCA , which Obama had pledged to support , is designed to address a number of distinct shortcomings in existing labor law .Discharging a worker involved in an organizing campaign , or threatening to close or move a business if workers vote for a union , for instance , are forbidden by the current law , but the penalties are negligible , and such threats and firings have become routine .Employers can also delay elections for months if not years and compel their workers to attend one - on - one anti - union meetings with their supervisors .The bill passed the House last summer , then went to the Senate where , like all substantive legislation in the past year , it hit a wall .Tom Harkin , the Iowa liberal who chairs the Senate 's Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , quickly found that he could n't rally all 60 Senate Democrats for the bill that had passed the House .Working with five other Senate Democrats from across the party 's ideological spectrum , he developed a compromise proposal that abandoned the card - check proposal in favor of expedited elections and greatly enhanced penalties for employer misconduct .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"45.47824"}

Beck , the Supreme Court ruled that these nonunion workers were entitled to withhold whatever portion of their fees went for purposes other than collective bargaining .President Clinton rescinded the mandate , but the second President Bush quickly reinstated his father 's order .By themselves the Beck notices wo n't cause a significant drain on union coffers .But conservative activists want new executive orders and regulations to give Beck sharper teeth .The most important of these would dramatically tighten the standards for the annual financial reports that unions large and small must file with the Labor Department .\" More disclosure , \" one prominent anti - union activist told me .\" That 's the best way we see to get the Beck decision enforced . \"The Landrum - Griffin Act of 1959 stipulates that unions must file reports on where they spend their money , but many of the specifics regarding just what must be reported are left to Labor Department regulations .Antilabor activists would like to ramp up the level of detail required in these reports -- preferably modeling them on the disclosure filings that corporations must make to the Securities and Exchange Commission and having them follow , as closely as possible , the categories outlined in Beck .Union officials say such requirements would prove burdensome -- especially to the roughly 95 percent of union locals that have no full - time professional staff .But the real goal here is to strengthen Beck .Anti - union activists plan to use these detailed disclosures in organized , well - funded efforts to get nonunion workers to withhold fees and union members to resign from their unions .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"50.945755"}

Beck .Under Beck , an employee should be able to limit his or her payment to the union to his or her share of the costs of representation .The principle behind Beck is that workers should not be forced to pay for union lobbying or political work unrelated to the employer / employee relationship .Why is n't Beck enough ?Even in exercising Beck rights , an employee is still obligated to pay a union for services that the employee does not want .In addition , Beck rights have proven difficult to secure , as the union controls all the records needed to determine what employees should pay .Getting an accurate accounting often requires lengthy litigation .Ca n't workers get rid of a union that 's doing a bad job ?That 's easier said than done .Once a union is certified , it is difficult for employees to remove it .Decertification elections must wait until a contract expires and because of forced dues and fees , unions have large amounts of funds to fight attempts to remove them .This is one reason why most employees in unionized firms have NEVER actually voted in an election to certify the union that represents them .The union is simply entrenched and therefore has the ability to act in a manner that may be more beneficial to union leaders than to union members .Union officials in right - to - work states know that if they lose touch with their members , those members may simply start withholding dues and fees .This keeps the union more immediately accountable to the workers it represents .But do n't workers benefit from having a union ?Should n't they be willing to pay for it ?It 's not that simple .A union can hurt workers too .When a young worker is laid off or passed over for a promotion because of seniority , does he really benefit from the union contract ?An ineffective or unwise union can cost workers dearly .It 's naive to assume that all workers come out ahead from union representation .And once you account for that , the whole case against right - to - work basically evaporates .What has changed that makes right - to - work an issue now ?Michigan is in an economic crisis .Between 2002 and 2010 the state lost 14 percent of its jobs .States with RTW have proven attractive to companies desiring to locate in an area , and Michigan workers could really use the jobs those companies might provide .WORKPLACE .What would change at my workplace ?","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"57.928406"}

Hart Research Associates Poll .And 63 percent of working Americans reported that they joined together with co - workers to solve a workplace problem in 1997-the last year that question was asked - according to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press .In recent years the NLRB has protected the rights of nonunion workers to engage in \" protected concerted activity \" to improve wages , benefits , and working conditions in a number of prominent cases .In these cases , nonunion workers have filed charges against their employer and asked the NLRB to investigate .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"58.871887"}

{"text":"The main principle of the bill was that all federally regulated workers should have the right to a free secret ballot vote when deciding to certify or decertify a union .The card check system that had apparently been in place for federally regulated industries required 50 % plus one of workers ' union membership cards for union certification .This system was open to co - workers and other interested parties potentially pressuring employees into signing union cards .Rather than an automatic certification of a union process , the previous bill required a 50 % plus one majority of votes cast in a secret ballot to support certification at a meeting for certification or decertification .The principle behind this is similar to what we all undergo here in a general election .Just as the secret ballot of a general election represents the voice of each elector , a secret ballot on certification would allow employees to freely express their wishes .Many Canadians do not want to reveal who they voted for in a general election .I am sure that members experienced that as often as I did when they were going door to door in the last federal election .Some people are quite free in expressing how they are going to vote , but many would rather keep that to themselves .Workers should be provided that same level of comfort in expressing their views , choosing to either express them publicly or to have the privacy of a secret ballot vote in the workplace , a place where they spend by far the majority of their time .They should be made to feel welcome and comfortable , no matter what their choice , in all circumstances .The bill ensured that there was a framework in place to allow those workers to express their personal position .One other change in the previous bill was the proposal to set the threshold of employee support required to trigger certification or decertification at 40 % .It was amended to 40 % so that the trigger was the same either way , which it had not been prior to this legislation .It would be the same for certification or decertification , the same to get in and the same to get out .This number is more reflective of international conventions and the majority of provincial statutes .In fact , five provinces currently have this threshold or higher .I believe this approach is fair and creates a level playing field for both supporters and opponents in situations where the question of certification or decertification is at stake .As I said before , the creation of the new legislation was about making sure that workers are able to express themselves as they deem fit in their workplaces , allowing both those who are opponents or partisans supporting accreditation or decreditation to express their views .As I have said , it makes sense to me that we use a system for the democratic rights of workers , but it apparently also makes eminent sense to workers .Polling data on unionized and non - unionized employees across the country shows overwhelming support for a secret ballot vote on questions of certification and decertification .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"62.617928"}

{"text":"When will it take care of the economy ?We have some serious issues that have to be addressed in this country right now .Mr. Speaker , it is an honour to follow my esteemed colleague regarding the Liberals ' intent to repeal Bill C-377 and Bill C-525 .Both of these bills were about transparency .As my colleague talked about earlier , the first bills we introduced as a government were about increasing transparency , and one of the first acts of the Liberal government is to introduce bills to reduce transparency .Bill C-377 had an important purpose .The purpose was to extend the principle of public disclosure to a group of institutions that enjoy substantial public benefit : labour organizations .This is key .Public disclosure would increase the confidence of Canadians that unions spend their money wisely and effectively .Regarding Bill C-525 , which dealt with the issue of voting rights , it replaced a system called \" card check \" .The card check system allows for a workplace to be unionized without allowing all employees to express their opinions .In fact , the unionization of a workplace could occur without a significant portion of the bargaining unit having been made aware of it .Again , both of these bills dealt with improving transparency .In our strong view , Canadian union workers have the right to know how their mandatory union dues are spent .That is why our government passed Bill C-377 and Bill C-525 .Repealing these laws sends a very clear message : the Liberal government cares more about thanking union bosses , who did everything in their power to help them get elected , rather than the thousands of hard - working union members whose dues were spent without consultation .Union leaders need to be held accountable and tell their members and the public how their tax - advantaged income is spent .The Conservative Party will continue to support union transparency and stand up for union workers .As I have said in a couple of my other speeches , it is becoming quite clear that the only party that cares about Canadian workers and workers ' families is the Conservative Party of Canada .Even some labour organizations are very strongly in favour of our bill .The Christian Labour Association , Dick Heinen , the executive director , in February 2014 , said : .Now fundamentally , CLAC believes in competition in the labour relations environment in Canada .We think that workers should have the right and be free to make their own choices when it comes to which union represents them or whether they want to be represented by a union at all .As well , John Farrell , executive director of the Federally Regulated Employers , Transportation and Communications , in his testimony to the Senate committee , said : .FETCO members prefer a secret ballot vote to a card - check system for the purpose of determining if a union is to become a certified bargaining agent for employees .A secret ballot vote is the essence of a true democratic choice and is entirely consistent with Canadian democratic principles .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"66.49646"}
{"text":"This \" free association \" position focuses on the inherently coercive practice of demanding a sacrifice from all that benefit from a collective endeavor .Coercion exists when an individual objects to the purpose or activities of the collective , yet is unable to withhold their support .In the U.S. , a workplace becomes unionized when a majority of the employees in a bargaining unit petition for union representation .This \" 50 percent plus 1 \" method of determination almost guarantees the presence of a minority group that did not want a union .Further , in many instances a person gains union coverage by accepting employment at a worksite that is already unionized , without ever having the opportunity to vote for or against unionization .In a non - RTW state , a labor union and employer can agree to a union security clause that requires all covered persons to pay dues to finance collective bargaining activities .In such situations , someone seeking to avoid paying dues to the union has three options : exit their job , convince union leadership to negotiate an open shop , or persuade fellow workers to decertify the union .Given that the last two outcomes are hard to achieve , the most viable option for dissenters is to work elsewhere .Thus , the term \" right to work \" means , in its elongated form , the right to work in a unionized setting , and reap the benefits of collective representation , without having to contribute toward the cost of obtaining those benefits .And the benefits are indisputable .Depending on the occupation , unionized workers earn wages that are ten to forty percent higher than their nonunion counterparts .The positive differential for other forms of compensation , such as health care insurance and pensions , is even greater .Perhaps more important than economics , however , are matters involving justice .Nearly all union contracts feature an informal form of due process : a grievance procedure that ends in final and binding arbitration through which unions resolve disputes over the contract and employer discipline .As such , in most union settings an employer must show proof that a worker committed a wrongdoing in order to discharge them .By contrast , in a non - union setting workers are \" at will \" and can be discharged for any reason ( or none at all ) that is not proscribed by federal law .It is important to note these benefits , because while promoting free association and individual liberty sound noble , the use of such concepts to advance RTW legislation belie a less lofty motive : to undermine the economic and political power of wage - earners .As the financiers of the RTW program are well - aware , when workers act collectively they gain power at work and in society .In states that have passed RTW legislation , the wages and benefits of all workers , union and non - union , are lower than national averages .One reason is that the gains by unionized workers spill into the non - union sectors through the so - called \" threat effect \" : in the presence of a strong regional union movement , employers with a non - union workforce will raise wages and benefits to discourage employees from unionizing .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"66.54531"}

Scott Walker said 1,500 state workers could lose their jobs by July if his proposal does n't pass .Republicans in Michigan , meanwhile , are working on a bill to make the home of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. a right - to - work state .Lawmakers in those states and Ohio have sparked widespread protests with proposals to restrict longstanding collective - bargaining rights or to weaken the grip of private - sector unions that represent more than a million workers .The actions follow elections last fall that put GOP governors and Republican majorities in charge of statehouses across the region .Several of the new governors ran campaigns promising to go after public union benefits and to weaken their bargaining powers .Gov. Walker and other Republicans say they have no choice as states struggle to cover huge budget gaps .Gov. John Kasich , who is pushing a similar measure in Ohio over heated union opposition , says the moves are not an attack on unions , but an effort \" to restore some balance . \"\" We have finally elected people who are doing what they said they would do , \" said U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson , the newly elected Republican from Wisconsin , who supports efforts to trim labor 's powers .\" I certainly hope that voters will stand by Gov. Walker when he makes these tough decisions . \" Some Republicans and conservative groups also argue that pro - union laws and policies are putting states in the industrial Midwest at a disadvantage in competition for jobs with right - to - work states , where unions are weak and they can not compel workers to join or pay dues . \"Being a right to work state would bring jobs to Indiana , \" said Republican State Rep. Jerry Torr , a sponsor of the right - to - work measure in Indiana .Government figures show that inflation - adjusted per capita income in six right - to - work states increased at a 6.9 % annual rate over the past 10 years .In contrast , incomes contracted at a 0.5 % rate in six unionized upper - Midwest states over the same period , as many high - paying automotive and other manufacturing jobs disappeared and foreign auto makers concentrated nearly all of their new investment in right - to - work states .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"67.564514"}

{"text":"To give just a couple of examples , the Supreme Court of Massachusetts arguably barred peaceful picketing in one case .One New York court enjoined a strike because the union 's demands included limits on working hours designed to increase employment opportunities .In addition , the courts were prone to use the Sherman Act , which Congress passed in response to the perceived threat of industrial monopolies , against unions on the grounds that unions tended to act \" in restraint of trade .\" The early to mid-1930s saw the passage of federal legislation that swung that pendulum in the opposite direction .The keystone was the Wagner Act , now known as the National Labor Relations Act .The NLRA gave unions remarkable prerogatives .Where union recognition had been at the discretion of employers , it was now mandatory , and where union membership for workers was optional , it could be compelled .The natural sympathies for working men and women , combined with a history in which unions had been treated unfairly in the courts , tended to obscure the dramatic shift in power , but as Friedrich Hayek observed in the \" Constitution of Liberty , \" .To Hayek , control over workers was the key to control over enterprises : . \" ... the coercion which unions have been permitted to exercise contrary to all principles of freedom under the law is primarily the coercion of fellow workers .Whatever true coercive power unions may hold over employers is a consequence of this primary power of coercing other workers ... \" .And that 's where we stand today .In these negotiations the actual workers were largely bit players and the critical role was played by UAW President Ron Gettelfinger .Gettelfinger has this power because one can not legally work in most blue - collar jobs at GM , Ford or Chrysler without accepting the UAW 's representation .The companies can not go around the UAW to deal with their employees directly , and as a practical matter it has become nearly impossible for workers at these companies to remove the UAW .We in Michigan are fortunate that this time the union 's leadership has exhibited some understanding of the economy .They have not always done so .If they had acted rashly neither the workers nor management nor the residents of Michigan would have had any effective remedies .As it is , a lot of Michiganians are left wondering if the concessions might have been less sharp , and the job losses and economic distress suffered throughout Michigan less severe , if the UAW had been willing to make concessions earlier .Which leaves the people of Michigan with an important question : Was it wise to put so much economic power in the hands of one organization ?The National Labor Relations Act works in many ways to empower union officials and shield them from accountability to the workers that they are supposed to represent : .Mandatory recognition by employers is perpetual .Once a union is installed an employer must continue to treat that union as its workers ' representative unless it has remarkably strong evidence that the union has lost the support of its employees .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"67.67925"}

{"text":"RTW has nothing to do with the right of a person to seek and accept gainful employment .Rather , RTW laws prohibit a labor union and employer from negotiating union security clauses .What are union security clauses ?Union security clauses are contract provisions that regulate the collection of union dues .In non - RTW states , such as Michigan , the parties are free to negotiate a range of union security options .Unions typically prefer \" union shop \" terms that require every person benefiting from union representation to pay union dues .In RTW states , the parties are barred from negotiating union security clauses , making the default the \" open shop , \" where the payment of dues is optional for workers represented by the union .Between these two policy poles are arrangements that require represented persons to pay a proportion of full dues , and even to allow objectors to unionization to contribute dues to charity .Such arrangements are , however , also proscribed under the RTW proposal before Michigan .Labor unions are nearly universal in their opposition to RTW laws , and their argument is straightforward : each person that benefits directly from union representation should pay their fair share of the cost of that representation .In the very least , represented persons should pay a dues amount to cover the expense of negotiating and administering the labor agreement ( what are referred to as collective bargaining activities ) .For unions , this is just since , by law , they are required to represent all persons within a bargaining unit .It is critical to appreciate that although unions have some input into the composition of the bargaining unit , they can not exclude persons that simply do not want unionization .It is the National Labor Relations Board , or similar agency at the state level , that holds final judgment over bargaining unit membership .Determination is based on \" community of interest \" criteria ( e.g. similar skills , proximity , and so forth ) .Any job meeting those criteria is included , regardless of how a particular individual holding a job feels about unionization .Then , if a majority of workers in the bargaining unit elect to unionize , union leaders must represent all unit members fairly and without prejudice .Supporters of RTW laws advance two major arguments .First is that RTW laws make a state more attractive to investment , and that passage of RTW law will lead to job growth .While such statements may sound attractive to a state that is facing economic hardship , the evidence here is in dispute .Like Michigan , nearly every state in the union has lost manufacturing jobs over the last six to eight years , but it is unclear whether the rates of job loss are related to RTW laws .Our economic problems in Michigan are due primarily to the woes in the auto industry , which RTW would not fix .When making location decisions businesses rate factors such as the quality of the regional workforce , the regulatory environment , and tax incentives before ever considering RTW laws .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"68.32526"}

{"text":"Seen in this light , even the much touted right to collective bargaining is a very limited right .Like a hunting license , it does not guarantee anything but an opportunity which may or may not yield results .It should not be confused with actually conferring rights on workers , though it does help workers create a power that can win them rights .Workers who win bargaining rights through their unions have the right to collectively bargain with the employer , who has a duty to bargain in good faith ; however , the employer is under no obligation to come to a settlement .The authoritarianism of the workplace in the United States diminishes our standing as a democracy .Indeed , in the latter part of this century , instead of the democratization of the American workplace , the hierarchical corporate workplace model is coming to dominate the rest of society .Beyond \" Bread and Butter \" Unionism .Yet the two are linked .Democracy and workers ' rights in the workplace are crucial issues for organizing .And without greater levels of organization , inequality will continue to rise .Yet unions can not meet these admirable goals if they are simply a type of business - \" Contracts ' R Us \" - or if they operate merely as a non - profit insurance company seeking to protect its client / members from unexpected trouble .This is not a new tension .Servicing the membership has often been held as incompatible with fulfilling the wider social mission of labor to serve the needs of all working people , whether they are organized or not .But it is now becoming increasingly clear that unions need to do both .Unions , like any organization , will not survive if they do not serve the needs of their members .Nor will unions survive if they only serve the needs of their members .The experience of organized labor in the US demonstrates that simply delivering for their own members is not sufficient for success in the long run .Measured in this narrowest sense of \" delivering \" for members , US trade unions have been the most \" successful \" labor movement in the world .Unions won for their members a social wage ( benefits such as pensions , health care , paid vacations ) that working people in other advanced industrial countries were able to win only through political as well as industrial action .In addition , US trade unionists enjoy the highest wage premium of unionists in any country - that is , the difference in pay and benefits between organized workers and the unorganized workers in the same sector .Thus , if serving the membership was the key to building unions , then the US should have the highest rate of unionization in the world , not one of the lowest .The low levels of unionization underline the fact that there is a downside to labor 's achievement for its members : The higher the wage premium , the greater the employer resistance to unionization .The sad lesson for labor is that by failing to extend the gains made by unions to the rest of working people , these gains have come to be threatened .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"69.964294"}

{"text":"The 1994 debate over health care reform -- already a fading memory -- exemplified this process in politics .The question was whether we should leave this critical service to individuals seeking private solutions through a maze of various insurance plans or whether society as a whole should organize a system of insurance to assure universal , comprehensive , affordable , quality coverage for all .The Canadian single - payer system was held up as an example of how the provision of insurance could be socialized , while leaving the practice of medicine private and assuring freedom of choice of doctors .Although we have already socialized health insurance for the elderly through Medicare , many Americans seemed to balk at the prospect of socialized medicine for all .Yet in US history we have often done precisely this - socialized a service - transforming it from an individual responsibility to a community - provided right of all .The fire department and fire service throughout this country at the turn of the century were private ; fire service was an individual responsibility .Those who could afford it , and those who had the most to lose in case of fire , financed private fire companies .The companies gave their patrons iron plaques which they could post on the outside of their buildings to assure that in case of fire the local fire service would know they were insured and act promptly .Of course fire does not confine itself to purchasers of fire service .So , the insured sought to socialize the service , that is , extend fire service to everyone - through a universal , single payer , high quality , public system .Taxes , rather than private insurance fees , financed the universal system .And the universal system was cheaper , and more efficient .The quality was assured because rich and poor alike were covered by the system .Everyone could access the system as needed and everyone paid into the system through their taxes to the community .No doubt , the cynics of the day argued that the poor would take advantage of this social service , or that people would simply not be able to appreciate what they had unless they paid for it .Through the political process , the problem of fires was moved from the realm of individual concern to collective responsibility .Today , the need for universal fire service seems obvious .Interestingly , the need for health care is still not regarded as a societal right .But that is the essence of the political challenge - to construct what is possible .Who Decides : Market Values or Social Values ?Clearly understanding this point , the New Right has a program to construct a new political consensus .In the US and elsewhere , this program designates virtually all problems as the responsibility of the individual , whose fate is left to the mercy of the market .Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher summarized this approach succinctly : \" there is no such thing as society , only individuals and their families .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.19701"}

{"text":"This culture of safety derives from a commitment to an effective , comprehensive safety and health management program .Since compliance with safety and health standards is the responsibility of mine operators , MSHA plans to publish a proposed rule to require mine operators to develop comprehensive Safety and Health Management Programs for Mines .MSHA believes that operators with effective safety and health management programs would identify and correct hazards in a more timely manner , resulting in fewer accidents , injuries and illnesses .To help develop the proposal , MSHA held public meetings and gathered information from worker organizations , industry , academia , government , and safety and health professionals about model safety and health programs .Examinations of Work Areas in Underground Coal Mines for Violations of Mandatory Health or Safety Standards .The proposal would assure that underground coal mine operators find and fix violations of mandatory health or safety standards , thereby improving health and safety for miners .Pattern of Violations .MSHA has determined that the existing pattern criteria and procedures contained in 30 CFR part 104 do not reflect the statutory intent for section 104(e ) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 ( Mine Act ) .The legislative history of the Mine Act explains that Congress intended the pattern of violations to be an enforcement tool for operators who have demonstrated a disregard for the health and safety of miners .These mine operators , who have a chronic history of persistent significant and substantial ( S&S ) violations , needlessly expose miners to the same hazards again and again .This indicates a serious safety and health management problem at a mine .The goal of the pattern of violations proposed rule is to compel operators to manage health and safety conditions so that the root causes of S&S violations are found and fixed before they become a hazard to miners .The proposal would reflect statutory intent , simplify the pattern of violations criteria , and improve consistency in applying the pattern of violations criteria .Addressing Targeted Hazards .Maintenance of Incombustible Content of Rock Dust in Underground Coal Mines .To help prevent explosion hazards , MSHA issued an emergency temporary standard ( ETS ) in response to the grave danger that miners in underground bituminous coal mines face when accumulations of coal dust are not made inert .MSHA concluded from investigations of mine explosions and other reports that immediate action was necessary to protect miners .Accumulations of coal dust can ignite , resulting in an explosion , or after an explosion , accumulations can propagate , increasing the severity of explosions .The ETS requires mine operators to increase the incombustible content of combined coal dust , rock dust , and other dust to at least 80 percent in underground bituminous coal mines .The ETS strengthens the protections for miners by reducing both the potential for and the severity of coal mine explosions .Regulating Crystalline Silica Exposure .The Agency 's regulatory actions also exemplify a commitment to protecting the most vulnerable populations while assuring broad - based compliance .Health hazards are pervasive in both coal and metal / nonmetal mines ( including surface and underground mines ) and large and small mines .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"70.59056"}

{"text":"posted at 10:01 am on June 7 , 2012 by Ed Morrissey .Actually , I do n't disagree with MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow on this point , but I do disagree with her on what it means .Maddow argues that efforts to roll back collective bargaining privileges for unions - which she defines too broadly - means that unions will have less cash to spend on political activism , and that without the influx of that cash , Democrats simply ca n't compete .But Maddow blames that on the reforms when she should be blaming it on the Democrats themselves : . \"The Wisconsin Republicans , under Scott Walker , were using public policy to essentially dismantle public sector unions in Wisconsin .And that - however you feel about union rights in the country - it had one very practical , partisan effect , which is that the unions had been big supporters of Democratic candidates and Democratic causes and had had a lot to do with the Democratic ground game .And that is the reality now in Wisconsin .It is the reality in states where they have essentially eliminated unions rights . \"\" I think , \" Maddow added , \" structurally , that 's a pretty dire electoral situation for Democrats . \"Democrats have every opportunity to raise the same kind of cash that Republicans do .There are no industry assignments for donors to parties .Barack Obama is in the middle of a two - day trip to raise $ 15 million in California , mainly from the entertainment industry , for instance .Democrats have launched super - PACs and have their own sugar daddies like George Soros and Warren Buffett to match the Koch Brothers .The problem for Democrats is that they have become the party of the public - employee unions , and therefore the party of institutionalized and unaccountable bureaucracies .Maddow defines union reform too broadly ; the reform in Wisconsin , for instance , dealt entirely with public - employee unions , not private - sector unions , and did n't even include all PEUs .Furthermore , the money raised by Republicans ( and Democrats in other contexts ) are entirely voluntary .Until Act 10 took effect in Wisconsin , the state seized dues on behalf of the unions whether employees wanted to fund the political efforts of the unions or not , which the unions then used to elect politicians that would keep enforcing those seizures .Does n't Maddow have even a twinge of shame to see the vast exodus from the union membership after Act 10 , which demonstrates that the only reason the \" donations \" for their political efforts was by force ?Democrats made the choice to become the party of institutionalized and unaccountable bureaucracy ; in Wisconsin , they practically adopted that as a motto in the recall election .They are now only beginning to realize that the public is fed up with the costs and gross inefficiencies of government at all levels , and especially of the sick relationship between PEUs and the politicians they help election .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"73.20775"}

{"text":"It is the reality in states where they have essentially eliminated unions rights . \"\" I think , \" Maddow added , \" structurally , that 's a pretty dire electoral situation for Democrats . \"Democrats have every opportunity to raise the same kind of cash that Republicans do .There are no industry assignments for donors to parties .Barack Obama is in the middle of a two - day trip to raise $ 15 million in California , mainly from the entertainment industry , for instance .Democrats have launched super - PACs and have their own sugar daddies like George Soros and Warren Buffett to match the Koch Brothers .The problem for Democrats is that they have become the party of the public - employee unions , and therefore the party of institutionalized and unaccountable bureaucracies .Maddow defines union reform too broadly ; the reform in Wisconsin , for instance , dealt entirely with public - employee unions , not private - sector unions , and did n't even include all PEUs .Furthermore , the money raised by Republicans ( and Democrats in other contexts ) are entirely voluntary .Until Act 10 took effect in Wisconsin , the state seized dues on behalf of the unions whether employees wanted to fund the political efforts of the unions or not , which the unions then used to elect politicians that would keep enforcing those seizures .Does n't Maddow have even a twinge of shame to see the vast exodus from the union membership after Act 10 , which demonstrates that the only reason the \" donations \" for their political efforts was by force ?Democrats made the choice to become the party of institutionalized and unaccountable bureaucracy ; in Wisconsin , they practically adopted that as a motto in the recall election .They are now only beginning to realize that the public is fed up with the costs and gross inefficiencies of government at all levels , and especially of the sick relationship between PEUs and the politicians they help election .In my column for The Fiscal Times today , I call this a watershed moment for the public - sector union movement : .Immediately , complaints arose over a disparity in financing between the two candidates in the recall election as an excuse for the unions ' failure .Scott Walker raised a huge amount of money , a good portion from outside of Wisconsin , while Democrats and the unions circulated recall petitions .However , the unions spent millions of dollars to get the recall election in the first place , and then provided a large boost to Barrett in organizing and GOTV efforts .Those actually succeeded - turnout was high in Democratic areas - but Walker 's GOTV outpaced the union efforts as voters thundered to the polls to support the governor and his PEU reforms .That is a bad sign for labor , with its modern reliance on organizing in the public sector .Walker pulled back the green curtain on the unhealthy relationship between PEUs and politicians , which creates an accountability gap on spending and an obstacle to efficiency in government .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.4064"}
{"text":"The normal response is that such an act is a personal rebuke , a signal of failure and a rejection of their management .Why is such a paternalistic attitude , which would be quickly recognized as such in politics , so widely accepted in employment relations ?But is the workplace really so autocratic ?Why such an extreme characterization ?Some illustrations of the uniqueness of the work environment , in which the normal rules of our legal system simply do not apply , are worth noting .For it is in the workplace that citizens are transformed into employees who learn to leave their rights at the door .Take , for example , a fundamental assumption in our legal system - the presumption of innocence .In the workplace , this presumption is turned on its head .The rule of the workplace is that management dictates and workers obey .If a worker is accused of a transgression by management , there is no presumption of innocence .Even in organized workplaces the rule remains : work first , grieve later .Organized workers protected by a collective agreement with a contractual grievance procedure can at least grieve an unjust practice ( or more specifically , one that violates the rights won through collective bargaining ) .Unorganized workers , on the other hand , have the option of appealing to their superiors ' benevolence or joining the unemployment line .The implied voluntary labor contract - undertaken by workers when they agree to employment - gives management almost total control of the work relationship .\" Free labor \" entails no rights other than the freedom to quit without penalty .That 's one step up from indentured servitude , but still a long distance from democracy .There is not even protection in our system against arbitrary and capricious actions by management .There is no general right to employment security and no prohibition against unjust dismissal in the private sector such as exists in most other advanced industrial countries .The law of the US workplace is governed by the doctrine of \" employment at will .\" There is some protection to ensure that an employee may not be dismissed for clearly discriminatory reasons of race , gender , disability or age .But that same employee can be Black , female , older , white , male or whatever , and as long as the dismissal is for \" no reason , \" it 's legal .Most Americans believe that there is a law that protects them from being fired for \" no cause .\" But they 're wrong .Free Speech for Whom ?A most glaring example of the power imbalance on the job concerns the freedom of speech .Often celebrated as the most cherished right of a free citizen , most Americans are astonished to learn that freedom of speech does not extend to the workplace , or at least not to workers .It is literally true that free speech exists for bosses , but not workers .The First Amendment of the Bill of Rights applies only to the encroachment by government on citizens ' speech .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.54328"}

Meyer , \" Policy Lessons from the U.S.Unemployment Insurance Experiments , \" National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No .4197 , October 1992 .The willingness and ability of states to explore innovative ways to reduce UI duration is evident from the number of state UI experiments that have been wholly state funded .The actual gross FUTA tax rate is 6.2 percent .However , employers in states with federally approved UI programs ( all 50 states ) may credit 5.4 percent ( 90 percent FUTA offset ) against the 6.2 percent tax rate , making the net FUTA tax rate 0.8 percent .The 1992 amendment allowed states to trigger EB based on a certain percentage of total unemployment rate ( TUR ) instead of an adjusted insured unemployment rate ( IUR ) .The IUR is computed by dividing the number of people claiming UI benefits by the number in jobs covered by UI .The TUR is the ratio of all unemployed workers to all workers in the labor force in that state .Eight states ( Alaska , Connecticut , Kansas , Maine , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington ) have approved the use of TUR triggers .Some of the difference between the insured unemployment rate and the total employment rate is due also to the exclusion of self - employed , certain agricultural labor and domestic service workers , railroad workers , and certain seasonal camp workers from collecting UI benefits .FUTA funds are deposited indirectly in the FUA when the EUCA and Employment Security Administration Account ( ESAA ) have reached their statutory limits .The ESAA is used to finance the administrative costs of the employment security program and should be phased out .Funds in the ESAA should be allocated to state UI accounts for the administration of state UI programs .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"77.46439"}

{"text":"In mid - February , 7,600 baggage handlers and ramp workers for Continental Airlines -- painfully aware that they were the lowest - paid handlers in the industry and that their four previous attempts to unionize had all fallen short -- finally voted to join a union .This was a more arduous achievement than it may sound .Under the byzantine provisions of the Railway Labor Act , which governs labor relations in the airline industry as well , workers seeking a union need to win a majority not just of those employees who vote but of all the employees in their unit .Worse yet , their unit is defined as everyone in their job category within the United States : The more than 2,000 Continental ramp workers employed at the airline 's Houston hub , for instance , could not vote to join the union on their own .In fact , says Jeff Farmer , the organizing director of the Teamsters , the union that the ramp workers voted to join , \" Continental has 47 stations across the country -- and we were able to reach out to all of them .\" That required a campaign on a scale that only half a dozen of America 's unions would be able to mount , and even by those standards , the Teamsters ' effort was extraordinary . \"A number of other unions congratulated us , \" Farmer adds .But the reason for the congratulations was sobering : The Teamsters ' victory was just about the only good news that American unions had experienced in the first year of Barack Obama 's presidency .In 2008 , unions had worked tirelessly for Obama 's election in the hope that a Democratic president backed up by a heavily Democratic Congress could change the law that made organizing American workers so difficult .With the upset victory of Republican Scott Brown in the race for the vacant Senate seat from Massachusetts , however , those hopes were definitively dispelled .The failure to reform labor law almost certainly means that that the half - century decline of unions in America -- from representing nearly 40 percent of private - sector workers at the midpoint of the 20th century to representing just 7 percent today -- will continue apace .It means that the corresponding stagnation -- and periodic decline -- in the incomes of working- and middle - class Americans will likely continue as well .But the failure of labor - law reform was hardly the only disaster that befell unions in 2009 .Amid the greatest economic downturn since the 1930s , many thousands of unionized manufacturing , construction , and public employees lost their jobs , sending the percentage of unionized workers to record lows .Public support for unions also plunged , with both the Gallup and Pew polls showing a decline in public support of between 15 percent and 20 percent over the past several years .( In the Pew poll , those who had a favorable view of unions declined from 58 percent in 2007 to 41 percent in 2010 . )Even the most basic expectations that unions had of the newly elected Democratic president and Congress were initially dashed .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"78.07059"}

Co. 1991 ) , dealt with communications between members .The courts logic is difficult to comprehend .A labor relations privilege is designed to protect confidential labor relations information and it should make no difference whether the discussion with the union is being held with other union members or union employees .The policy reasons behind this privilege ( to encourage open and frank debate and to not chill union activity ) remain the same .Today , I rise in advance of leading a special order this evening , to offer a resolution supporting the rights of all workers , including federal employees and other public employees , and calling for an end to attacks on their ability to organize and to collectively bargain .There are only a few salient rights recognized by every democracy , such as freedom of religion and freedom of speech , and on that list always appears the right for workers to organize in order to bargain collectively with an employer .It has long been recognized that individual workers have little , if any , bargaining power sitting alone with an employer who has hired or could hire her .When unions organize workers , the ground becomes more level and economic conditions decide the outcome .Mr. Speaker , the American labor movement has been a major catalyst for the formation of a majority middle class in the United States by leading the way for improvements for all workers , which unions gain through collective bargaining .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.53613"}
