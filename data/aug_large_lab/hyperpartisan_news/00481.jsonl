{"text":"As the global economy faces greater uncertainty , it is more important than ever that we send a clear message to the world that Britain is not going to waver on dealing with its debts .This stability is vital in attracting the business and international investment that delivers growth and jobs , and which keeps long - term interest rates low .So we will stick to our plan on the deficit and continue to use monetary policy to support growth without adding to borrowing or debt .This sounds like a generic political statement , formulated to put out specific words in a specific order to appeal to the subconscious mind of the voter .But it is more than that : this is a poke in the side of Germany and other euro - zone countries who can not get their economies going .Cameron 's point is , plainly , that Britain has been successful in separating its fiscal and monetary policies from the European mainstream - and that Britain will continue to pursue its own , independent economic policies .In fact , as Cameron continues , he carves out an even sharper independent profile for himself and his country : .Our long - term plan is backing business by scrapping red tape , cutting taxes , building world - class skills and supporting exports to emerging markets .Underpinning all of this is our radical programme of investment in infrastructure .We 'll see how that energy policy works in the end .American energy prices are falling , thanks in part to an expansion of oil and natural gas production on private land .But again - Cameron 's point is that Britain stands out among European countries , that the leading euro - zone economies are in permanent stagnation and that Britain is not going to fold into the ranks of European mediocrity .David Cameron is not the best option for Britain .He is , fundamentally , a traditional British Europhile .But the fact that he talks so forcefully about the uniqueness of British economic policies and economic performance is a clear indication of which way Britain is heading , and why .His article simply confirms how strong the euroskeptics are in Britain and thereby the high probability that Nigel Farage of the UKIP will be their next Prime Minister .Let us hope that Cameron continues with his moderately successful fiscal policies .If he can make an example out of Britain to the rest of Europe , he can embolden Euroskeptics elsewhere in the EU .Eventually , their strength - given that they are of the UKIP kind and not aggressive nationalists - will bring an end to the stifling statism that has become endemic in austerity - ridden eurozone welfare states .Like this : .As the dust settles on the elections to the European Parliament , a somewhat schizophrenic conclusion is emerging : . on the one hand voters expressed their skepticism toward the EU project and rejected , overall , the notion of a continuous , business - as - usual expansion of the EU into a new , gigantic government bureaucracy ; . on the other hand the rejection of even bigger government was partly expressed in a form that , absurdly enough , may very well pave the way for another , even uglier form of government expansion .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"61.753456"}

{"text":"For years it struggled to gain attention .Mr Farage 's tactical genius was to turn it into a populist anti - Establishment party , articulating deep - seated public anxieties about the two great taboos of modern political debate : Europe and immigration .In many corners of the media , as well as in Westminster itself , both of these issues are regarded as toxic .Yet by ignoring them , the politicians have simply handed them to Mr Farage .In the few days before Thursday 's elections , most of the coverage hinged on immigration .When an exhausted Mr Farage said he would not want Romanians to move in next door to him , many commentators declared that he had committed an unforgivable gaffe which would poison his national reputation and destroy his support overnight .I was reminded , however , of an interview Margaret Thatcher gave during a by - election campaign in Ilford in 1978 , when she remarked that people were frightened of being ' swamped ' by immigrants .Like Mr Farage , she was seen as having committed a dreadful error .However , the supposed gaffe struck a chord , and the Tories promptly romped to victory .The truth is that the immigration issue has been simmering unhealthily away for at least 40 years .As early as the late-1960s , polls showed that among young and old alike , mass immigration was by far the most unpopular development of the decade .Among Britain 's politicians , however , immigration has always been the ultimate taboo .When Enoch Powell spoke out in 1968 , he was roundly condemned and thrown off the Tory front bench .Then as now , in other words , there was a wide gulf between what people thought at Westminster and what people thought in the rest of the country .Writing a few days after the speech , the Guardian 's star columnist Peter Jenkins dismissed arguments that Powell and his admirers were merely racist .What motivated them , Jenkins wrote , was the feeling that ' the politicians are conspiring against the people , that the country is led by men who have no idea about what interests or frightens the ordinary people in the back streets of Wolverhampton ' .That sounds pretty familiar to me .Some of Mr Farage 's supporters may , indeed , be racially prejudiced , and certainly one or two of his councillors have some jaw - dropping medieval opinions .But I think there is much more to it than the prejudices of a minority .For decades , surveys have shown that millions of ordinary people dislike the European Union and are alarmed by the influx of so many newcomers , especially in working - class towns struggling to cope with the decline of industry and the rise of unemployment .Contrary to what the sneering metropolitan commentators like to think , the vast majority of these people are not racists .What worries them is the evaporation of jobs which are going overseas , the stagnation of real wages , the shortage of decent housing , the overcrowding of primary schools and the rising pressure on hospital wards and A&E departments .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"73.45123"}

'When he walked on to the stage in Portsmouth , ' wrote one reporter in last week 's Spectator magazine , ' the crowd rose for him with a fervour I 've never witnessed at a mainstream party conference . 'There is , of course , an obvious explanation .What Mr Farage has tapped into is a widespread national discontent that can not merely be dismissed - as some metropolitan commentators have tried to do - as racism or xenophobia .Ukip was founded in 1993 as an obscure anti - federalist pressure group .For years it struggled to gain attention .Mr Farage 's tactical genius was to turn it into a populist anti - Establishment party , articulating deep - seated public anxieties about the two great taboos of modern political debate : Europe and immigration .In many corners of the media , as well as in Westminster itself , both of these issues are regarded as toxic .Yet by ignoring them , the politicians have simply handed them to Mr Farage .In the few days before Thursday 's elections , most of the coverage hinged on immigration .When an exhausted Mr Farage said he would not want Romanians to move in next door to him , many commentators declared that he had committed an unforgivable gaffe which would poison his national reputation and destroy his support overnight .I was reminded , however , of an interview Margaret Thatcher gave during a by - election campaign in Ilford in 1978 , when she remarked that people were frightened of being ' swamped ' by immigrants .Like Mr Farage , she was seen as having committed a dreadful error .However , the supposed gaffe struck a chord , and the Tories promptly romped to victory .The truth is that the immigration issue has been simmering unhealthily away for at least 40 years .As early as the late-1960s , polls showed that among young and old alike , mass immigration was by far the most unpopular development of the decade .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.27378"}

'The Ukip fox , ' Mr Farage said delightedly yesterday , ' is in the Westminster hen house . 'That is putting it mildly - not least since the results in the European elections , which will not be counted until tomorrow , are expected to be even better for Ukip .To get a sense of how far Mr Farage 's party has come , consider this .In the 2010 General Election , Ukip won just 3 per cent of the vote .It does not have a single MP , its last election manifesto was wildly incoherent and , with the exception of the ebullient Mr Farage , its representatives are utterly obscure .Yet for the second consecutive year , Ukip has won around a fifth of the national vote .Defying all the predictions , it has gained more than 100 council seats .In Essex , it denied the Tories victory in Basildon , Castle Point and Southend .And in Rotherham , supposedly a working - class Labour bastion , its candidates averaged a whopping 47 per cent of the vote .By any standards this represents a political earthquake .Since the 1930s , British politics has essentially been a two - and - a - half - party system , with the Tories and Labour monopolising the dance floor and the Lib Dems , in their various forms , lurking half - heartedly on the fringes .What is now clear is that those days are finished .Neither David Cameron nor Ed Miliband has the slightest hope of winning as much as 40 per cent of the vote at the next General Election .And given Ukip 's performance over the past few years , it would be a brave man who would bet against them picking up at least 10 per cent of the vote - and maybe more - in May 2015 .The really extraordinary thing is that this has been the achievement of one man .Who would have believed that the outspoken Nigel Farage , a privately - educated former City trader who has never won a Westminster seat , would inspire such enthusiasm among ordinary voters from the housing estates of Essex to the post - industrial towns of South Yorkshire ?

{"text":"Ask any governor of any U.S. state if he has just a \" consultative \" function vs. the federal government , and you will get a long , passionate lecture about how he is elected by the people of his state and how he is accountable to them alone .And again - the lawmakers in Congress make federal laws , but state legislators make state laws , and the distinction is vigorously maintained .And fought over , which keeps the constitution of this great country alive and well .While Commissioner Reding 's vision comes nowhere close to resembling a United States of Europe , it does serve another , for Europe more healthy purpose : .Nigel Farage , the leader of Ukip , said that Mrs Reding had revealed the true choice for British voters to make at polling stations .\" For people in power in Brussels that is the only choice on offer , no reform just a United States of Europe .On 22 May the British people must ask themselves if they want this and vote accordingly , \" he said .\" I am sure people will say no to this centralist fanaticism .\" The only point of disagreement between me and Mr. Farage - whose political mission I respect and strongly support - would be , again , that whe Commissioner Reding is creating is something far more centralized than it is presented as .By letting the Commission supersede national governments and the MEPs supersede national legislators , Commissioner Reding is de facto envisioning a traditional European nation state , elevated to govern half - a - billion people .It was the traditional nation state that American pilgrims left behind , and European emigrants to America sought to get away from .Even as Europe 's nation states created national parliaments , they never got very far with democratizing their governments .Legislative and fiscal powers have remained heavily centralized , and with very few exceptions - Britain being one - the European standard is the unhealthy proportionate , entirely party - ruled election system .What is truly frightening about Commissioner Reding 's vision is that actually would create an even more un - democratic Europe : more laws would be made , and more executive power would be concentrated , to fewer hands , farther away from voters .Especially frightening is the vision of a Commission that would supersede national governments - without even being elected !To make this vision even more nightmarish , consider the fact that there are no rigorous boundaries between legislative and executive powers in the EU .During the current economic crisis the Commission has effectively served as a legislative body for the national budgets in austerity - hit member states such as Greece , Italy and Spain .With more powers , and an even stronger formalized role as the supreme institution of the EU , the Commission would effectively be the unelected dictatorial power over 500 million people .Luckily , there are brave freedom fighters like Nigel Farage out there trying to stop the Monster State of Europe from happening .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"81.65887"}

{"text":"However , the supposed gaffe struck a chord , and the Tories promptly romped to victory .The truth is that the immigration issue has been simmering unhealthily away for at least 40 years .As early as the late-1960s , polls showed that among young and old alike , mass immigration was by far the most unpopular development of the decade .Among Britain 's politicians , however , immigration has always been the ultimate taboo .When Enoch Powell spoke out in 1968 , he was roundly condemned and thrown off the Tory front bench .Then as now , in other words , there was a wide gulf between what people thought at Westminster and what people thought in the rest of the country .Writing a few days after the speech , the Guardian 's star columnist Peter Jenkins dismissed arguments that Powell and his admirers were merely racist .What motivated them , Jenkins wrote , was the feeling that ' the politicians are conspiring against the people , that the country is led by men who have no idea about what interests or frightens the ordinary people in the back streets of Wolverhampton ' .That sounds pretty familiar to me .Some of Mr Farage 's supporters may , indeed , be racially prejudiced , and certainly one or two of his councillors have some jaw - dropping medieval opinions .But I think there is much more to it than the prejudices of a minority .For decades , surveys have shown that millions of ordinary people dislike the European Union and are alarmed by the influx of so many newcomers , especially in working - class towns struggling to cope with the decline of industry and the rise of unemployment .Contrary to what the sneering metropolitan commentators like to think , the vast majority of these people are not racists .What worries them is the evaporation of jobs which are going overseas , the stagnation of real wages , the shortage of decent housing , the overcrowding of primary schools and the rising pressure on hospital wards and A&E departments .Britain 's political and media classes , however , have shown themselves almost entirely uninterested - and for depressingly obvious reasons .Most British politicians inhabit a gilded bubble .They are often born into comfortable households , go to private schools ( or elite comprehensives ) and then spend three years at Oxford or Cambridge before becoming political researchers , special advisers and MPs .Well - heeled politicians such as David Cameron , Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg , like their friends and allies in the liberal media , see only the benefits of European membership and the unfettered movement of labour .To them , immigration means cheaper au pairs , cleaners and builders .Because they rarely see the world outside Westminster , except on flying visits to their constituencies , they have no sense of the anxiety in working - class communities and are quick to condemn anybody who violates their shared taboo .One example tells a wider story .Last year , the former editor of Prospect magazine , David Goodhart , published a book ( serialised in the Mail ) , arguing that immigration was undermining national solidarity and the welfare state , and should , therefore , be curtailed .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"83.856285"}

{"text":"When Enoch Powell spoke out in 1968 , he was roundly condemned and thrown off the Tory front bench .Then as now , in other words , there was a wide gulf between what people thought at Westminster and what people thought in the rest of the country .Writing a few days after the speech , the Guardian 's star columnist Peter Jenkins dismissed arguments that Powell and his admirers were merely racist .What motivated them , Jenkins wrote , was the feeling that ' the politicians are conspiring against the people , that the country is led by men who have no idea about what interests or frightens the ordinary people in the back streets of Wolverhampton ' .That sounds pretty familiar to me .Some of Mr Farage 's supporters may , indeed , be racially prejudiced , and certainly one or two of his councillors have some jaw - dropping medieval opinions .But I think there is much more to it than the prejudices of a minority .For decades , surveys have shown that millions of ordinary people dislike the European Union and are alarmed by the influx of so many newcomers , especially in working - class towns struggling to cope with the decline of industry and the rise of unemployment .Contrary to what the sneering metropolitan commentators like to think , the vast majority of these people are not racists .What worries them is the evaporation of jobs which are going overseas , the stagnation of real wages , the shortage of decent housing , the overcrowding of primary schools and the rising pressure on hospital wards and A&E departments .Britain 's political and media classes , however , have shown themselves almost entirely uninterested - and for depressingly obvious reasons .Most British politicians inhabit a gilded bubble .They are often born into comfortable households , go to private schools ( or elite comprehensives ) and then spend three years at Oxford or Cambridge before becoming political researchers , special advisers and MPs .Well - heeled politicians such as David Cameron , Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg , like their friends and allies in the liberal media , see only the benefits of European membership and the unfettered movement of labour .To them , immigration means cheaper au pairs , cleaners and builders .Because they rarely see the world outside Westminster , except on flying visits to their constituencies , they have no sense of the anxiety in working - class communities and are quick to condemn anybody who violates their shared taboo .One example tells a wider story .Last year , the former editor of Prospect magazine , David Goodhart , published a book ( serialised in the Mail ) , arguing that immigration was undermining national solidarity and the welfare state , and should , therefore , be curtailed .As the incarnation of liberal - minded intellectualism , Mr Goodhart was very obviously not a racist .Yet to many people in London 's political and literary elites , he had put himself beyond the pale .Not only did his expected invitation to the Hay Literary Festival not materialise , but there were howls of protest when his book was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize for political writing .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"86.568695"}

{"text":"To get a sense of how far Mr Farage 's party has come , consider this .In the 2010 General Election , Ukip won just 3 per cent of the vote .It does not have a single MP , its last election manifesto was wildly incoherent and , with the exception of the ebullient Mr Farage , its representatives are utterly obscure .Yet for the second consecutive year , Ukip has won around a fifth of the national vote .Defying all the predictions , it has gained more than 100 council seats .In Essex , it denied the Tories victory in Basildon , Castle Point and Southend .And in Rotherham , supposedly a working - class Labour bastion , its candidates averaged a whopping 47 per cent of the vote .By any standards this represents a political earthquake .Since the 1930s , British politics has essentially been a two - and - a - half - party system , with the Tories and Labour monopolising the dance floor and the Lib Dems , in their various forms , lurking half - heartedly on the fringes .What is now clear is that those days are finished .Neither David Cameron nor Ed Miliband has the slightest hope of winning as much as 40 per cent of the vote at the next General Election .And given Ukip 's performance over the past few years , it would be a brave man who would bet against them picking up at least 10 per cent of the vote - and maybe more - in May 2015 .The really extraordinary thing is that this has been the achievement of one man .Who would have believed that the outspoken Nigel Farage , a privately - educated former City trader who has never won a Westminster seat , would inspire such enthusiasm among ordinary voters from the housing estates of Essex to the post - industrial towns of South Yorkshire ? 'When he walked on to the stage in Portsmouth , ' wrote one reporter in last week 's Spectator magazine , ' the crowd rose for him with a fervour I 've never witnessed at a mainstream party conference . 'There is , of course , an obvious explanation .What Mr Farage has tapped into is a widespread national discontent that can not merely be dismissed - as some metropolitan commentators have tried to do - as racism or xenophobia .Ukip was founded in 1993 as an obscure anti - federalist pressure group .For years it struggled to gain attention .Mr Farage 's tactical genius was to turn it into a populist anti - Establishment party , articulating deep - seated public anxieties about the two great taboos of modern political debate : Europe and immigration .In many corners of the media , as well as in Westminster itself , both of these issues are regarded as toxic .Yet by ignoring them , the politicians have simply handed them to Mr Farage .In the few days before Thursday 's elections , most of the coverage hinged on immigration .When an exhausted Mr Farage said he would not want Romanians to move in next door to him , many commentators declared that he had committed an unforgivable gaffe which would poison his national reputation and destroy his support overnight .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"88.64743"}

{"text":"That translated into the continued electoral dominance of Chávez 's political heirs , who are still unbeatable today at the ballot box in the parts of Venezuelan society he organized .Not only that , but it 's also the reason why these same people proved to be so loyal to Chávez , and willing to work and fight for the movement he led whenever their support was needed .So for example in 2002 , when Venezuela 's elite ousted Chávez in a coup , his massive base took to the streets and made it impossible for the ruling junta to govern .Most importantly , the military rank and file could not be counted on to follow junta orders to suppress those massive street demonstrations .That meant checkmate for the coup leaders : In just 48 hours , Chávez was back in the presidential palace and the coup leaders were under arrest or in hiding .That 's what real organized power looks like .Paraguay 's would - be equivalent to Chavez , Fernando Lugo , was also an outsider .Lugo broke the Colorado Party 's 60-year one - party reign in Paraguay after winning the presidency in 2008 .That alone is a very weak foundation for political power , especially if you are running on a platform that plans to challenge entrenched elites .Lugo offered the Liberal Party the vice presidency plus several cabinet seats .In exchange , the Liberals lent Lugo their party structure .Until they decided to take it back , that is .The Liberal Party quickly grew tired of Lugo 's populist politics and started negotiating with their supposed enemies , the Colorados , to oust him .Which they finally did last year , orchestrating a sham , record - speed impeachment ( it took all of one day to oust Lugo ) based on very dubious charges .A lot of Paraguayans denounced the impeachment of Fernando Lugo as a coup , but almost no one was ready to take the streets or go on strike to defend the ousted president .Unlike Chávez , Lugo had no real power base to counter the old Paraguayan elite .So he took it , went home with his head down , leaving office with what at the time sounded like an oddly acquiescent and not at all combative farewell speech .In hindsight , it 's clear now that Lugo knew his situation better than those of us watching that speech on TV - that he had no one to fight for him , and that he 'd have to start from scratch .Responding to coups is just one of the most obvious , visible examples of what I 'm talking about , but there 's much more to territorial politics than this .Having an organized network of people that the leadership trusts enables them to understand what 's going on at the grassroots level , like political intelligence that 's reliable .What are ordinary people unhappy about ?Is the government ( whether you 're part of it or not ) doing things that have unexpected negative consequences in their everyday lives ?","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"91.77841"}
{"text":"That is putting it mildly - not least since the results in the European elections , which will not be counted until tomorrow , are expected to be even better for Ukip .To get a sense of how far Mr Farage 's party has come , consider this .In the 2010 General Election , Ukip won just 3 per cent of the vote .It does not have a single MP , its last election manifesto was wildly incoherent and , with the exception of the ebullient Mr Farage , its representatives are utterly obscure .Yet for the second consecutive year , Ukip has won around a fifth of the national vote .Defying all the predictions , it has gained more than 100 council seats .In Essex , it denied the Tories victory in Basildon , Castle Point and Southend .And in Rotherham , supposedly a working - class Labour bastion , its candidates averaged a whopping 47 per cent of the vote .By any standards this represents a political earthquake .Since the 1930s , British politics has essentially been a two - and - a - half - party system , with the Tories and Labour monopolising the dance floor and the Lib Dems , in their various forms , lurking half - heartedly on the fringes .What is now clear is that those days are finished .Neither David Cameron nor Ed Miliband has the slightest hope of winning as much as 40 per cent of the vote at the next General Election .And given Ukip 's performance over the past few years , it would be a brave man who would bet against them picking up at least 10 per cent of the vote - and maybe more - in May 2015 .The really extraordinary thing is that this has been the achievement of one man .Who would have believed that the outspoken Nigel Farage , a privately - educated former City trader who has never won a Westminster seat , would inspire such enthusiasm among ordinary voters from the housing estates of Essex to the post - industrial towns of South Yorkshire ? 'When he walked on to the stage in Portsmouth , ' wrote one reporter in last week 's Spectator magazine , ' the crowd rose for him with a fervour I 've never witnessed at a mainstream party conference .

{"text":"Some media reports state that Front National and Jobbik are already in talks with each other on how to cooperate in the European Parliament .Another of Le Pen 's new friends is Golden Dawn , which in the European election confirmed its position as Greece 's third largest party .Despite extensive legal challenges and elected officials of the party currently being incarcerated , Golden Dawn refuses to go away .More than likely , their strong support among police and the military will be enough to let them return , emboldened and empowered , to both the Greek and the European political scene .With Front National , Jobbik and Golden Dawn as their pillars , the aggressive nationalist party group in the European Parliament could indeed turn out to be a vehicle for the rebirth of European fascism .The deciding factor will be where Europe 's rapidly rising patriotic parties will land .This is a different breed than the aggressive nationalists , consisting of Euro - skeptic parties , best exemplified by Britain 's UKIP .There is now a whole range of parties in Europe that fall into this category , such as PVV in the Netherlands , Danish People 's Party , Swedish Democrats , True Finns , Alternative for Germany and Austria 's People 's Party .Some of these parties did remarkably well : both UKIP and the Danish People 's Party won their countries ' respective European Parliament elections .The Swedish Democrats scored almost ten percent of the votes , double what they got in the national elections in 2010 .Alternative for Germany surprised many by capturing as much as seven percent of the votes , while there was disappointment among PVV supporters in the Netherlands as their party only got 13 percent and a third place .It is not an exaggeration to say that this new group of patriotic parties holds Europe 's fate in their hands .Their ideological foundation spans from \" basically libertarian \" as Nigel Farage once called UKIP to welfare - statist Swedish Democrats .But they all have in common that they are committed to traditional , European parliamentary principles .This sets them apart from the aggressive nationalists whose political visions do not exclude a new full - scale fascist experiment .If some of the patriotic parties are lured into cooperation with Front National , Jobbik and Syriza , there is a significant risk that Europe , within the next five years , will see a continent - wide fascist movement .There are other aggressive nationalist parties lurking in the political backwoods , ready to capitalize on voter disgruntlement with existing political options .Among those , Germany 's National Democratic Party , NDP , actually captured on seat in the European Parliament this time around .With the history of Front National in mind , only imagination sets boundaries to what the NPD can accomplish .Another example is the Party of the Swedes .Originally called the National Socialist Front and merged with violence - prone Swedish Resistance Movement , the Party of the Swedes is waiting for the patriotic , parliamentarian Swedish Democrats to fail to deliver on their voters ' Euro - skepticism .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"97.192665"}
