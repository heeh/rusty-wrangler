{"text":"By Meghan Keneally .A revealing new map has made it clear where hundreds of hate groups are based in the United States , showing how racist and radical groups are still largely found in the South but the number of groups has multiplied dramatically since President Obama too office .The Southern Poverty Law Center has released a ' hate map ' last week which shows the national distribution of the various groups that they could confirm .The overall number of groups actually dropped from 1,007 in 2012 to 939 in 2013- the last full year with available data- but one of their more troubling observations is that some of the far - right leaning groups have had their ideologies picked up by conservative Republican politicians .Many states have varying bands of hate groups , but for their map , the SPLC qualified them into eight categories : black separatist , neo - confederate , Christian identity , racist skinhead , white nationalist , neo - Nazi , Ku Klux Klan and general hate .There is only one state- Hawaii- that has no known hate groups but a vast majority of the rest can be found below the Mason Dixon line .The 11 states that make up the area between Texas and the Atlantic are home to 589 of the 939 active groups that the SPLC identified- a whopping nearly 63 per cent .Though Florida hosts 58 groups and Texas has 57 , they do not take the top slot this year .You too ?It seems like the whole country is just filled with hate groups .Me , I 'm hating .My view on this ... .I get the impression that the neo - confederates are typically the more \" genteel \" racists .They try to gain political power through alliances with the GOP ( especially in the South , it seems like it 's good republican politics to be friendly to Daughters of the Confederacy and various other groups ) .But the way the party and its mouthpieces are going , it 's growing more tolerant of white - nationalists as well - which seems to be what the teabagger wing is largely made of .Neo - Nazis are tougher for the GOP to coalesce with , because that does n't exactly help the party in making inroads with conservative Jews .In most parts of the country , the KKK look like clowns - probably even among many racists .Those pointy hats and robes look silly and hurt them from being taken seriously .But with demographic changes , there are many that are probably sympathetic to some or many of their beliefs .I think most of the old Klan has been absorbed into many of these many Neo Confederate groups .After all , as Lee Atwater said the GOP ca n't run around yelling \" N - er , N - er , N - er \" .The Racist Skinheads and Neo - Nazis are definitely the most violent of the bunch so law enforcement is usually on them .The Skinheads main power base seems to be in prisons .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"57.91808"}

Bush for ordering a warrantless domestic spying program .The resolution ( S.Res.398 ) was co - sponsored by Sens .Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) , Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) and John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , and did not receive a floor vote .In July , 2007 , Feingold again moved to censure President Bush , this time targeting Vice President Cheney and others as well .[ 1 ] Feingold 's second effort included two measures , one focusing on the war in Iraq , and the other on domestic issues like wiretapping .[ 2 ] .Feingold 's arguments on the Senate floor .In his remarks before the Senate on March 13 , 2006 , Feingold argued : . \"The President violated the law , ignored the Constitution and the other two branches of government , and disregarded the rights and freedoms upon which our country was founded .No one questions whether the government should wiretap suspected terrorists .Of course we should , and we can under current law .If there were a demonstrated need to change that law , Congress could consider that step .But instead the President is refusing to follow that law while offering the flimsiest of arguments to justify his misconduct .He must be held accountable for his actions . \"\" The President 's claims of inherent executive authority , and his assertions that the courts have approved this type of activity , are baseless ...But it is one thing to make a legal argument that has no real support in the law .It is much worse to do what the President has done , which is to make misleading statements about what prior Presidents have done and what courts have approved , to try to make the public believe his legal arguments are much stronger than they are . \"\" None of the President 's arguments explains or excuses his conduct , or the NSA 's domestic spying program .Not one .It is hard to believe that the President has the audacity to claim that they do . \"\" Passing a resolution to censure the President is a way to hold this President accountable .A resolution of censure is a time - honored means for the Congress to express the most serious disapproval possible , short of impeachment , of the Executive 's conduct .It is different than passing a law to make clear that certain conduct is impermissible or to cut off funding for certain activities .Both of those alternatives are ways for Congress to affect future action .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"61.49656"}

{"text":"IR : An allied neo - Confederate argument is that Abraham Lincoln was a virulent racist , far worse than most Southerners .Simpson : Oddly enough , neo - Confederates make common cause with blacks such as Lerone Bennett , who , in a recent book that is rather selective , recites the old Lincoln - is - a - racist notion .There 's no doubt Abraham Lincoln harbored racial prejudices , and there 's also no doubt that he questioned them , sometimes publicly .After all , Lincoln was Southern - born , and had a lot of Southern influences in his early life .What 's important is not that Lincoln had racial prejudices , but that he struggled to overcome them , and that whatever his prejudices , he abhorred slavery .That 's very clear .He struggled to find ways to end slavery within the bounds of the Constitution ; it was the war that empowered Lincoln to act in ways he never could have acted otherwise , by allowing him to strike against slavery using presidential war powers .Lincoln is often derided as being some sort of dictator - tyrant in the White House , but I think he actually toed the Constitutional line a lot more carefully than people give him credit for .He respected [ the legality of ] slavery in states which had not seceded , and worked in other ways to secure emancipation there .In Delaware , he went so far as to draft a constitutional amendment for the state constitution to end slavery with compensation for slaveholders , although that fell apart .Lincoln also worked behind the scenes to help emancipation in Maryland , and in 1864 Maryland did abolish slavery on its own .So Lincoln did work to help emancipation in the border [ slave ] states that stayed in the union .IR : The flip side of their take on Lincoln is that two key Confederate military leaders , Robert E. Lee and Nathan Bedford Forrest , were essentially non - racist .In the case of Forrest , neo - Confederates virtually never mention the fact that after the war , he became the first imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan .The LOS , in fact , recently helped to erect a statue of Forrest , who is seen as a great hero .Simpson : The Lee myth - Lee being above slavery , Lee being in fact anti - slavery - is essential to the neo - Confederate argument that it 's not about race , it 's not about slavery .They 've done a very good job of covering up Robert E. Lee 's actual positions on this .Well , in 1864 , black Union troops were involved in operations against Lee 's army outside Richmond and Petersburg , and some of them are taken prisoner .Lee puts them to work on Confederate entrenchments that are in Union free - fire zones .When Grant gets wind of this , he threatens to put Confederate prisoners to work on Union entrenchments under Confederate fire unless Lee pulls out .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"83.83966"}

Helper , argued that non - slaveholding Southern whites ought to wake up to their economic exploitation by slaveholding whites .That 's the kind of message that many slaveholding whites took to heart , and so they spoke about reopening the international slave trade with the idea that if you increase the supply , you lower the price .The people most vociferously opposed to this were the residents of Virginia .The reason was self - serving .As of 1860 , the second most important export of the commonwealth of Virginia was human flesh .Virginians wanted to make sure that if white Southerners were going to buy slaves , they were going to buy slaves that bore the phrase \" made in Virginia . \" IR : What do you make of the neo - Confederate emphasis on northern racism ?Simpson : Let 's start by saying they have a point .Racism against African - Americans was a national problem , not a regional problem .The white South could never have gotten away with as much as it did in terms of white supremacy had there not been a large number of white Northerners who supported racist policies .But now neo - Confederates say , \" Well , you guys were racist , too , and in fact the real racism is in the North . \"And at the same time , they say , \" There is no racism in the South .\" Well , you really ca n't have it both ways .But again , the war is fought not over racial equality - at least among American whites - but over slavery , the political advantages that white Southerners had because of slavery .The war is about slavery and its political and economic impact on American society , not just Southern society .Southerners are very much aware when they support secession in 1860 - 61 that they are seceding to protect slavery and white supremacy - and that that is something that should interest not only slaveholders but also non - slaveholding whites .The neo - Confederates construct an \" other \" of mainstream academic scholarship that supposedly says that the North fought to end slavery and that the South was uniquely racist .But you do n't find a lot of mainstream scholars who embrace any of that .In fact , most mainstream academics embrace the idea that racism was an American problem , and that Union soldiers went to war in 1861 primarily to save the Union , not to destroy slavery .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"93.87355"}
