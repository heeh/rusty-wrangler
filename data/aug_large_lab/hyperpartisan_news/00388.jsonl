Interestingly , Fonzie and Mr. C. were the only two characters who appeared in every episode of Happy Days .The All American Family .The Happy Days plot was simple , a close resemblance to the popular family sitcoms of the 1950s with a bit of satire thrown into the mix .Richie Cunningham is a high school student in Milwaukee , Wisconsin .His father , Howard Cunningham ( Tom Bosley ) runs a hardware store .Richie 's mother , Marion Cunningham ( Marion Ross ) is a stay - at - home mom who does her best to run a tight household amid the usual teenage dramas .Richie also has a younger sister , Joanie Cunningham ( Erin Moran ) who becomes a major player later in the show when Fonzie 's cousin Chachi ( Scott Baio ) is added to the cast and falls in love with Joanie .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"73.212204"}

{"text":"\" The fact that Caine is Chinese and in the Old West is a problem in itself as the Chinese were forced to endure tremendous prejudice , particularly when they were hired by the railroads to work for lower wages .Caine does not limit his use of Kung Fu to defend the Chinese , though .He will protect anyone who is threatened or in danger .Unfortunately , this means he is constantly on the move to avoid retaliation .David Carradine as Caine , a man of peace , in the television cult show Kung Fu .Life in the West is even more difficult for a man raised to be a monk as Caine 's life quest is to find peace .He lives for truth and goodness .He is patient and shows great humility .He will only kill if forced to defend himself or someone who is victimized from death , only with great reluctance .In the words of David Carradine , quoted in Cult TV , \" Caine has a great \" reverence for all life .\" It is these qualities that made him so appealing to the Flower Children of the 1960s and early 70s .Kung Fu was also positive education for children in the 1970s because Caine fought for the weak , the victimized , the oppressed , and he always won .More importantly , Caine taught children self - control and the advantages of living a peaceful life .In fact , I believe Caine was adored by children who developed a Kung Fu style of communication in the 1970s .Schoolchildren across America would reply to their friends and parents by placing their palms together in front of their chest and saying , \" Of course , Master .\" The appropriate way to respond to a question was to ask a question .\" Do you hear the wind , Grasshopper ?Do you hear the water rushing in the stream , Grasshopper ?That is your answer .\" Everyone was a \" Grasshopper . \"Kung Fu talk was great fun !As a teen , I had a secret crush on Caine .I never missed an episode of Kung Fu .If Caine were a man , I would marry him .( Insert sigh here . )David Carradine , who plays Caine in the show , comes from a family of famous film and television stars .John Carradine had three sons : David , Keith , and Robert , all famous actors in their own right .Not surprisingly , the equally skilled actress Martha Plimpton is his granddaughter , daughter of Keith Carradine .Each of these actors has their own style and appeal , and are equally successful in film and TV .When the producers chose David Carradine for this role , they not only chose a star with the perfect personality and skill to carry this role , they also cast his family name .In her memoir , Bruce Lee : The Only Man I Knew , Bruce Lee 's wife , Linda , claims Paramount stole the idea for Kung Fu from her husband .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"106.8624"}
{"text":"Sexual Harassment Accusers : Not Automatic Saints Or Sinners .By : Lloyd Marcus .Liberal feminist attorney , Gloria Allred held a press conference in which her female client made shocking graphic sexual harassment allegations against Herman Cain .Sharon Bialek described a Herman Cain totally alien to the man I know .Think about this folks .Suppose someone came out of nowhere to make totally out - of - character sexual harassment allegations against your dad , pastor , husband or friend .You would give your dad , pastor , husband or friend the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise .This is called loyalty and friendship .You would not go along with the politically correct way of thinking by demanding your dad , pastor , husband or friend prove they are not guilty .You would insist the burden of proof be placed squarely on their accuser where it rightfully belongs .I mean , we are talking about possibly destroying a priceless possession , one 's reputation .When Republicans or Conservatives are accused of sexual harassment , the left says the facts do not matter ; only the seriousness of the charge .The arrogance and hypocrisy of the left continues to amaze me .ALL the women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment were called liars and sluts by the left and the Clinton administration .Paula Jones sued Bill Clinton for sexual harassment .Gloria Allred never came to the defense of Paula Jones or ANY of Clinton 's numerous accusers .Clinton was given a pass because he is a liberal Democrat .The left which includes the National Organization for Women and the liberal media are not about empowering women as they claim .They are really about furthering liberalism and a socialistic / progressive agenda .If the left truly cared about empowering women , they would not despise Sarah Palin as they do .Palin should be their poster girl ; the epitome of a powerful successful woman both inside and outside side of the home .My comments have nothing to do with defending Cain as a presidential candidate .While I hold Cain in high regard , I have not formally endorsed anyone .However , I smell the disgusting putrid odor of the left attempting to destroy ANOTHER black conservative .Does the name Clarence Thomas ring a bell ?They failed .But the battle was brutal .The liberal media tried to assist the Democrats by digging deep into Thomas ' life including investigating the movies he rented from his local video store .Their desperate quest was to find anything they could use to destroy Thomas ' character .Anita Hill 's graphic claim of a pubic hair on a soda can will live forever in infamy .Stay tuned folks for a Cain accuser to surface with allegations of a pubic hair on a pizza .The liberal media 's enthusiastic attack and attempt to destroy Cain , a black conservative , is deja vu all over again .In both incidences , the black conservatives were on the threshold of winning extremely powerful positions based on their merit rather than the left 's sacred cow , Affirmative Action .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"108.55184"}
