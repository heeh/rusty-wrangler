Perkins , Associate Deputy Director , Federal Bureau of Investigation , Joint Statement with Department of Justice Associate Deputy Attorney General Carlos Uriarte Before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Washington , D.C. .Good afternoon Mr. Chairman , ranking members , and members of the subcommittees .I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the FBI 's efforts to combat recent violence along the South Texas border with Mexico .The region between the Texas cities of Del Rio and Brownsville has experienced high levels of drug - related turmoil since 2003 .The focal point of much of this activity is Nuevo Laredo , Mexico , a border city situated directly across the Rio Grande River from Laredo , Texas .Drug traffickers have exacted an especially bloody toll in Nuevo Laredo and neighboring Mexican towns .Significant levels of violence and drug - related criminal activity also plague Laredo .As you know , this bloody drama revolves around the Gulf Cartel drug - trafficking organization , which dominates the region and commands smuggling operations along this stretch of the American Southwest .One of their enforcement groups , known as Los Zetas , bears primary responsibility for the violence .They have been fighting a turf war on behalf of the Gulf Cartel against rival drug trafficking organizations .Because the Bureau focuses on large - scale enterprise investigations that target the command and control structures of criminal groups , we are well suited to help dismantle these trafficking organizations .Kidnappings .One of the most significant ramifications of the unrest along the border has been a string of kidnappings involving U.S. citizens .Between May 2004 and May 2005 , there have been 35 reported abductions of U.S. citizens in this region ( much larger numbers of Mexican citizens have been abducted along the border .From January to mid - August 2005 , 202 kidnappings occurred in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas , the Gulf Cartel 's operational center , which includes the cities of Matamoros , Nuevo Laredo , and Reynosa . )Thirty - four of these abductions occurred in Nuevo Laredo and involved U.S. citizens who had crossed the border .Twenty - three victims were released by their captors , nine victims remain missing , and two are confirmed dead .These numbers likely represent only a fraction of the actual occurrences , because many kidnappings of U.S. citizens go unreported .There are two reasons for the underreporting of abductions along the border .First , victims and their families fear reprisal from kidnappers .Second , since many victims are alleged to be involved in drug trafficking , they and their families are reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement .The San Antonio Division has 26 pending kidnapping cases .We have offered all available resources to assist Mexican law enforcement and have followed every domestic lead to locate the U.S. kidnapping victims .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"64.02783"}
