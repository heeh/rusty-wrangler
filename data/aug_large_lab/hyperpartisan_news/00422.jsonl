{"text":"As a result , when a woman found herself pregnant in spite of her best efforts to prevent conception , children were viewed as an \" accident \" , the failure of contraception .Something went wrong .This mentality would \" prime the pump \" and even necessitate access to abortion on demand .Blessed John Paul II observed in Evangelium vitae , \" [ t]he life which could result from a sexual encounter thus becomes an enemy to be avoided at all costs , and abortion becomes the only possible decisive response to failed contraception . \"A solution had to be found ; abortion access was necessary to \" clean up the mess .\" Ironically , it is often claimed that contraception reduces the need for abortion , but the sordid history and abortion numbers that climb with contraception access tell a very different story .The expansion or legalization of abortion in a country is almost always preceded by introduction or acceptance of contraception .Contraception is the proverbial Trojan Horse .The contraceptive mentality - a de facto tendency against life - has led to a wider acceptance of and reliance upon abortion .Blessed John Paul II recognized this : \" the negative values inherent in the ' contraceptive mentality' ... are such that they in fact strengthen this temptation when an unwanted life is conceived .Indeed , the pro - abortion culture is especially strong precisely where the Church 's teaching on contraception is rejected .\" Contraception is no solution to abortion , but is instead , intimately connected , \" fruits of the same tree . \"Skeptical ?In short , the court maintains that abortion was a necessary fixture of American society because the intimate relationships of Americans are wholly dependent upon contraception , which often fails them .Hopefully John Paul II was right when he wrote in 1995 that \" [ t]he close connection which exists , in mentality , between the practice of contraception and that of abortion is becoming increasingly obvious . \"Greater awareness of the obvious is necessary if we are to successfully reverse the contraceptive mentality and the continuing scourge of abortion .Editor 's note : The image above of the empty playground is taken from Shutterstock .Abortion indeed has left a devastating trail : \" The disastrous effect on society , marriage , families , women , and of course , the unborn , can not be minimized . \" The packaging , selling and distribution of \" greater awareness \" that contradicts the messages we are inundated with by ubiquitous media is the hurdle .Alecto .Strange that Mr. Nichols chose to omit from the article the disastrous effects on men as well .Are n't they an integral part of this story ?Or , perhaps the \" contraceptive \" mentality is exactly what appealed to men ?Whatever the effects on women , men are able to live the Peter Pan existence so many of them desire to live these days .And that life without consequences is dominant among the average American male .They all have one thing in common : they are n't family men !","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"94.11451"}
{"text":"If you go round to a feminists house u can guarantee they wo n't have done any washing up for a week .They would n't of course so our places would be just filled with unwashed dishes .Feminism begins and ends with gross generalisations and if you argue back they start off with ' women this women that etc etc blah blah ' therebye putting you in a position of being anti - woman if u discuss things .What it reminds me of is the Nazis who stated that if u dislike nazis then you are anti - German .By claiming to speak for all women they show themselves to have a totalitarian mindset .Another thing that draws the poison is neo paganism , which i started reading about awhile back .Most feminists will understand paganism , which includes Wicca witchcraft etc and what paganism says is that there is a God and a Goddess and they are both EQUAL , Isis and Osiris Freya and Odin etc etc u get the idea .Paganism reveres the feminine and the Masculine Deity .I recently told a feminist that I used to be a male feminist but i learned differently and changed my views .she asked why and I answered after discovering Goddess Spirituality she had no answer what so ever !Alongside this , is the idea that feminism has been encouraged in order to break up relationships and to make them more difficult to get in the first place .The reason for this is that lonely , lovelorn people are anxious and unhappy and seek comfort through consumerism and high spending .What is sinister is how deeply feminism has sunk into establishment and media opinion moulders .An example of this is a recent programme on the BBC radio 4 ( British ' highbrow ' radio ) called Moral Maze .There was a discussion about rape/ consent amongst young men and women .There were 3 men on the panal and 1 woman .The men were all taking the feminist ' all men are rapists ' line and the woman was saying that things are not that clear - cut and when drink , inexperience and other factors are taken into account the reasons are not always that straight forward .The 3 men accused this 1 woman of having a ' male perspective ' which was meant as a put - down .They really could n't see the irony in waht they were saying or the situation as it was in their studio .What does worry me is the negative effect that it has on young boys , teenagers and young adults .Several generations now who havre grown up not knowing how to relate to each other in a sharing and loving way , The younger men are the victims of this but i think it has a destructive effect on the girls too .Again i believe the effect is to encourage people to become high consumers to compensate for the unhappiness that they feel . \" The devil does n't mind being mocked , if he has the last laugh when he gets your SOUL .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"95.65248"}
