{"text":"Glenn Beck vs. Frances Fox Piven .In the wake of the Tucson shootings , conservative pundit and Fox News television host Glenn Beck called upon all Americans to reject violence .Beck also reached out to members of Congress to sign a pledge repudiating all violence .The pledge listed examples of the type of violence that should be denounced , ranging from far right - wing militias to leftist Frances Fox Piven 's calls for violent revolution .Sadly , a mere 14 lawmakers signed on to the pledge .What 's worse than such a pitiful display of anti - violent solidarity , however , is that the mainstream media has latched onto Beck 's targeting of Frances Fox Piven and is now perpetrating a battle between Beck and Piven .Since his start on the Fox News channel two years ago , Beck has exposed Francis Fox Piven 's strategy to overwhelm the government welfare rolls and collapse the system .He has also indicated that Piven 's strategy of overloading the system involves necessary violence .Stanley Kurtz of the National Review explains Piven 's violent stance : .Calls for the escalation and manipulation of violent rioting have long been central to Piven 's strategy .Her 1977 book with Cloward , Poor People 's Movements : Why They Succeed , How They Fail , detailed the rationale behind the infamous crisis strategy of a decade before .The core argument is that the poor and unemployed are so isolated from the levers of power in America that their greatest potential impact is to withhold \" quiescence in civil life : they can riot .\" At the heart of the book , Cloward and Piven luxuriously describe instances of \" mob looting , \" \" rent riots , \" and similar disruptions , egged on especially by Communist - party organizers in the 1930s .Many of those violent protests resulted in injuries .A few led to deaths .The central argument of Poor People 's Movements is that it was not formal democratic activity but violent disruptions inspired by leftist organizers that forced the first great expansion of the welfare state .Toward the end of the book , when Cloward and Piven describe their own work with the National Welfare Rights Organization , they treat the violent urban rioting of the Sixties as a positive force behind the era 's expansion of the welfare state .Her calls for violence did not simply end with her book , however .Appearing at the University of Wisconsin years later , Piven addressed the use of violence in protest .She argued that protestors should try to avoid violence during protests as a means of self - defense , since violent outbursts could lead to injuries against the protestors .She also asserted that when the left uses violence , the media and conservatives could pounce on it and hold it against the protestors .As such , she declared , \" Unless you have a good reason for breaking a window , you probably should n't do that ... unless it 's part of a bigger strategy .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"80.72386"}

{"text":"Murdered Justice : An Exploratory Study of Targeted Attacks on the Justice Community .Glenn McGovern March 1 , 2013 .SUMMARY On a balmy Monday evening , July 20 , 1903 in New Orleans , Louisiana , District Attorney J. Ward Gurley was working late in his Canal Street office .At approximately 10:00 p.m. , the door opened and in walked Gurley 's former office clerk , Louis W. Lyons .The two men had previously had a falling out over Lyons ' recent arrest for theft .An argument ensued and Lyons drew a pistol and shot DA Gurley to death before turning the gun on himself1 .While Mr. Gurley might have the dubious honor of being the first documented member of the justice community to be murdered in the twentieth century , he would be far from the last .In a study of over 1300-targeted attacks occurring around the world since January 1 , 1950 , it was found that members of the Justice Community , namely judges , prosecutors and senior police officers were within the top five victim professions .In the United States , judges and law enforcement rank number one and two respectively as the most frequent specifically targeted government official .This report details the findings of a study of the sixty - three perpetrated attacks and seventy attempts occurring between January 1 , 1950 and December 31 , 2012 .The objective is to obtain a better understanding of various aspects of this type of violence , for which there has been little specific research .The study includes both completed attacks against a victim ( regardless of whether injury occurred or not ) and attempts , where the suspect was unable to launch the attack for whatever reason , including early detected and prevention by law enforcement .One of the major difficulties when investigating targeted attacks upon members of the justice community , as opposed to the more commonly encountered societal violence , is the relationship between the victim and the offender .For those whose profession it is to deal with the nefarious elements of society , threats and attempts at intimidation are not uncommon .In the vast majority of these cases , the threats are merely bully bravado , or the verbalization of the frustration of being apprehended and the current predicament .While threats are part and parcel for the job , one 's position along the process of justice tends to increase or decrease the amount that will be received .Hence , police officers are predictably the recipients ' of the majority of threats .While many criminals / defendants 1 .Reported in the July 21 , 1903 edition of the New York Times .© 2013 By Glenn McGovern All rights reserved .No part of this material may be reproduced or used in any manner without the written permission of the author . certainly possess the capability to carry out a hostile attack , they fortunately often lack the degree of intent required to carry through with their vitriol .Therein lies the conundrum for both targets and investigators , differentiating between what has been referred to as the \" hunters and the howlers \" ( Calhoun , Weston , 2006 ) , those that want to do harm , and those who are all talk .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"94.443756"}

Bernie Sanders handily defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday , but she may come out of the state on top in the delegate count due to the pre - pledged support of superdelegates .Here 's why : New Hampshire has 24 Democratic delegates distributed based on the number of votes each candidate receives .According to the Associated Press , the Vermont senator earned at least 13 of the Democratic delegates with 60 percent of the vote in the Granite State .Because New Hampshire is n't a winner - take - all state , Clinton won at least nine delegates with her 38 percent of the vote .A remaining two delegates have yet to be determined based on popular vote totals , according to AP .But New Hampshire also has eight Democratic \" superdelegates \" - party insiders who are n't bound by the popular vote outcome and can support any candidate they choose .Six of the superdelegates said before Tuesday night 's voting that they plan to support Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in July .That support is n't binding , though - superdelegates can switch candidates between now and the convention .Clinton 's Granite State superdelegates include New Hampshire Democratic lawmakers Gov. Maggie Hassan , Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Rep. Annie Kuster , according to The Hill .One of the undecided superdelegates is Ray Buckley , chairman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party , who was barred by state party rules from selecting a candidate prior to the primary in an effort to maintain neutrality .Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina have dropped out of the Republican presidential race after a very poor showing in the New Hampshire primaries .Fiorina finished 7th with 4 % of the vote and Christie finished 6th with about 7.5 % of the vote .Carly Fiorina had a short and meteoric rise as she performed strong at times during the debates , but it just never translated to a rise in the polls .With regards to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , to be honest , his run for the GOP presidential nomination was over before it began .Pundits pondered why Christie 's campaign never got traction and why even after he knee - capped establishment darling Marco Rubio showing him to be robitoc , Christie gained nada in the polls .Really , is it that hard to understand ?With all due respect to Christie , his presidential run ended when he decided to hug Barack Obama during the president 's photo - op trip to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy and what looked like a date between Obama and Christie on the boardwalk at the Jersey shore .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"97.005714"}
