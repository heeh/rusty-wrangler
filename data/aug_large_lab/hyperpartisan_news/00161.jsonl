Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he was suspending New York 's participation in a federal immigration enforcement plan that has drawn fire from immigrant advocates , civil liberties lawyers and elected officials in the state and around the country .A statement from Mr. Cuomo 's office said there was \" mounting evidence \" that the program , called Secure Communities , had not only failed to meet its goal of deporting the most serious immigrant criminals but was also undermining law enforcement and compromising public safety .\" There are concerns about the implementation of the program as well as its impact on families , immigrant communities and law enforcement in New York , \" Mr. Cuomo said .Unless those concerns are eased , the statement said , New York will not take part .Mr. Cuomo 's decision makes New York the second state to announce its intention to withdraw from the program , and sets up a confrontation with the Obama administration , which has made Secure Communities a cornerstone of immigration enforcement strategy .Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois said in May that he was canceling his state 's participation .Under the program , begun by the Bush administration in 2008 , the fingerprints of everyone booked into a local or county jail are sent to the Department of Homeland Security and compared with prints in its files .If officials find that a suspect is in the country illegally , or is a noncitizen with a criminal record , they may seek to deport the person .By Wednesday , that fingerprint sharing had been introduced in about 41 percent of the nation 's jurisdictions , including 27 of 62 counties in New York .Mr. Cuomo 's move means that those counties ' participation will end .The entire country is scheduled to join the program by 2013 .The practical effects of Mr. Cuomo 's decision are unclear .New York law enforcement agencies regularly check fingerprints with the Federal Bureau of Investigation .Homeland Security officials said that regardless of New York 's participation in Secure Communities , the F.B.I. would still share fingerprints with the immigration agency .Federal officials said that if states did not share fingerprints with the F.B.I. , those states would lose access to federal criminal databases , undermining their ability to fight crime .While Secure Communities has contributed to a sharp rise in deportations under President Obama , it does not appear to have won him many allies .It has angered immigrants who supported Democrats in recent elections .It has also failed to convince many of the president 's Republican opponents that he is sufficiently committed to enforcement .Opponents of the program contend that even though it was mainly intended to ensnare convicted criminals and people deemed a security threat , it has instead caught too many immigrants charged with low - level crimes or guilty only of being in the country illegally .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"47.21431"}

{"text":"This attitude is encouraged by certain influential national organizations , including the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the International Association of Chiefs of Police .The mayor and police chief of Providence , R.I. , recently invoked \" the chilling effect \" argument to defend their city 's failure to make use of ICE 's Law Enforcement Support Center to screen arrested aliens .In 2008 this policy resulted in the release of an illegal alien offender wanted by ICE , who has since been accused of kidnapping and raping a local woman in a public park .The origins of the \" chilling effect \" theory are unclear , and hard evidence of the phenomenon is non - existent in crime statistics , social science research , or real - life law enforcement experience .In fact , immigrants reporting crime are one of the main ways ICE launches investigations against criminal aliens - especially in gang cases .One veteran immigration agent told us , \" During my 27 years of experience , 99 percent of our information and leads came from the alien community , either because they had been a victim of crime or had been denied work . \" While rumors abound of illegal aliens who allegedly refrain from reporting crimes out of fear of deportation , we could find no substantiated cases of crime victims who were removed as a result of having reported crimes to authorities unless the victims turned out to be criminals as well .Agencies who shun contact with ICE are denying themselves and victims the opportunity to take advantage of these provisions .For example , someone who is a victim of a gang crime ( or any crime ) who happens to be an illegal alien might be needed to testify or otherwise assist in the prosecution of the criminal .If the alien lacks status , he is subject to removal at any time .To ensure that does not happen , the local agency should seek ICE 's help in arranging special status , temporary or otherwise , until the case is resolved .Common sense suggests that these tools represent a much more powerful way to encourage cooperation from the immigrant community than non - cooperation or sanctuary policies .The most authoritative statistics on crime reporting fail to support the \" chilling effect \" theory .First of all , non - reporting of crime is a problem throughout the country and across racial and ethnic lines .According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) surveys on crime victimization and reporting , only about 50 percent of all crimes are ever reported to police .Furthermore , Hispanics are actually slightly more likely than non - Hispanics to report crimes .For example , in 2005 , the most recent year available , Hispanics reported 51 percent of all violent crimes to police , while non - Hispanics reported 47 percent .59 While the Hispanic cohort is not a perfect proxy for immigrants , if immigrants as a group truly were less likely to report crimes than the native population , it would be apparent in these statistics , because Hispanics are significantly more likely to be immigrants than non - Hispanics .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"66.52031"}

{"text":"According to ICE investigators , some gangsters start planning their return while still locked up in the United States .Without better border control , the public safety gains from Operation Community Shield will be as fleeting as those from late 1990s , when the gang members who were removed soon returned .The good news is that ICE and federal prosecutors are collaborating more often now to bring re - entry charges against those who return after being deported .Second , while interior enforcement efforts have increased noticeably in recent years , the funding and staffing of ICE remain inadequate to the huge scale of the illegal alien and criminal alien problem .ICE currently employs about 11,200 investigative special agents and enforcement ( removal ) agents to deal with a population of more than 11 million illegal aliens , and hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens .Removals have increased significantly , and the agency is beginning to make a dent in both the fugitive illegal alien and the criminal alien populations .In addition , ICE has recently restored workplace enforcement to its list of top priorities , undertaking significant initiatives targeting some of the most egregious employers .ICE 's stated policy of tackling \" the worst of the worst \" leaves a lot of the worst still cycling through the streets and the jails , at considerable cost to state and local government .Any steps taken at the federal level to enhance border security , deter illegal settlement , and cause illegal aliens to return home will indirectly help with the immigrant gang problem .In addition , some specific steps can be taken at the federal level to directly aid immigration law enforcement directed at gangs : .Provide Stable and Adequate Funding for ICE Operations .Congress must continue to provide ICE with adequate funding to sustain Operation Community Shield .It was launched without designated funding , but recent moves by Congressional appropriators have raised concerns about ICE 's ability to sustain such programs .For example , appropriators in the U.S. House of Representatives this year moved to severely limit the types of enforcement operations ICE can undertake .The House version of this year 's appropriations bill seeks to force ICE to focus only on illegal aliens who have been convicted of \" dangerous \" crimes .Such restrictions would leave state and local gang units in the lurch and without assistance from ICE until gangsters are convicted of such crimes of murder , rape , assault , etc .In addition , they would shield green card - holding criminal gangsters from ICE action .Deny Immigration Benefits to Gangsters .Few provisions exist in immigration law to bar gang members from obtaining U.S. residency or relief from removal , unless they have been convicted of an aggravated felony .Congress has considered several measures in bills that would add criminal street gang activity to the list of offenses making an alien inadmissible or ineligible for status , or subject to mandatory detention while in removal proceedings .Some of these proposals were casualties of the comprehensive immigration reform bill rejected by Congress in 2007 ( the same bill that would have provided amnesty to illegal alien gang members who promised to leave the gang ) .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"74.636925"}

{"text":"But the possibility of avoiding removal creates an entirely different dynamic , especially if the informant 's assistance is suspected or known by other gang members , meaning return to El Salvador could be a death sentence .In this case , the informant would have some incentive to please the local prosecutor , but far more incentive to please the controlling ICE agent .The following is a summary of the most effective - yet surprisingly underutilized by state and local law enforcement - immigration law incentives and protections for informants , cooperating witnesses , intelligence assets , and victims .These are listed in order from the most basic to the most powerful incentives .Significant Public Benefit Parole ( SPBP ) .This option , administered by ICE headquarters , is designed to provide victims , witnesses , and cooperators with a quasi - lawful immigration status on a temporary basis .From an administrative or \" paperwork \" standpoint , SPBP is considered to be one of the easiest immigration incentives to obtain on behalf of a partnering law enforcement agency .In addition , because it can be cancelled at any time by the control agent , with immediate consequences for the alien ( e.g. detention with no bail ) , it provides law enforcement authorities with some leverage if the individual proves to be uncooperative .There is no statutory limit to the number of SPBPs that can be issued .Employment Authorization Document ( EAD ) .This document provides work authorization , so that an informant who lacks legal status may legally hold a job while the case plays out .S Visa .In 1997 , at the prompting of the Department of Justice and other federal law enforcement agencies , Congress recognized that alien informants presented a unique set of circumstances for which existing witness protection programs were not sufficient , and created the \" S \" non - immigrant visa program .The program has a statutory limit of 200 principal applicants ( plus family ) for criminal investigations or prosecutions and 50 principal applicants for counter - terrorism cases .Unlike SPBP , this visa provides a clear path to permanent residency and citizenship for the informant .The controlling agent may request that the S visa informant be allowed to adjust to permanent residency after a period of just one year .To prevent the handling agency from using the informant indefinitely , the individual must be granted permanent residency within three years , or the law enforcement agency must discontinue the relationship .The S visa does not require a conviction , direct testimony by the cooperator , or even that the cooperator play an active role in the investigation , but merely that he /she provide sufficient , credible information to predicate a criminal case opening .U Visa .The \" U \" visa was created by Congress in 2000 to encourage illegal alien victims of crimes such as human trafficking , domestic violence , and certain other crimes to come forward and report their victimization without fear of removal .A total of 10,000 may be issued each year , and the visa holder is eligible to become a permanent resident after three years .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"82.228264"}

{"text":"Because the ultimate goal of OCS is to bring down the gang leadership and organization , as well as to arrest individual criminals , every gangster arrested is treated as a potential informant for knowledge of the larger gang structure and activity .Here , too , the unique immigration law authorities bring important tools that are not available to other law enforcement agencies .The prospect of removal , while not truly punishment compared to a lengthy prison sentence , can be a powerful incentive for alien gangsters to cooperate with authorities .ICE agents also can offer certain protections to illegal alien offenders who become valuable assets on investigations , as explained in more detail below .Such tactics have been used successfully and repeatedly by ICE agents working closely with local gang units .In addition , immigration agents can provide numerous forms of \" genuine \" immigration documents , such as green cards , work permits , border crossing cards , etc . for use by investigators in penetrating a specific conspiracy and nabbing criminal aliens in the process .For example , an undercover agent might provide a document to a narcotics trafficker in exchange for drugs , thereby enhancing the credibility of the agent and his ability to penetrate the conspiracy .In this case , the law enforcement agencies obtain some of the best evidence possible by providing something that the targets need and are willing to pay for , often with contraband that constitutes substantive violations of the law , while also providing intelligence on the conspiracy itself .In some cases , the targets unwittingly will provide their own biometric identification , such as a photograph or fingerprint , which serves as significant evidence against them in court .Information contained in immigration files can be of great importance in providing evidence at bail hearings as to the defendant 's track record of failures to appear for immigration proceedings .This information can help the judge make a more informed decision about whether or not to permit a defendant to post bail .Finally , and perhaps most obviously , immigration agents can bring about the removal of criminal gangsters from the community and have them returned to their home country .This step has profound public safety benefits , as the offenders are deported rather than recycled through the criminal justice system with a strong likelihood of committing further crimes .In addition , state and local governments save money by reducing the case load of probation and parole services .However , ICE believes strongly that removal should not be lieu of a sentence of incarceration for the purpose of expediency , but rather should happen at the end of the sentence , so that the alien receives punishment and the criminal charges can provide the basis for removal .Protections Encourage Cooperation .In addition to investigative tools , the involvement of an immigration special agent can spur cooperation of informants or witnesses that might otherwise be difficult to obtain .More traditional types of incentives used by law enforcement usually involve monetary rewards or mitigating a criminal charge or punishment .The immigration law tools can supplement these methods and at times act as an even greater incentive in the case of a foreign national .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"93.07484"}
