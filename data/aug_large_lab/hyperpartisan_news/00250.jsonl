Bush , campaigning next to him for the first time .Saturday , expect to hear Bush make an explicit case for why he is the best to take on Trump or Cruz -- and even remind people of his family 's history of winning here .He 's the last Republican that was president .He is the most popular Republican alive , \" Bush told reporters Thursday . \"He has made tough decisions as president .All of that , I think , is important for people to be reminded of .Winning the military and veterans ' votes .Two constituencies in South Carolina will be key in determining the winner of the GOP South Carolina primary : military personnel and veterans .The state is home to more than 400,000 veterans and some 38,000 active duty military members , according to recent estimates .That means issues like national security , military spending and the treatment of veterans are likely to be front and center at Saturday 's debate .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"93.4597"}
