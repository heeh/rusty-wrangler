{"text":"Instead of being slaves to white Southern plantation owners , blacks today are slaves to the Democratic - envisioned welfare state created by the federal government .Instead of a hand up , their views are truly a constant hand out because it is bribery for votes .Unfortunately , the black community has fallen for it hook , line and sinker .Today , black Republican leaders like Tim Scott , Alan West and Herman Cain are considered \" Oreos- \" black on the outside and white on the inside .Fortunately for the Republican Party , it has been proven that one can lose more than 90 % of the black vote yet still win a state 's electoral votes .That is because despite the fact that blacks make up a large portion of the population of certain states , or certain parts of other states , they still can not overcome other constituencies .In fact , that is part and parcel of the Democratic strategy with respect to Hispanics .By putting the same yoke of slavery around the necks of Hispanics , they can join with the blacks to potentially overcome Republican dominance in certain states and change the balance in electoral politics .This is obvious in swing states like Florida and , increasingly , Georgia and Virginia .These states have large existing black populations and growing Hispanic populations .Having looked at the genesis of this problem and where it stands today , the first remedial step is to realize that the Republican Party will never garner a majority of the black vote even if a black is the Republican Presidential candidate .Instead , the goal needs to be merely making inroads into the currently large existing gap .If the GOP could get anywhere near the 38 % of the black vote Nixon received in 1968 or 1972 , then it would be a huge success .Simply dropping Democratic support into the low-80 % range is a success !That is good since it allows for slow , incremental change .The first plank has to be a re - education of the black community .For 40 years now , the black vote has been monolithically Democratic .In those 40 years , there have certainly been advances by blacks .But , have Democratic policies and programs led to black equality ?Even under a black Democratic President , unemployment in the black community is double the national rate and black household income has fallen greater than that of others .It is simply a reiteration of that old adage : the Democratic Party gives blacks a fish so they can eat for the day ( or four years in political time ) ; the Republican Party offers the tools to fish for a lifetime .Every black needs to look inwards and ask themselves honestly whether they are any better off under Obama , or even Carter or Clinton for that matter .That is because Republicans have essentially internalized the dream of Martin Luther King 's color blind society while Democrats continue a policy of racial polarization .They do so because the more vocal voices in the black community has fallen for the quick fix of a government hand out .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"79.16275"}
