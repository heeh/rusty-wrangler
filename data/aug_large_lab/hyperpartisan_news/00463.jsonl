{"text":"Fleming and Maximov admit that there would be a lesser degree of control over the outpatients and this would be relevant in determining what protective measures could be taken , but they do not believe it would justify a negation of the duty .n6 Greenberg held that a state mental hospital was negligent when it denied the request for admission by an individual who suffered from homicidal delusions and afterward assaulted his private physician .Fleming and Maximov saw this as indicating that an even more compelling duty would arise if the patient had been admitted and a physician - patient relationship had been established .The following paragraph sums up the duty analysis offered by Fleming and Maximov : .While the precedents for this conclusion thus far have involved only dangerous persons under actual detention ( inpatients ) , their rationale would almost surely seem to include also a physician 's assumption of liability for outpatients .n7 .Fleming and Maximov then proceed to consider the psychotherapist 's conflicting duty to a patient .The authors contend that , although psychotherapy implies a plenary confidentiality privilege for the patient and , indeed , under California evidence statutes , psychotherapy appears to have been accorded a greater privilege than exists for other therapies , at best psychotherapy implies only a qualified privilege .Fleming and Maximov consider in detail the statutory incursion on the privilege under the California Evidence Code and the Welfare and Institution Code .Due to this qualified privilege , Fleming and Maximov believe the therapist owes an overriding duty to obtain an informed consent from the patient .This informed consent is necessary to protect the privacy , liberty , and due process rights of the patient .The impact of the qualified privilege on the field of psychotherapy is handled in a somewhat cavalier manner by Fleming and Maximov .The patients deterred by a lack of confidentiality are supposedly balanced by the patients who will now seek care under a \" cry for help \" compulsion because they know the authorities will be informed of their activities .In addition , Fleming and Maximov point to the continued success of psychotherapy in the face of the legislative inroads on confidentiality .Interference with psychotherapy is discounted further by the accounts of successful use of group therapy with resultant loss of confidentiality .Fleming and Maximov spend more time and effort supporting the patient 's rights to privacy , liberty , and due process .The gist of their argument is presented in the last paragraph of their discussion .To summarize , vital interests of all psychiatric patients are threatened by pressures on psychotherapists to take protective action when involved with potentially dangerous patients .Often patients are unaware of these threats and assume a security which is in reality unavailable .An overriding concern , therefore , is the protection of these unwary patients from self - threatening disclosures .A requirement of full disclosure and informed consent along the lines of Cobbs v.

Burnick .n15 There , an otherwise heterosexual 28-year - old man had four to six consensual homosexual acts with two boys aged 13 and 15 .In a well - written and -reasoned majority opinion , Justice Mosk extended \" the full panoply of the relevant \" due process protections to defendants in all commitment proceedings , whether they be civil or criminal .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"73.54547"}

{"text":"Despite updated psychiatric ... read more .It has been 30 years since Prosenjit Poddar met Tatiana ( Tanya ) Tarasoff and 25 years since the first Tarasoff decision was handed down by the California Supreme Court , later modified by the second Tarasoff decision . n1The occasion of the twenty - fifth anniversary of this eventful case would seem to be an appropriate time to review and appraise the effects of this widely publicized case .When first handed down , many observers thought it was an aberrant decision not likely to be followed elsewhere and likely to be severely modified by California courts .In addition , a myriad of commentators in the area of mental health decried the decision as undermining the practice of psychotherapy by destroying the tenets of confidentiality .These observers obviously were wrong .Less than two years later , the New Jersey Superior Court in McIntosh v. Milano n2 found a psychiatrist liable using the rationale of Tarasoff .Since that time , the decision requiring psychotherapists to warn third parties of potentially dangerous patients has been adopted in many jurisdictions and has been expanded to include a wide variety of health care practitioners .Because the holding in Tarasoff is still an active concept in the law and because it did not mark the death of psychotherapy practice , the question arises as to why the observers were wrong .I. BEFORE TARASOFF .It appears obvious from reading Tarasoff that the California Supreme Court 's decision was the result of the evolution of the court 's prior decisions and the \" black letter \" law at the time .Three of the sources mentioned by the court are worth exploring .The first , an article by Fleming and Maximov , entitled The Patient or His Victim : The Therapists Dilemma , n3 is frequently quoted by the court .Fleming is identified in a footnote as John G. Fleming , Shannon Cecil Turner Professor of Law , University of California , Berkeley , and Maximov is identified as Bruce Maximov , Head Article Editor , California Law Review , evidently a law student .The court 's decision seems to rely on Professor Fleming 's analysis of the status of the law before Tarasoff .How much the court relied on Fleming and Maximov becomes obvious only on reading the law review article .Fleming and Maximov published their almost monograph - length article between the time Tarasoff was heard in the court of appeals n4 and the first California Supreme Court decision .n5 It was directed specifically to the Tarasoff fact situation .Fleming and Maximov begin with an analysis of the duty to protect a third party .Special relationships were exemplified by the duty of parents to control their children so that they do not pose an unreasonable risk to others .The principle was extended to persons having control over another who , by reason of some social or mental maladjustment , was a dangerous person .The cases moved closer to the subject at hand with extension of liability to the negligent control of institutional patients with suicidal and/or homicidal tendencies .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"78.16008"}

{"text":"It is sometimes difficult to determine whether the paranoid symptoms are secondary to depressive disorder , or vice versa .Both scenarios are common .The distinction is of some importance as the two disorders differ in treatment and prognosis .A depressive disorder is likely if the mood changes occurred earlier and are of greater intensity than the paranoid features .Previous psychiatric history and family history may also be useful pointers .Finally , in depressive disorder , the patient typically accepts the persecution as justified by his own guilt or wickedness .This is a useful point clinically , since it contrasts with non - affective psychoses , wherein such persecutions are resented bitterly .Paranoid symptoms also occur in mania , and are typically mood - congruent and thus grandiose rather than persecutory .Paranoid symptoms and paranoid schizophrenia .Paranoid schizophrenia was described in Chapter 12 Its distinction from delusional disorders has been particularly problematic , both conceptually and practically ( see Box 13.2 ) , but the difficulties can be decreased by noting the differences in their core features ( compare Table 12.6 with Table 13.1 ) .Three features help in making the distinction in cases of doubt : . \" The diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia rather than delusional disorder is suggested if the paranoid delusions are particularly odd in content ( often referred to by psychiatrists as bizarre delusions ) .Except in extreme cases , judgment as to how bizarre they are must be arbitrary ( Flaum et al , 1991 ) .DSM - IV defines non - bizarre delusions as involving situations that could conceivably occur in real life , for example , being followed , poisoned , or loved at a distance .ICD- . 10 , perhaps recognizing the difficulty of defining bizarre , omits this criterion .In delusional disorder , the delusional system is also characteristically encapsulated , such that the rest of the mental state can appear remarkably normal , in contrast to schizophrenia .In delusional disorder , hallucinations are rare , and when they do occur are fleeting and clearly related to the delusions .Paranoid symptoms in schizophrenia - like syndromes .Paranoid symptoms are features of several schizophrenia - like syndromes discussed in Chapter 12 ( and listed in Table 12.5 ) .These include the DSM - IV categories of ' brief psychotic disorders ' and ' schizophreniform disorder ' , and the ICD-10 categories grouped under the heading ' acute and transient psychotic disorders ' .Delusional disorders ( paranoid psychoses ) .As mentioned in the introduction , the terminology and classification of psychoses which are neither affective , organic , nor schizophrenia , has been disputed for many years .Box 13.2 summarizes the main historical terms and themes , and provides the backdrop to the way in which the disorders are currently categorized .In this section , the core features of delusional disorders- the current terminology for these conditions - are described .The specific types of delusional disorder are covered in the following section .Page 311 DELUSIONAL DISORDERS ( PARANOID PSYCHOSES ) .BOX 13.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND : PARANOIA AND PARAPHRENIA .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"82.09648"}
{"text":"The term paranoid can be applied to symptoms , syndromes , or personality types .Paranoid symptoms are overvalued ideas or delusions which are most commonly persecutory but not always so ( Box 1.2 , p. 11 ) .Paranoid syndromes are those in which paranoid delusions form a prominent part of a characteristic constellation of symptoms , such as pathological jealousy or erotomania .In paranoid personality disorder , there is excessive self - reference and undue sensitiveness to real or imaginary humiliations and rebuffs , often combined with selfimportance and combativeness .Thus the term paranoid is descriptive ; if we recognize a symptom or syndrome as paranoid , this is not making a diagnosis , but it is a preliminary to doing so .In this respect it is like recognizing stupor or depersonalization .Paranoid syndromes present considerable problems of classification and diagnosis .The difficulties can be reduced by dividing them into two distinct groups : .Paranoid symptoms occurring as part of another psychiatric disorder , such as schizophrenia , mood disorder , or an organic mental disorder .Paranoid symptoms occurring without evidence for any underlying disorder .This group of disorders has gone by a variety of names , commonly paranoid states or paranoid psychosis , but the ICD-10 and DSM - IV category is delusional disorder .It is this second group that has caused persistent difficulties in several respects ; for example , regarding its terminology , relationship to schizophrenia , and forensic implications .This chapter begins with definitions of the common paranoid symptoms , expanding upon their descriptions in Chapter 1 , and then reviews the causes of such symptoms .Next comes a short account of paranoid personality .This is followed by discussion of primary psychiatric disorders with which paranoid symptoms are .Page 308 13 PARANOID SYMPTOMS AND DELUSIONAL DISORDERS .frequently associated , and the differentiation of these disorders from delusional disorders .The general features of delusional disorder , and its major subtypes are then reviewed .A historical perspective is also given , with particular reference to paranoia and paraphrenia .The chapter finishes with a summary of the assessment and treatment of patients with paranoid symptoms .Paranoid symptoms .It was pointed out above that the commonest paranoid delusions are persecutory .The term paranoid is also applied to the less common delusions of grandeur and jealousy , and sometimes to delusions concerning love , litigation , or religion .It may seem puzzling that such varied delusions should be grouped together .The reason is that the central abnormality implied by the term paranoid is a morbid distortion of beliefs or attitudes concerning relationships between oneself and other people .If someone believes falsely or on inadequate grounds that he is being victimized , or exalted , or deceived , or loved by a famous person , then in each case he is construing the relationship between himself and other people in a morbidly distorted way .The varieties of paranoid symptom were discussed in Chapter 1 , but important ones are also outlined in Box 13.1 for convenience .The definitions are derived from the glossary to the Present State Examination ( p. 63 ; Wing et al .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"82.132484"}

{"text":"Based on these previously recognized duties , the McIntosh court concluded that the psychiatrist had an affirmative duty to take reasonable precautions to protect potential victims of his patients .Id. at 490 , 403 A.2d at 512 .The Tarasoff and McIntosh decisions provide a well - reasoned framework for analyzing the issue of whether a psychotherapist owes an affirmative duty to persons other than his patient .This Court , however , must determine whether the Nebraska Supreme Court would adopt the Tarasoff - McIntosh analysis .\" The basis for the Tarasoff - McIntosh rule imposing an affirmative duty on psychotherapists was the courts ' adoption of the special relationship analysis of the Restatement ( Second ) of Torts Sec .This Court is not aware of any Nebraska case expressly adopting the rule found in the Restatement Sec .However , there are two Nebraska cases which implicitly recognize the special relationship analysis .See Daniels v. Anderson , supra , 195 Neb. at 98 , 237 N.W.2d at 400 , Rose v. Gisi , 139 Neb.593 , 597 - 598 , 298 N.W. 333 , 336 ( 1941 ) .The duty required that the defendant exercise reasonable care in controlling the action of a third person .In light of these Nebraska decisions recognizing an affirmative duty based on a special relationship , this Court is of the opinion that the Nebraska Supreme Court would adopt the special relationship analysis found in Restatement Sec .Although the Nebraska Supreme Court has never addressed this issue , this Court is of the opinion that the Nebraska court would find that the therapist - patient relationship gives rise to an affirmative duty for the benefit of third persons .\" The existence of this duty is suggested by a passage from a Nebraska case involving the physician - patient privilege .In Simonsen v. Swenson , 104 Neb. 224 , 177 N.W. 831 ( 1920 ) , the court held that a doctor was not liable to his patient for disclosing the patient 's confidence , when the disclosure was necessary to prevent the spread of a contagious disease .Simonsen v. Swenson , supra , 104 Neb. at 227 , 177 N.W. at 832 .From this passage , it may be inferred that under Nebraska law the physician - patient relationship imposes affirmative duties on the physician for the benefit of persons other than the patient .This inference is buttressed by the fact that other jurisdictions have found that a physician owes a duty to persons who may be harmed by their patient 's condition .Freese v. Lemmon , 210 N.W.2d 576 ( Iowa 1973 ) ; Kaiser v. Suburban Transportation System , 65 Wash.2d 461 , 398 P.2d 14 ( 1965 ) , modified [ 65 Wash.2d 461 ] 401 P.2d 350 ( 1965 ) .See Seibel v. City & County of Honolulu , supra , 602 P.2d at 538 .Despite this precedent imposing affirmative duties on physicians generally , the United States argues that various policy considerations counsel against the imposition of liability on psychotherapists .The primary thrust of the argument of the United States is that a therapist should not be held liable for the violent outbursts of his patients , because a therapist can not accurately predict which patients pose a danger to other persons .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"86.74402"}

'( Kraepelin 1904 , p. 199 ) .In later descriptions , Kraepelin ( 1919 ) used the distinction made by Jaspers ( 1913 ) between personality development and disease process .He proposed paranoia as an example of the former , in contrast to the disease process of dementia praecox .In his final account , Kraepelin ( 1919 ) developed these ideas by distinguishing between dementia praecox , paranoia , and a third paranoid psychosis , paraphrenia .He suggested that : . \"Dementia praecox had an early onset and a poor outcome ending in mental deterioration , and was fundamentally a disturbance of affect and volition .An important point was that the patients did not have hallucinations .The main difference from paranoia was that the patient with paraphrenia had hallucinations .Bleuler 's concept of the paranoid form of dementia praecox ( which he later called paranoid schizophrenia ) was broader than that of Kraepelin ( Bleuler 1906,1911 ) .Thus Bleuler did not regard paraphrenia as a separate condition , but as part of dementia praecox .However , he accepted Kraepelin 's view of paranoia as a separate entity , although he differed from Kraepelin in maintaining that hallucinations could occur in many cases .Bleuler was particularly interested in the psychological development of paranoia ; at the same time he left open the question of whether paranoia had a somatic pathology .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"87.001"}

Carens 's \" The Case for Amnesty : Time Erodes the State 's Right to Deport , \" published in The Boston Review .But the Sensenbrenner / Schumer reasoning utterly ignores this dimension in favor of abstract principles that have little to do with the realities of immigrants ' lives .The only imperative is to bend over backwards to satisfy the xenophobes that the state has not somehow granted \" amnesty to illegal aliens .\" The way the immigration legislation is shaping up , it would be a prime instance of the law causing more harm than good , as it goes out in search of policy monsters to destroy that do n't exist in the first place ( see here ) .In all the major dimensions of policy , the Obama administration has failed to follow up on its greatest publicized strength : the capacity to formulate consensus based on rational consideration of the facts .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"87.7641"}
{"text":"The results in this survey also reflected a greater cautiousness in accepting such patients for treatment , a trend toward seeking consultation with colleagues , and a heightened anxiety about being sued .Beck 's earlier survey , soon after Tarasoff , did not find the Tarasoff duty to be an onerous task to academic psychiatrists due to relative availability of colleagues with whom to discuss the cases and the plethora of available services and facilities in a university setting . n133 Typically , these academically based clinicians chose commitment when the threat of violence was considered imminent , and to warn the potential victim when violence was considered not imminent , unlikely , or was vague .Assessing the effect of Tarasoff and its progeny upon the practice of psychotherapy is difficult .The three major surveys , n134 two of which were done after Tarasoff II , n135 may be summarized as follows : .The Wise Survey , 1978 : .a. Prior to Tarasoff II , 50 % of therapists issued warnings ; after Tarasoff II , 38 % issued warnings .b. Therapists had increased sensitivity to probing for violence in their patients .c. A small minority of therapists rejected violent patients and discussion of violence for fear of liability .The Givelber Survey , 1980 : .a. Therapists aware of Tarasoff were more likely to warn potential victims .b. Seventy to eighty percent of therapists believed there was an ethical duty to protect even before Tarasoff .c. Therapists continued to treat violent patients .d. Therapists accepted the concept that societal safety was more important than confidentiality .e. Therapists often went beyond warning the potential victim to protect .The Rosenhan Survey , 1987 : .a. Eighty - five percent of therapists were aware of Tarasoff , but were confused about what was required by the law .b. Ninety percent of therapists had warned a potential victim .c. Almost all therapists believed their duty to warn was based on an ethical obligation , regardless of the law .d. Therapists were more cautious in treating violent patients .e. There was an increased trend among therapists toward seeking informal consultation with colleagues .f. There was heightened fear of litigation among therapists .Smaller studies suggest that therapy is not hindered by warranted breaches of confidentiality , so long as the patient is involved in the decision and/or appropriately informed .n136 There has been no evidence that patients have been unnecessarily hospitalized . n137 Nevertheless , the mechanisms recommended in protective statutes --- warning the victim and police --- are rarely utilized in favor of hospitalization .B. Confidentiality . n138Thus , 50 % were willing to breach confidentiality in the face of imminent violence to third parties even before Tarasoff .Also , well before Tarasoff , prominent psychiatrists , including Karl Menninger and Seymour Halleck , had expressed the belief that to reveal confidential information under circumstances where violence was imminent was neither a breach of trust nor unethical . n139 .CONCLUSION .Considering the current state of the law and ethical pronouncements regarding the expanded duty to society , while maintaining trust within the therapist - patient relationship , therapists today must reflect on how best to assess and document potential violence to third parties .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"87.92257"}

{"text":"Many health care professionals feel that confidentiality allows an intimate exchange of information facilitating appropriate care and a correct diagnosis .As part of their daily practice , physicians and healthcare providers \" examine and invade a patient 's physical and mental privacy \" ( 43 ) .Some medical problems are shameful to the patient and they fear the consequences of public response .Additionally , some third parties may find out information that they can use against the patient .For example , insurance companies can use HIV status against one who shows positive for the test .This can leave the patient without medical insurance or medical attention .To avoid this , the physician 's duty should form a protective shield against unwanted intrusion of others .In other words , the physician has certain duties to follow to protect the patient .However , informal breaches occur all the time between health care workers in the hospital .No matter where you are in the hospital ; halls , elevators , smoking areas , you can not help hearing information about a patient .No principle can be all encompassing .Breaching confidentiality has permissive circumstances , as long as certain rules are followed to avoid legal sanctions .Exceptions are made with regard to patient confidentiality to promote public health ( i.e. , to protect children and spouses from abuse or any other individual in danger ) and protect sensitive information .Furthermore , certain permissive circumstances exist when a patient has authorized the physician to disclose the medical record to a lawyer or insurance company .Along with proper authorization , there are also carefully - defined policies when releasing information without the consent of the patient .With this in mind , medical records should only be granted to those with a legitimate right .In fact , the healthcare provider owns the medical record but the patient owns the information within the record .This is where health care providers must be careful not to break confidentiality .Although patients have a limited right to access their medical record , the final decision is made by the health care provider .If the medical record contains information injurious to the health of the patient or if the information is expected to cause harm to any individual then the record is not accessible to the patient under such circumstances .One specific case that highlights an exception to protected patient confidentiality is the influential Tarasoff Case .On October 27 , 1969 , Prosenjit Poddar killed his ex - girlfriend , Tatiana Tarasoff .Two months earlier , Poddar had claimed his intentions during an outpatient therapy session with his psychotherapist , Dr. Lawrence Moore at the University at California at Berkeley 's Cowell Memorial Hospital .Dr. Moore made an attempt ( including the fact that he asked university police for assistance ) to have Poddar confined to a mental institution for observation .When law enforcement agents decided that Poddar was harmless and released him , Moore 's director , Dr. Harvey Powelson , requested that all evidence of contact between Moore and the police department be destroyed .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"88.55405"}

Parker , n72 a Virginia Supreme Court decision handed down in 1995 , the court found no \" special relationship \" between the psychiatrist and a patient who had voluntarily admitted himself to the hospital .Cases in Kansas , n73 Missouri , n74 Mississippi , n75 and North Carolina n76 similarly concluded that there is a more limited duty to protect against the actions of patients voluntarily admitted to the hospital .Some courts have required that the threat be clearly foreseeable .In the 1992 case of Leonard v. Iowa , n77 the court stepped away from the Lipari broadly foreseeable standard in stating that the duty extended only to \" reasonably foreseeable victims \" and not to the general public .More recently , courts have dismissed cases that revealed no evidence of an explicit threat .In Leonard v. Latrobe Area Hospital , n78 a 1993 Pennsylvania case , a psychiatrist was found not to have a duty to protect the spouse of his hospitalized patient if no specific threats were made during the hospitalization .In this case , a patient was admitted with an overdose and expressed a great deal of hostility .However , he did not specifically identify the spouse as the intended victim .Two months after discharge from the hospital , the patient shot and killed the spouse .The facts of the case also revealed that the family was well aware of the patient 's violent behavior .Not only has the effect of the Tarasoff decision been profound in the field of psychiatry , but it has influenced decisions in fields far removed from psychiatry .There has been a continuum of cases based on its precedent that have promulgated a broad duty for health care practitioners to protect the general public from foreseeable harm .These cases have clustered around two central issues --- the practitioner 's duty to protect the public from a patient who presents a danger while driving a motor vehicle and the practitioner 's failure to protect the public from a patient who may transmit an infectious disease .More recently , a third danger has appeared as a likely nidus for future cases --- the practitioner 's failure to protect the public from a patient who may transmit a genetically based disease .All three of these areas are worthy of discussion .

{"text":"The Washington Supreme Court considered Tarasoff the seminal case in answering the first question .Tarasoff established the duty based on the special relationship of psychiatrist - patient to protect third parties from the dangerous propensities of the patient .The court then adopted the foreseeability standard set forth in Lipari v. Sears , Roebuck & Co.n89 to hold that the psychiatrist had a duty to take reasonable precautions to protect anyone who might foreseeably be injured by Knox 's drug - related mental problems .The court answered the second question by quoting a Washington statute , which stated that information gained during involuntary commitment remains confidential , with certain specific exceptions .The psychiatrist was not allowed to communicate with the superior court or Knox 's probation officer .Nonetheless , the court viewed as proper the jury instruction regarding this prohibition and found that both parties were able to argue their theory on a level playing field .With reasoning not unlike that in the Tarasoff case , the court ruled that the psychiatrist was not immune from liability and upheld the verdict in favor of the plaintiff .Washington courts have addressed three subsequent driving cases in which plaintiffs have asserted Petersen protections : Metlow v. Spokane Alcoholic Rehabilitation Center n90 ; Cox v. Malcom n91 ; and Johnson v. State .n92 The defendant in Metlow was a participant in the state 's Driving While Intoxicated deferred prosecution program , receiving outpatient treatment at a private alcohol rehabilitation center .The Washington Court of Appeals was not persuaded that the rehabilitation center had either the duty or the control necessary to invoke the Petersen / Tarasoff standard .In Cox , the Washington Court of Appeals would not extend the duty to protect to the minor plaintiff 's grandfather who had served alcohol to the driver of a car in which the plaintiff was a passenger .Finally , in Johnson , the defendant was on parole , conditioned on his treatment for substance abuse .Through an error in communication , the defendant was released rather than sent directly to the drug rehabilitation center .One week later , the defendant struck and killed the plaintiff .The Washington Court of Appeals did not believe the evidence supported a finding that a special relationship existed upon which a duty could be predicated .Accordingly , the plaintiff 's case failed .Although the plaintiff introduced the Tarasoff theory of negligence in the Oregon case of Cain v. Rijken , n93 and the case is often listed as a Tarasoff -based driving case , n94 the Oregon Supreme Court specifically avoided citation to the case in its decision .In 1978 , Rijken was involved in a high - speed chase with the police through two Oregon counties , seriously damaging two cars when driving into oncoming lanes of traffic at 80 miles per hour .The trial court found Rijken was incompetent to stand trial and placed him in the custody of the Oregon Psychiatric Security Review Board ( Board ) .The Board committed Rijken to the Oregon State Hospital .By 1980 , Rijken was back in Portland enrolled as an outpatient at Providence Hospital .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"91.24007"}

{"text":"After the murder , Tatiana 's parents became aware of the prior knowledge and sued the university regents , hospital , and police department , claiming that , at least , a warning should have been issued .On July 1 , 1976 ( more than 6 1/2 years after the murder ) the Supreme Court of California found that the defendants had breached their duty to exercise reasonable care .In other words , physicians and therapists have a duty to warn third parties of threatened danger arising from a patient 's violent intentions .In establishing the decision , the majority opinion stated that the most important consideration in establishing duty to protect a third party is \" foreseeability \" .The majority opinion found that foreseeability was evident in this case because a definitive , well - thought - out plan existed .In fact , Poddar had even set forth a loose time frame ( \" when she gets home from Brazil \" ) for his actions .However , as a general rule , foreseeability is not enough .It was decided that some type of special relationship must have existed between the defendants in this case and either Poddar or Tarasoff .The majority opinion held that the relationship between a doctor or therapist and a patient is sufficient to establish this necessary link and may support clear obligation to a third person .Therefore , the doctor / patient relationship can actually be used to establish the link that allows the \" foreseeability rule \" to be applied .As a final statement , the court decided that , in short , \" protective privilege ends where public peril begins \" ( Mappes , 166 ) .In contrast , the dissenting opinion in the Tarasoff case provided further reasons for upholding confidentiality .The first argument presented in this opinion is that \" without the promise of complete confidentiality , people needing treatment may be deterred from seeking it \" ( Mappes , 166 ) .Furthermore , even those individuals that do seek treatment may be unwilling to fully disclose innermost thoughts .In order for a patient to overcome inhibitions and \" open up \" to a therapist , this opinion argued that the patient can not be burdened with the fear that these innermost feelings will be disclosed .A third issue raised in the dissenting opinion is that effective treatment requires trust between therapist and patient .Even if a patient is willing to seek treatment and fully disclose innermost thoughts , if complete trust , especially in the area of non - disclosure , does not exist , the effectiveness of the treatment may be sacrificed .According to this opinion , satisfactory therapy hinges upon the ability of the patient to trust the therapist absolutely .Based upon these arguments , the dissenting opinion expressed the belief that if the duty to warn was imposed upon psychotherapists , a net increase in violence would likely result ... that instead of protecting third parties , forced warnings would actually place these individuals at greater risk .As shown above , the subject and standards regarding the idea of confidentiality are complex and difficult to determine .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.4697"}

{"text":"However , the principle of confidentiality is not absolute ; ethical , legal and statutory obligations may permit physicians to disclose information .At a minimum , health care professionals should have an ethical duty to inform patients prior to testing , as well as upon receipt of results that the information obtained may have familial implications .It is important , though , to stress that the harm from failing to disclose should outweigh the harm of disclosure .Furthermore , there are four positions or opinions that health care professionals often take regarding their duty or privilege to warn at risk relatives .For example , the physician may feel that confidentiality is absolute and all medical information is strictly private ( that physicians have a duty to say nothing ) .The physician may also take the stand that the 1983 Presidential Commission for the study of Ethical Problems outlined , which explains the exceptional disclosure criteria mentioned above .The President 's Commission does stress that if these criteria are indeed met , a legal duty to warn is not implied .These are only guidelines in which it would be permissible to do so !Finally , the physician may prefer to have somewhat of a ' Miranda Warning , ' which would inform the patient before testing of circumstances that would result in the disclosure of genetic information to other family members .More recently , the lack of standardization for the ethical dilemmas of confidentiality has been proven in the 1995 Florida case of Pate v. Threkel and in the 1996 New Jersey case of Safer v. Estate of Pact .In the Threkel case , a daughter suffering form thyroid carcinoma sued her mother 's physician on the grounds that he knew that her mother 's previously diagnosed cancer was hereditary .She claimed that this knowledge gave rise to a duty to warn the mother that her children might be at risk and should be tested .The daughter felt that , had she been tested , she would have taken preventative measures to thwart the disease .The court noted that it was not the physician 's duty to warn and that to require him to do so would be difficult or impractical and would create too heavy a burden .In the Safer case , however , it was found that the physician had a duty to warn those relatives known to be at risk of avoidable harm , irrespective of potential conflicts between this duty to warn and the obligation of confidentiality .The appellate court , even while considering Pate , overruled the trial court 's desire for confidentiality within the doctor - patient relationship and held that there can be a duty to warn relatives .Again , as shown by these two cases , the legal and ethical dilemmas of confidentiality can be quite difficult .On a different note , when discussing the topic of HIV , the duty to warn has not been extended to the realm of infectious diseases .Professionals generally protect such sensitive information by guarding HIV status .In view of the deadly nature of the AIDS virus , however , legislation to extend the duty to clinicians treating patients with HIV has been raised ( in Massachusetts ) but not yet passed .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"95.2905"}

Bush was president .During the 2000s , they rallied against torture .But while Obama has banned torture , he has \" indefinitely detained \" Bradley Manning , personally overseen the killing of an American citizen in Yemen and escalated a drone war in Pakistan , terrorizing the locals there while fearing little political fallout at home .As Friedersdorf says : \" Obama soothes with rhetoric and kills people in secret . \"Jamelle Bouie , of The American Prospect , appreciates Friedersdorf 's frustration but demurs . \" For as much as they have a huge effect on the direction of the country , presidential elections are not the place where meaningful change occurs . \"","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.04643"}

Regents of the University of California , n103 that the California Court of Appeals directly applied Tarasoff to such a case .In April of 1985 , 12-year - old Jennifer Lawson underwent surgery at the UCLA Medical Center .During the surgery or immediately thereafter , Jennifer received transfusions of blood and blood products ( blood ) .The day following surgery , Jennifer 's physician , Dr. Fonklesrud , and UCLA Medical Center , were informed that the blood given to Jennifer was contaminated with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .Neither UCLA nor Dr. Fonklesrud told Jennifer or her parents about the HIV contamination or about the possibility of developing AIDS .Dr. Fonklesrud continued to treat Jennifer .About three years later , Jennifer began dating Daniel Reisner .A short time later , the couple began sexual relations .Almost five years after the surgery , Jennifer was diagnosed with AIDS and informed about the UCLA transfusion .Jennifer and her parents immediately informed Daniel and his parents .Daniel was immediately tested for HIV .Approximately one month later , Jennifer died and Daniel was informed that he was HIV positive .Daniel sued Dr. Fonklesrud and UCLA Medical Center for damages .The defendants conceded there was a duty to warn , but maintained that there was no duty to warn unidentifiable third parties .The defendants then moved for judgment on the pleadings ( summary judgment ) and the trial court granted the motion on the basis that no duty was owed to an unidentifiable third party .Daniel appealed from this judgment .The appeals court held that the duty to warn established in Tarasoff dictated the result in Reisner .The court supported Daniel 's claim that the defendants did not have to warn Daniel specifically but that they did have to warn Jennifer and her parents , who were likely to apprise him of the danger .The fact that Jennifer and her parents had done just that when they learned of the diagnosis did much to confirm Daniel 's contention .The Reisner court next addressed the defendant 's contention that , even if there were a duty to warn identifiable third parties , there was no duty to unidentified third parties .The court looked at the line of third - party liability cases and determined that third - party liability was not conditioned on the potential victims being readily identifiable as well as foreseeable .The court noted that Dr. Fonklesrud had continued to maintain a physician - patient relationship with Jennifer until she died , which occurred after Daniel 's injury .The court considered this continued relationship and the foreseeability of Jennifer 's likelihood of entering an intimate relationship as bases to negate the defendant 's efforts to avoid liability due to the time lapse between the negligent act and Daniel 's injury .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.38666"}

The Second California Supreme Court Decision .The plaintiffs asserted four causes of action in the 1976 case .The first cause of action was directed against the therapists ' failure to detain Poddar .The second cause of action was directed against the therapists ' failure to warn the Tarasoffs that Poddar presented a grave danger to Tanya .The third cause of action , directed against Dr. Powelson , sought punitive damages for his actions following the therapists ' attempt at 72-hour emergency detention .The fourth cause of action was titled \" Breach of Primary Duty to Patient and the Public \" and involved essentially the same allegations as the first cause of action .n51 The court also held that Dr. Powelson 's actions fell squarely within the granted immunity , n52 and further , California statutes barred the recovery of punitive damages in a wrongful death action .Thus , the outcome of the case hinged on the second cause of action , the therapists ' failure to warn Tanya or others likely to apprise her of her danger .In exploring this issue , the court proceeded in much the same manner as did Fleming and Maximov .The court started its analysis with a consideration of the therapist 's duty to third parties , and other than using Prosser n53 and the Restatement ( Second ) of Torts n54 to a greater extent than Fleming and Maximov , made the same general arguments .The court then took a short look at the difficulty in predicting dangerous behavior .n55 This observation provides minimal judicial notice of this principle , when compared to the decision in Burnick .Confidentiality , too , was given a more superficial treatment than was the case in the article by Fleming and Maximov .A public interest argument was made for the loss of privilege , but the due process considerations and the effect on psychotherapy are ignored on the face of the opinion , although reference is made to Fleming and Maximov and to Johnson , where the issues are discussed .The court sums up its conclusion on the matter of confidential communication with the following statement : \" The protective privilege ends where the public peril begins . \"n56 The court obviously liked the ring of this phrase because it is repeated in both decisions .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"96.529816"}

Goldwater and his wife , Hattie Josephine ( \" JoJo \" ) Williams .His father 's family had founded Goldwater 's , the largest department store in Phoenix .Goldwater 's paternal grandfather , Michel Goldwasser , a Polish Jew , was born in 1821 in Poland , from which he emigrated to London following the Revolutions of 1848 .Soon after arriving in London , he anglicized his name from \" Goldwasser \" to \" Goldwater \" .He married Barry 's grandmother , Sarah Nathan , a member of a Jewish English family , in the Great Synagogue of London .[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Goldwater 's mother , who was Protestant , came from a New England family that included the theologian , Roger Williams of Rhode Island .[ 9 ] Goldwater 's parents were married in an Episcopal church in Phoenix ; for his entire life , Goldwater was an Episcopalian , though on rare occasions he referred to himself as \" Jewish \" .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"106.09589"}

{"text":"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday dumped cold water all over the idea that Congress will be able to overhaul the nation 's immigration system sometime in 2014 .Senator Mitch McConnell , a Republican from Kentucky , speaks during a news conference after the weekly Republican Democratic Policy Committee meeting Tuesday , Dec. 4 , 2012 .Andrew Harrer / Bloomberg .\" The Senate insists on comprehensive and the House says it wo n't go to conference with the Senate on comprehensive and wants to look at it step - by - step , \" he told reporters .\" I do n't see how you get to an outcome this year with the two bodies in such a different place .\" As we 've written before , when McConnell talks it 's always worth listening ; he 's probably the most astute political strategist -- with the possible exceptions of Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer -- currently in the Senate .McConnell 's proclamation yesterday came after what seemed to be a series of indications that the prospects of an immigration deal were improving .House Speaker John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) has made it clear he wants congressional Republicans to begin making real headway on a deal .In December , Boehner hired Rebecca Tallent , a longtime aide to Sen. John McCain and an immigration expert .Then , last week , the House GOP unveiled a list of its immigration reform priorities , which included exploring an option to grant legal status to illegal immigrants who are currently in the country , but not necessarily a pathway to citizenship .President Obama , who would prefer a deal that includes a path to citizenship , then said he might be okay with that .These steps were seen as the biggest indication in years that House Republicans may be ready to compromise on immigration reform , and Boehner 's motive in shepherding the GOP to such efforts is clear .The GOP faces major problems come 2016 if they can not stymie the Democrats ' demographic advantages with Hispanics .Mitt Romney won just 27 percent of Hispanic voters in 2012 , and , by the time Obama 's second term is up , those voters are expected to represent an even more powerful chunk of the electorate .But working through a complex issue like immigration requires finding just the right sweet spot .Compromise too much -- by providing full amnesty to immigrants already living in the country illegally -- and the GOP would enrage the conservatives at the core of its base .Refuse to budge at all , and they risk passing a House bill that will never make it through the Senate and will do little to win over Hispanic voters .And , finding that sweet spot is made even harder by the fact that this is a midterm election year .Recent polling shows that Republican voters still lag behind the broader electorate when it comes to support for the exact types of reforms ( specifically , pathway to citizenship ) that would be included in an immigration deal .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"110.63267"}

{"text":"The Rio Grande Valley of Texas is a world apart , isolated by empty ranch land to the north , the Gulf to the east , and Mexico to the south .A million - and - a - half people live there amid dazzling wealth and stark poverty .Today , nearly two weeks after the catastrophic Memorial Day floods in Texas , search crews are still combing the banks of the Blanco River looking for three people who remain missing .They 've already found eight bodies .Meanwhile , residents of the tourist and retirement town of Wimberley , Texas , hit hardest by the flood , are cleaning up and struggling to reclaim their lives .Authorities in Waco , Texas , continue to investigate the deaths of nine motorcycle gang members in one of the worst biker brawls in recent times .More than 170 people were arrested and charged with organized crime ; each is being held under a $ 1 million bond .Now there 's a backlash from biker groups , who claim many of the riders were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time , and had nothing to do with Sunday 's bloody fight .A brawl among as many as five rival motorcycle gangs turned deadly on Sunday in Waco , Texas .Nine bikers were killed and 18 injured at a popular sports bar frequented by the gangs .No bystanders or employees were hurt .Waco police said trouble had been brewing at the Twin Peaks bar and grill for some time .Bikers had been congregating there in ever - increasing numbers , and there had been more and more arrests for fights and weapons .Authorities had intelligence that there was a high potential for violence on Sunday .And they were right .Last year , 21,000 inmates were released in Huntsville , Texas - one of the largest prison towns in America .For most of them , their gateway to the free world is the Huntsville Greyhound station .Monday through Friday , the glass doors swing open on the front of the Civil War - era , red - brick prison they call \" The Walls .\" The inmates exit and shuffle along the sidewalk , some smiling , some pensive , shouldering potato sacks full of belongings .Most of them do n't have loved ones waiting , so they continue walking the two blocks to the bus station - single file , out of habit .Matamoros , which sits across the bridge from Brownsville , Texas , used to be a laid - back border town famed for margaritas and manufacturing .But for at least the past five years , it 's grown more and more violent : first , when the Zetas broke away from the Gulf Cartel , and more recently as a new feud has broken out between two factions within the Gulf .The Willacy County Correctional Center is empty now .The tall security fences and dome - like housing units set out on the coastal prairie have no one inside them .One morning late last month , the prisoners rioted .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"125.1013"}
