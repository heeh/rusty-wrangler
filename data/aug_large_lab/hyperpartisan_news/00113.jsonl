Bush should be given a humanitarian award ?This former president and his advisers are directly responsible for the needless deaths of thousands of U.S. troops and tens of thousands of civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the wounding and displacement of millions of people .The continuing cost of these wars is an appalling legacy of extreme misjudgment in international relations .Add to this record the erosion of U.S. civil liberties , economic policies which took our country from a budget surplus to massive deficits , widespread mistreatment of prisoners of war , and a complete lack of remorse or accountability for his harmful actions .This letter was published online only .For information on how to send a letter to the editor , click here .Follow eLetters on Twitter to receive updates about new letters to the editor when they 're posted .I find it almost impossible to believe that someone with professor Lucy Marsh 's qualifications and seniority has been treated so shabbily .During my time at the University of Denver law school , I found that she was one of two or three professors there who actually taught me something .Most of the rest were egotistical stuffed shirts who could n't have cared less about whether they were teaching or we students were learning .They were mainly interested in law school games , i.e. , the Socratic method , or their public images .For the money I paid to go to DU , I should have been treated better , and Marsh should have had a far better salary .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"59.696796"}

S. Senator Kelly Ayotte ( see multiplicity of links below ) was arrested by the Nashua Police Department in a prostitution sting .Usually a local prostitution arrest would not trigger national implications .But the \" secondary explosions \" following the arrest of local powerhouse David Wihby do have national implications for the 2016 presidential primary and perhaps even for primaries after that one .Allow me to explain .( I will also be providing coverage in greater depth on this issue during the next few days as we approach a \" First in the Nation \" presidential candidate event April 18 - 18 in - where else ? -Nashua .( Hopefully no candidate will be caught by the NPD 's \" Prostitution Squad \" during the \" FITN \" event . )I worked in the U. S. Senate and have been a follower of the senate and national politics for half a century .One of the cardinal rules for U. S. Senators is that they should not intrude in local politics and party primaries because such local meddling can cost them support and ultimately reelection .Ayotte has been a decent senator , not excellent but decent , but her lack of prior elected political experience and her constant meddling in New Hampshire GOP internal politics and primaries could cost her reelection in 2016 .In 2014 , Ayotte supported Horn 's maneuver to import an out - of - state candidate , Scott Brown , for the U. S. Senate .The tactic backfired .Conservatives rebelled .In late 2014 Ayotte again backed Horn during an internal battle over who would become speaker of the state house of representatives after Republicans took control in Concord in 2014 .The majority of the caucus supported State representative Bill O'Brien but Horn and Ayotte backed his opponent .O'Brien was stabbed in the back when the supporters of Horn and Ayotte supported an anti - O'Brien candidate for speaker , and the Democrats ended up choosing the speaker for a Republican majority .Understandably , O'Brien is still rankled by what happened only a few months ago .Horn has been attacking me since 2011 and so I have no more love for her than Bill O'Brien does .Earlier this week O'Brien issued an attack on Ayotte for her poor choice of senior staff member in Wihby .End of story ?Not at all .Horn then attacked O'Brien for attacking Wihby and herein lies the crux of the conflict for 2016 and thereafter .Horn likes to talk about \" party unity . \"","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"86.463776"}

{"text":"And if they just so happen to get a laugh out of it , Murray would n't mind that either .4 Ways You Can Reach Out to Military Wives .In this interview with military wife and author Sara Horn , Grace Clausing shares some helpful tips for making a difference in the lives of military families .Think through what you can do as we celebrate our freedom this weekend !If it 's not your own family member serving in the military , chances are , you know someone who has been affected by the war in Iraq .It can be difficult to know just how to support those whose loved ones are serving , but military wife Sara Horn has some firsthand experience .Not only has her husband , Cliff , served in Iraq , but as the first denominational religion reporter to cover faith from the war zone for Baptist Press , Horn has an acute awareness of life on the front lines : . \" The thing that struck me hardest was that when you 're in the military , it does n't matter what denomination or church you ascribe to or belong to ; it 's whether you know Jesus or not , \" Horn says .So as you approach the admirable task of reaching out to military wives , let these 4 easy tips help you get started .Be a friend .For Horn , life as the spouse left behind was tough at times , especially when it came to hanging out with friends .\" When your husband is deployed , you suddenly find yourself alone , which can be hard because typically the friends you have are couple friends and you 're suddenly without your [ other ] half , \" says Horn .Finding other women to do things with can be challenging .According to Horn , \" The friends you do have are already busy with their husbands and families , so it 's hard to find time to do things together . \"Be specific .\" I was frequently told to let people know if there was anything they could do to help .I know people were being well - meaning , but I ca n't tell you how hard it was ! \" says Horn .She recommends calling the military wife and telling her a specific task you 'd like to do and asking when a good time would be to do it .It may be tough for the military wife to ask for help , so volunteering to do a particular chore allows her to feel like she 's not asking someone to do something they do n't necessarily want to do .Ask .Most wives want to talk about their husband , so do n't be afraid to ask about him .Horn encouraged their friends to email her husband , but she noticed that out of sight , out of mind often came into play .\" If you want to support a military spouse , be willing to support and do things for the deployed spouse , \" says Horn .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"105.160965"}
