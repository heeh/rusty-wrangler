{"text":"For this reason , I believe that Lincoln is and will probably always be , our greatest President .Jimmy Veith .To SKPeterson @ 45 .\" Why was the United States the only Western nation that had to fight a war to end slavery ? \" Good question .I can think of two reasons .First , the United States was the only Western Country where slavery was legal in one half of the country and illegal in the other half .The other Western nations had one rule of law that governed the entire country .For example , when it was outlawed in England , it was outlawed everywhere in England .Our federal system of states rights allowed slavery to exist in part of the country and not the other .As a result , the country evolved into two separate political and economic systems .The southern half of the country that had a climate to support plantations of cotton and tobacco became dependent on slave labor and developed an entire culture that was vastly different than the northern half of the country that was more dependent on manufacturing .( Although , much of the manufacturing was dependent on obtaining raw materials such as cotton that was grown in the South .So the North should share some blame for benefiting indirectly from slave labor . )The expansion of slavery to the western states was viewed as a threat to the balance of power that one region would have over the other .This would ultimately lead to civil war .Second , the other Western nations did not need to have slavery within their own boarders .Under the system of colonialism , they could reap the benefits of slavery ; ie , access to raw materials produced by slaves , such as cotton , tobacco , sugar , etc . ' , without having to see the cruelty of slavery first hand .Out of sight , out of mind .They could pretend to be morally superior while pursuing economic policies that promoted slavery off shore .If you suggest by your question that the civil war was a result of an aggressive federal government overstepping its bounds , and that slavery would have ended on its own if the federal government had properly recognized the rights of the states , then I strongly disagree .Slavery may have ended on its own in the mid 1900 's if it was not for the civil war , but as far as I 'm concerned , it did not end soon enough .The Southern states had no constitutional authority to succeed from the Union , and Lincoln was correct in defending the Union and adopting policies that eventually lead to the passage of the 13th amendment to the Constitution .For this reason , I believe that Lincoln is and will probably always be , our greatest President .Jimmy Veith .To Cincinnatus @ 46 .You stated : \" The question of slavery was decided years before the first shot was fired ; \" .Can you tell me then when the question of slavery was decided ?","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"44.77324"}

{"text":"Now the reason that slavery did n't continue , as stated on the link , is largely the non - development of large - landowner(plantation)based agrarian economy .So here we see an economic divergence , just as there is a rise in sectionalism during the late 1820 's , following the end of fervent nationalism inspired by the war of 1812 .At the same time there is great expansion into the west , both playing into the hands of sectionalist politicians and exasperating their differences .This battle of political influence becomes the central narrative of the period from the mid 1830 's through the 1850 's .I should add I have no paticular guilt about this as an American .As a member of a species who did cruel things like this across the world , I suppose I feel a level of shame and horror .Also , to be perfectly realistic , wars are never based on ideals .They 're based on economics , politics and power , and even the few examples to the contrary barely hold up to a hard look - over .People may think or be told that there are idealistic reasons for the war they are / were in , but it happens every time .( American Revolution - motivated by want of power over politics and economics among the rich - planting class , not idealism about liberty and freedom among the common people ) .Slavery acts as one facet of this struggle from the 1830's-50 's .The other equally important facets include issues like tarriffs , states ' rights and the economic dynamics as the North industrialized .To say the South did n't have a problem with its rights being trampled on is to fundamentally misunderstand the issue .Its not an issue of whether it was happening , but if they thought it was happening .If you feel threatened , it does n't matter if you actually are , you respond in the same way .You can say that the fear Lincoln would end slavery caused secession , but again this fits into the greater fears of Northern control over the South , held by both the majority white poor and the minority white , rich land and slave owning upper class .Slavery was an important part of their economic dynamics , one that they felt was wholly threatened by the North .Their fear of no more slave states is more about political influence than it is about the righteousness of slavery .It is equally about the set of other motives ( federal power etc ) .As many have pointed out above me , if you look at the primary source writings of the time , the vast majority of the north ( the \" moral majority \" ) was a product of the time , overtly racist and accepting of slavery .There was a vocal minority that opposed slavery , but while they certainly player more heavily into Lincoln 's administration then earlier ones , they were not the factor that the south was afraid of .People were n't fed up with slavery , they were strong unionist , distrustful of secessionists and southerners , a purely geo - cultural effect .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"50.400208"}

Bush and Abraham Lincoln .The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did : \" Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves ; and , under the rule of a just God , can not long retain it .\" It 's interesting that George W. Bush invoked Abraham Lincoln in his Second Inaugural Address today .Because just this morning I was thinking about Abraham Lincoln 's Second Inaugural Address .In 1865 , Lincoln addressed only half the nation , which was fighting a war against the other half .The purpose of the war was to free the slaves .( Despite what hate - America leftists say , the Civil War was about slavery . )Abraham Lincoln 's message was to stay the course because we were doing the right thing .Today our soldiers are in Iraq , and Bush , like Lincoln , is saying that we need to stay the course and continue to do the right thing .In both cases , the goal is to free people who otherwise would not be able to free themselves .People complain about the cost of the Iraqi occupation .Compared to the cost of the Civil War , which exacted a terrible price on our nation , the Iraqi war is comparatively inexpensive .But slavery was our fault , and as Abraham Lincoln explained in his Second Inaugural Address , we deserved the price we paid in the form of the Civil War on account of our moral guilt .On the other hand , the plight of peoples in the Middle East is not our fault ( although hate - America leftists think all of the world 's problems are our fault ) .If we have any blame , it 's because we have not been aggressive enough in pursuing military options to promote freedom ( the opposite of the pacifism preached by leftists ) .There is a less expensive way to remove anti - American dictators from power .We can replace them with pro - American puppet dictators .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"98.21466"}

Anthony Bewley , whose fate is discussed in the Reynolds work , his opinion of the Southern hospitality you brag about .Rev. Bewley solely was murdered because , after the schism in the Methodist Episcopal Church over support of slavery , he refused to affiliate with the southern , pro - slavery segment .He was tracked down by a posse ( there was a $ 1,000 reward on his head ) and , ultimately , lynched while in the custody of the posse .His corpse was removed from a shallow grave and desecrated .He was 56 years old and there is considerable doubt as to whether he was particularly anti - slavery much less involved in an abolitionist conspiracy .As for the alleged general acceptance of slavery as a good thing , do you generally do your research by watching \" Gone With the Wind ? \" The first documented religious - based remonstrance against slavery was the 1688 Germantown ( PA ) Quaker protest against slavery .Benjamin Franklin was president of the Pennsylvania anti - slavery society and , even before he wrote Common Sense and The Crisis , Tom Paine wrote and had published an anti - slavery petition .It came shortly after this exchange regarding the 20 year moratorium in the Constitution before Congress could take any action to restrict or ban the African slave trade , .He wished it to be known also that this part of the Constitution was a compliance with those States .If the change of language however should be objected to by the members from those States , he should not urge it .Col : MASON was not against using the term \" slaves \" but agst .naming N.
