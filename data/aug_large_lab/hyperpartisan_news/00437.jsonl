Sparks , an officer called in the license plate of a GMC Suburban to request a computerized check .The dispatcher mistyped the information given by the officer and informed him that the plate was registered to a 1983 Chevy CTX .The dispatcher subsequently informed the officer of the error and that the correct registration information revealed it had expired one month earlier .After receiving the information , the officer initiated a traffic stop .Upon questioning the driver , the officer located a stolen motorcycle plate , amphetamine , a loaded .45-caliber gun and a black ski mask .This information also led to the officer obtaining a search warrant for the vehicle , which revealed additional weapons and drugs .The driver filed a motion to suppress the evidence , arguing the traffic stop was based on the computerized check on the wrong license plate .However , the court found that the driver failed to point to any evidence that the officer lacked good faith .Moreover , even assuming the officer did not possess good faith , the court found that the dispatcher , once she revealed her error , told the officer the Suburban s correct license plate was expired by one month .This is probable cause to stop the vehicle .Even without the additional probable cause as in Sparks , if an officer acts in good faith , the evidence may not be suppressed .In Walraven , the dispatcher gave the officer conducting the traffic stop information on a different license plate ( she inverted the last two numbers of the license plate ) and gave him this information on three separate occasions in a 3.5 minute period .The Walraven court further found that because the officer was concentrating on the Cadillac , he did not hear the dispatcher incorrectly repeat the license plate information .Moreover , evidence that the officer was concentrating on the road was also presented .Randomly checking license plates also applies to vehicles that are stationary .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"77.9519"}

Walraven , an Albany County , Wyo . , deputy sheriff observed two men driving a 1983 brown Cadillac bearing a Tennessee license plate .The deputy routinely ran the license plates on out - of - state vehicles .After asking his dispatcher to do a computerized check on the Cadillac s vehicle registration , the deputy was informed that the plate number belonged to a 1988 Toyota .The deputy decided to stop the Cadillac on that information alone .After stopping the vehicle and engaging the occupants in a conversation relating to the purpose of the traffic stop , the deputy located a bag containing 2 kilos of cocaine .The deputy arrested both occupants .The owner of the vehicle ( who was the passenger at the time of the traffic stop ) appealed the district court s denial of his motion to suppress the evidence of the cocaine , alleging the deputy obtained the contraband in violation of the Fourth Amendment .Specifically , the owner challenged the constitutionality of the deputy s registration check of his vehicle .The appellate court s analysis of the deputy s method in establishing reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle was succinct .In short , it held that because license plates are in plain view , no privacy interest exists in the license plates .Incorrect Plate Information What if an officer runs a computer check of a license plate and mistypes or misstates one of the license plate characters ?","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"78.720924"}

{"text":"Such requirements are designed to facilitate the identification of vehicle owners and the investigation of accidents , thefts , traffic violations and other violations of law .Commonly , if not universally , the statutes imposing the requirements of registration or licensing also prescribe fees which must be paid to authorize state officials to issue the necessary documents and plates .The serviceman who has not registered his car and obtained license plates under the laws ' of ' his home State , whatever the reason , may be required by the host State to register and license the car under its laws .The proviso is to be read , at the least , as assuring that § 514 would not have the effect of permitting servicemen to escape the obligation of registering and licensing their motor vehicles .We conclude , however , that no such purpose is revealed in the section or its legislative history and that its intent is limited to the purpose of assuring registration .Since at least the 2 % tax here involved has been held not essential to that purpose as a matter of state law , we affirm the California Supreme Court 's judgment .It is plain at the outset that California may collect the 2 % tax only if it is a ' license , fee , or excise ' on a motor vehicle or its use .The very purpose of § 514 in broadly freeing the nonresident serviceman from the obligation to pay property and income taxes was to relieve him of the burden of supporting the governments of the States where he was present solely in compliance with military orders .The statute operates whether or not the home State imposes or assesses such taxes against him .As we said in Dameron v. Brodhead , 345 U.S. 322 , 326 , 73 S.Ct .721 , 724 , 97 L.Ed .It saved the sole right of taxation to the state of original residence whether or not that state exercised the right .

'But in deciding that question in the absence of affirmative indication of congressional meaning , we must consider the overall purpose of § 514 as well as the words of subsection ( 2)(b ) .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"79.30046"}

{"text":"The conclusion that Congress lacked information about the California practice does not preclude a determination that it meant to include such taxes , levied only for revenue , as \" licenses , fees , or excises .\" But in deciding that question in the absence of affirmative indication of congressional meaning , we must consider the overall purpose of 514 as well as the words of subsection ( 2 ) ( b ) .Taxes like the California 2 % \" license fee \" serve primarily a revenue interest , narrower in purpose but no different in kind from taxes raised to defray the general expenses of government .9 It is from the burden of taxes serving such ends that nonresident servicemen were to be freed , in the main , without regard to whether their home States imposed or sought to collect such taxes from them .Dameron v. Brodhead , supra .In recent amendments , Congress has reconfirmed this basic purpose .10 We do not think that subsection ( 2 ) ( b ) should be read as impinging upon it .Whether the 2 % tax is within the reach of the federal immunity is thus not to be tested , as California argues , by whether its inclusion frustrates the administration of California 's tax policies .The test , rather , is whether the inclusion would deny the State power to [ 382 U.S. 386 , 396 ] enforce the nonrevenue provisions of state motor vehicle legislation .Whatever may be the case under the registration and licensing statutes of other States , California authorities have made it clear that the California 2 % tax is not imposed as a tax essential to the registration and licensing of the serviceman 's motor vehicle .Buzard v. Justice Court , 198 Cal .App .2d 814 , 817 , 18 Cal .Rptr .12 The California Supreme Court also held , in effect , that invalidity of the \" license fee \" as applied was a valid defense to prosecution under Vehicle Code 4000 .In these circumstances , and since the record is reasonably to be read as showing that Captain Buzard would have registered his Oldsmobile but for the demand for payment of the 2 % tax , the California Supreme Court 's reversal of his conviction is .Affirmed .Footnotes .[ Footnote 1 ] 50 U.S.C.

{"text":"Although restitution is usually difficult to obtain , it is essential that court orders be pursued vigorously because it is very important to a victim 's financial and psychological recovery .One of the issues involved in obtaining an adequate restitution award is the preparation of a comprehensive and hard - hitting victim impact statement .Detailed accounts of funds stolen in these crimes and documentation of emotional distress are imperative to achieving adequate awards .This is often made difficult because of the large volume of victims involved in financial crime schemes , and the fact that some victims experience difficulty with trust in divulging personal information , even to officials of the criminal justice system .Victim advocates should ensure that victims of financial crimes are provided information about how to complete victim impact and loss information as well as information about the date and time of sentencing .If possible , advocates should offer to assist at trials and sentencings in cases such as elder financial abuse , or other cases in which a prosecutor feels that a victim needs special consideration .The Need for Collaborative Efforts .With the enhancement of VOCA funding to allow services to financial crime victims , victim service professionals will soon have more options for referrals and community collaborative efforts to assist victims of financial crimes .Until that time , advocates need to look within their own communities to address the specific needs and concerns of financial crime victims .As stated in Providing Services to Victims of Fraud : Resources for Victim / Witness Coordinators ( Alexander 1998 ) : .In general , victim / witness coordinators are severely burdened with growing caseloads , a lack of program or administrative staff , and numerous job - related duties .Such constraints leave victim / witness coordinators little time to establish programs and services to meet the growing needs of fraud victims .Cases involving fraud make victim / witness coordinators ' jobs even more difficult , especially when those cases involve thousands of victims .Victim / witness coordinators can employ several effective strategies to enhance their services to fraud victims .Coordinators can network with members of the community and allied professionals to learn of appropriate referrals , and they can establish local or regional task forces to address voices in victim assistance programs and services .Efforts that can identify opportunities for collaboration within the community include : .Obtaining information about the types of financial crimes being reported to federal agents and/or local law enforcement within a community .Victim services providers can talk to local police who investigate crimes such as fraud , identity theft , or financial elder abuse and invite them to address local victim service meetings .Examining state or federal victims ' rights laws to compare those rights provided to victims of violent crimes to those afforded to victims of financial crimes .Where there is a difference , or financial crime victims are ignored , advocates should raise this issue for change by state - wide coalitions .( For example , under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ( 32 ) , victims of violent crimes are permitted to speak about the impact of a crime at sentencing , but the Rule is silent about financial crime victims also having this right . )","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"84.79987"}

{"text":"Investigators are often the only criminal justice personnel that victims of financial crimes may come into contact with , so it is important that such investigators be trained in effective and sensitive victim intervention .An article \" Investing in the Future : Protecting the Elderly from Financial Abuse , \" reported that because financial abuse is often not reported , and often not understood or recognized by law enforcement , such crimes often go undetected .The article includes a survey of financial institutions in which 83 percent of the respondents believed that some of their elderly clients were victims of financial abuse ( Coker and Little 1997 ) .The authors suggested several strategies : .Develop collaboratives in which law enforcement shares information with adult protective services , financial institutions , public guardians , and prosecutors both at the state and federal levels .In other types of financial crimes , law enforcement should be sensitive to the immediate financial and psychological needs of victims as a result of the impact of such crimes , and in some cases , susceptibility to future scams as a way of recouping what has been stolen .It is important for victim advocates to help law enforcement find appropriate referrals to provide to such victims .IMPORTANCE OF VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS AND RESTITUTION .Restitution is one of the primary factors affecting the satisfaction of victims within the criminal justice system ( OVC 1998 ) .It is essential that prosecutors , probation officers , victims , victim service professionals , and the judiciary all work together to secure the right to restitution for victims of financial crime .As discussed earlier in this chapter , significant legislative progress has been made in securing this right on both the federal and the state levels .However , there are exceptions to the ordering of restitution , as described above , and the existence of appropriate laws does not always translate into actual enforcement of their provisions .The following are others issues that may prevent victims from receiving restitution : .Judgments not listing the victim 's name and loss , thus making it unenforceable as an order , or for other purposes in which a victim may need his or her name listed on a judgment .Prosecutors may not feel that it is necessary to include all victims , feeling that victims have the option of civil recovery for their losses .However , by the time a case has been fully investigated and accepted by the prosecution , several years may have gone by , and civil recovery may be precluded because the applicable statute of limitation has expired .Even more crucial , most victims have losses that make it difficult to hire an attorney , especially if a defendant appears to have few assets .The underlying individual victim , who may have incurred many costs in trying to clear damaged credit records or restore bank accounts , may not be seen as a victim entitled to restitution .In cases of elder financial abuse or exploitation and in many investment and telemarketing cases , the elderly victim may not live long enough to see any restitution even whereordered .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"85.14424"}

{"text":"I have been fiddling with one ( I seem to be moving slowly these days ) but another voice - \" Leonidas Musashi \" - has entered the debate at The Bridge with a sharp retort against Allen 's conception of R2P : . ....My main observation , however , is that the discussion thus far has been focused more on a \" right \" to protect than a \" responsibility \" to do so .The arguments indicate that a state has a responsibility to protect its people but takes for granted that third parties somehow inherit this responsibility when the state can not fulfill it .There is a missing explanation here .The need to justify such efforts may seem callous , but a nation 's highest moral order is to serve its own citizens first .Such an explanation would certainly be a legitimate demand for a mother that loses a son who volunteered to defend his nation , or for a government entrusted by its people to use their resources to their own benefit .While it is often stated that the international community \" should \" intervene , explanation of where this imperative comes from is not addressed other than by vague references to modern states being interconnected .But this implies , as previously stated , a right based on the self - interest of states , firmly grounded in realistic security concerns , rather than any inherent humanitarian responsibility to intervene .Instability and potential spillover may very well make it within a nation 's vital interests to intervene in another country and pursuing humanitarian and human rights goals within the borders of another state may well be in a nation 's secondary interests .But if this is the case , the calculus of the political leadership will determine if pursuing this goal is worth the cost / potential costs - as has been done in such cases as North Korea , Iran , Zimbabwe , Tibet and Syria .In either case , the decision is determined by what is in the nation 's interests , a reality that makes R2P not a mandate , but a merely a post hoc justification for interventions that do occur .In short , with great responsibilities come greater costs .In part II .I will lay out a more methodical case on the intellectual phantom that is R2P .Often on weekends my wife allows me to tag along as she takes in area estate sales .She 's interested in vintage furniture , and I hope for a decent collection of books .A sale we visited a couple months ago had very few books , but of those few was a hardback copy of American Caesar .I purchased the copy for $ 1 and mentioned to my wife , \" I 'll get to this again someday ... \" as I 'd first read Manchester 's classic biography of General Douglas MacArthur in the early 1980 's while stationed on my first submarine . \"Someday \" started on the car ride home ( she was driving ) , and I must admit : American Caesar was even better thirty years later .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"85.91203"}

Henry Kutz filed a memorandum for the United States , as amicus curiae , urging reversal .MR .JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court .Section 514 of the Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Civil Relief Act of 1940 , 56 Stat .777 , as amended , provides a nonresident serviceman present in a State in compliance with military orders with a broad immunity from that State 's personal property and income taxation .Section 514 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the Act further provides that .The respondent here , Captain Lyman E. Buzard , was a resident and domiciliary of the State of Washington stationed at Castle Air Force Base in California .He had purchased an Oldsmobile while on temporary duty in Alabama , and had obtained Alabama license plates for it by registering it there .When he sought to do so , it was insisted that he pay both the registration fee of $ 8 imposed by California 's Vehicle Code 2 and the considerably larger \" license fee \" imposed by its Revenue and Taxation code .The conviction , affirmed by the District Court of Appeal , 38 Cal .Rptr .63 , was reversed by the Supreme Court of California , 61 Cal .2d 833 , 395 P.2d 593 .We granted certiorari , 380 U.S. 931 , to consider whether 514 barred California from exacting the 2 % tax as a condition of registering and licensing Captain Buzard 's car .We conclude that it did , and affirm .The California Supreme Court 's reversal of Captain Buzard 's conviction depended on its reading of the [ 382 U.S. 386 , 390 ] words \" required by \" in the proviso of 514 ( 2 ) ( b ) .The mandatory registration statute of Washington , as of most States , imposes the duty to register only as to cars driven on its highways , and Captain Buzard had not driven his car in Washington during the registration year .The court reasoned that there was thus no \" license , fee , or excise \" owing to and assessed by his home State .Since there was on this view no tax \" required by \" Washington , the court concluded that California could not impose its tax , even though Captain Buzard had not paid any Washington tax .If this reading of the phrase \" required by \" in the proviso were correct , no host State could impose any tax on the licensing or registration of a serviceman 's motor vehicle unless he had not paid taxes actually owing to and assessed by his home State .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"87.834335"}

{"text":"In the most common sense of the word , \" sovereignty \" is autonomy , freedom from external control .The sovereignty of any government usually extends up to , but not beyond , the borders of its jurisdiction .This jurisdiction defines a specific territorial boundary which separates the \" external \" from the \" internal \" , the \" within \" from the \" without \" .It may also define a specific function , or set of functions , which a government may lawfully perform within a particular territorial boundary .Black 's Law Dictionary , Sixth Edition , defines sovereignty to mean : ... [ T]he international independence of a state , combined with the right and power of regulating its internal affairs without foreign dictation .On a similar theme , Black 's defines \" sovereign states \" to be those which are not under the control of any foreign power : No foreign power or law can have control except by convention .This power of independent action in external and internal relations constitutes complete sovereignty .It is a well established principle of law that the 50 States are \" foreign \" with respect to each other , just as the federal zone is \" foreign \" with respect to each of them .See In re Merriam 's Estate , 36 NE 505 ( 1894 ) .The status of being foreign is the same as \" belonging to \" or being \" attached to \" another state or another jurisdiction .The proper legal distinction between the terms \" foreign \" and \" domestic \" is best seen in Black 's definitions of foreign and domestic corporations , as follows : Foreign corporation .A corporation doing business in one state though chartered or incorporated in another state is a foreign corporation as to the first state , and , as such , is required to consent to certain conditions and restrictions in order to do business in such first state .Domestic corporation .When a corporation is organized and chartered in a particular state , it is considered a domestic corporation of that state .The federal zone is an area over which Congress exercises exclusive legislative jurisdiction .It is the area over which the federal government exercises its sovereignty .Despite its obvious importance , the subject of federal jurisdiction had been almost entirely ignored outside the courts until the year 1954 .In that year , a detailed study of federal jurisdiction was undertaken .The occasion for the study arose from a school playground , of all places .The children of federal employees residing on the grounds of a Veterans ' Administration hospital were not allowed to attend public schools in the town where the hospital was located .An administrative decision against the children was affirmed by local courts , and finally affirmed by Page 11 - 1 of 20 .The Federal Zone : the State supreme court .The residents of the area on which the hospital was located were not \" residents \" of the State , since \" exclusive legislative jurisdiction \" over this area had been ceded by the State to the federal government .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"92.70792"}

{"text":"While the philosophies and conspiracy theories can vary from person to person , their core beliefs are the same : The government operates outside of its jurisdiction .Because of this belief , they do not recognize federal , state , or local laws , policies , or regulations .One prevalent sovereign - citizen theory is the Redemption Theory , which claims the U.S. government went bankrupt when it abandoned the gold standard basis for currency in 1933 and began using citizens as collateral in trade agreements with foreign governments .( 2 ) These beliefs can provide a gateway to illegal activity because such individuals believe the U.S. government does not act in the best interests of the American people .By announcing themselves as sovereign citizens , they are emancipated from the responsibilities of being a U.S. citizen , including paying taxes , possessing a state driver 's license , or obeying the law .Illegal Activity .The Redemption Theory belief leads to their most prevalent method to defraud banks , credit institutions , and the U.S. government : the Redemption Scheme .Sovereign citizens believe that when the U.S. government removed itself from the gold standard , it rendered U.S. currency as a valueless credit note , exchanging one credit document ( such as a dollar bill ) for another .They assert that the U.S. government now uses citizens as collateral , issuing social security numbers and birth certificates to register people in trade agreements with other countries .Each citizen has a monetary net worth , which they believe is kept in a U.S. Treasury Direct account , valued from $ 630,000 to more than $ 3 million .These accounts , they claim , are in a third - party 's name , a \" strawman , \" that they can access , which they commonly refer to as \" freeing money from the strawman .\" In essence , it is extorting money from the U.S. Treasury Department .Sovereign citizens file legitimate IRS and Uniform Commercial Code forms for illegitimate purposes , believing that doing so correctly will compel the U.S. Treasury to fulfill its debts , such as credit card debts , taxes , and mortgages .( 3 ) [ ILLUSTRATION OMITTED ] .At a minimum , these activities create a voluminous influx of documents that clog the courts and other government agencies .But , the idea behind the Redemption Theory also leads sovereign citizens to find criminal sources of income as they travel the country , teach fraudulent tactics to others for a fee , and participate in white collar crimes .The latter offenses include mail , bank , mortgage , and wire fraud ; money laundering ; tax violations ; and illegal firearms sales and purchases .At seminars , sovereign citizens charge participants a fee in exchange for information on Redemption Theory schemes and other methods to avoid paying taxes , sometimes even selling materials , such as CDs or DVDs .Several recent incidents highlight their activities .The men sold \" lifetime memberships \" to customers and promised to pay any accident claims against members .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"93.143875"}
