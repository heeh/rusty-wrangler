Bush and advisor to Sarah Palin .In addition , he is closely affiliated with ultra - conservatives like the Koch brothers and Breitbart News .However , there is another highly motivated player in this well - coordinated attack campaign that is getting less attention .Rupert Murdoch , chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox , commands a vast empire of media businesses that share a determined leaning toward activist , far - right politics .So it is not surprising that a committed conservative like Schweizer would integrate himself into the Murdoch machine .As a result , the opportunities for propaganda and profit become plentiful .Schweizer 's book was published by HarperCollins , which is owned by Murdoch 's News Corp.So making the book a bestseller puts cash directly into Murdoch 's wallet .To that end , Murdoch has exploited his own Fox News which has gone into overdrive promoting the book .Schweizer has become an almost daily fixture on the network , and when he is n't there himself , the network hands those promotional duties to their anchors and guests .All told , Fox News has donated the equivalent of more than $ 107 million to the marketing of the book , according to an analysis by Media Matters .And speaking Fox News , the network produced and aired its own hour - long special ( The Tangled Clinton Web ) that served as an unabashed infomercial for the book .And rather than assigning a political personality like Sean Hannity to the brazenly partisan project , it was hosted by Fox 's chief news anchor , Bret Baier .The program was repeated several times .So while running PR for the book , Fox News is also chasing ratings and advertising dollars from the book 's rollout .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"56.04291"}

{"text":"Now , in addition to supporting gun rights for people on the Terrorist Watch List , news reports have revealed that the NRA has been lying on their tax returns for years .Their filings have asserted ridiculously false claims such as that they do not receive membership dues or engage in political activity .And that 's not all : . \" For seven years , the NRA also skipped a key question on its tax form - whether or not it engaged in lobbying .Asked to answer ' yes ' or ' no , ' it simply left the space blank .[ ... ]Asked to detail expenses on its tax form , the NRA told the IRS it spent nothing on lobbying each year from 2008 to 2013 .In 2014 , it finally recorded $ 1 million in lobbying expenses .But even that figure is at odds with the amount reported to Congress of $ 3.4 million , according to data on the OpenSecrets Web site .It also recorded spending $ 23 million on unspecified ' legislative programs . 'Those are some pretty significant discrepancies that can not plausibly be explained away as inadvertent .The NRA is , at its core , a political lobbying organization that receives millions of dollars in membership dues .It would be like Pepsi accidentally failing to report any income from selling beverages .Most of the NRA 's funding comes from firearms manufacturers and dealers seeking to expand their businesses .Lobbying on their behalf is why the NRA exists .In a just world the NRA and its executives should be indicted for tax fraud and punished accordingly if found guilty .However , according to the NYPost , the New York Attorney General 's office would not comment on whether there is an investigation in progress .That often means that there is n't , but they are rushing to put one together to avoid being embarrassed by the disclosures in the press .Time will tell .In the meantime the NRA has been exposed as a dishonest enterprise that is not only making the nation a more dangerous place to live , but rips off the American people while doing it .An article posted on Fox Nation bore the headline \" No , Donald Is n't Deluded .\" It was referring to Trump 's assertion that he saw \" thousands and thousands \" of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center towers on 9/11 .There has never been any evidence of that happening .There are no photographs , no video , no police reports , nothing .In other words , Trump is either very much deluded , or lying through his dentures .It is , of course , ridiculous to believe that thousands of people could assemble in a major city for any purpose and leave no trace of it ever having taken place .Nevertheless , Trump has steadfastly clung to the obvious falsehood .And he 's had help from Fox News , who has been there to defend the indefensible many times in the past .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"93.8137"}

TYPES OF ELECTION CRIMES .Election Fraud .Election fraud usually involves corruption of one of three processes : the obtaining and marking of ballots , the counting and certification of election results , or the registration of voters .C. FEDERAL JURISDICTION .The federal government asserts jurisdiction over an election offense to ensure that basic rights of United States citizenship , and a fundamental process of representative democracy , remain uncorrupted .Election crime cases tend to be long - term prosecutive projects focusing on individuals with different degrees of culpability .The ultimate goal is to move up the ladder of culpability to candidates , political operatives , public officials , and others who attempted to corrupt , or did corrupt , the public office involved .Federal jurisdiction over election fraud is easily established in elections when a federal candidate is on the ballot .The mere listing of a federal candidate 's name on a ballot is sufficient under most of the federal statutes used to prosecute voter fraud to satisfy federal jurisdiction .This generally occurs in what are called \" mixed \" elections , when federal and nonfederal candidates are running simultaneously .In short , the absence of a federal candidate from the ballot can present federal law enforcement with special challenges in attaining federal jurisdiction over election crime .Those challenges can sometimes be met , provided the investigation focuses on identifying additional facts that are needed to invoke application of the federal criminal laws that potentially apply to both federal and nonfederal elections .These generally include election frauds that involve the necessary participation of public officers , notably election officials acting \" under color of law , \" voting by noncitizens , and fraudulently registering voters .If McDaniel insists on a Federal criminal investigation for a United States Senate election Holder 's Justice Department is obligated to investigate .BUT we all know Holder has n't been too keen on enforcing the law pertaining to corruption and on matters of the Republican Party unless perhaps he sees an opportunity to embarrass Republicans .Here is the email alert I received from the Tea Party Leadership Fund today posted below .In full disclosure and as is usual the case in an email alert there is an element of fund raising involved .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"104.74249"}
