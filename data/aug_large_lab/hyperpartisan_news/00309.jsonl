{"text":"And although 2012 delivered little good news for Canadian oil and gas producers , there is at least some hope that political considerations will force policy - makers to make real progress on the approval of new pipelines .On Thursday , Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall , along with 10 U.S. governors , inked a letter to President Barack Obama , urging him to \" move forward on the Keystone XL Pipeline project . \"\" The energy relationship between the United States and Canada is vital to the future of both our countries , \" reads the letter .\" It is an interest we share , transcending political lines and geographic boundaries .\" The benefit for Mr. Wall , according to a government press release , is that the pipeline would \" move growing American conventional oil production from the Bakken Formation to market , thus easing pipeline capacity for all jurisdictions that share this dynamic oil play , including Saskatchewan .\" It also makes political and economic sense for the United States .Exports to the United States are expected to reach four million barrels of oil per day ( b / d ) by 2020 , which would significantly reduce America 's reliance on oil from undemocratic , and often unfriendly , countries in the Middle East and South America .Keystone XL would also create thousands of much - needed jobs on both sides of the border .Keep in mind , Canada is expected to double its production from three million to 6.2 million b / d by 2030 , and Keystone XL will only add 500,000 b / d in new capacity .At the same time , China and other Asian countries continue to develop at a rapid pace , making it imperative that oil sands producers find a way to bring their product to this emerging market .The best and safest way to transport bitumen to the Pacific is to increase the capacity of the existing Trans Mountain Pipeline and to follow through on Enbridge 's proposed Northern Gateway pipeline .Building a new line to the West Coast , however , has seen significant opposition from environmentalists , First Nations and politicians .The ferocity of the opposition was on display this week during ongoing hearings in B.C. .Five protesters were charged with assault and trespass after disrupting a hearing in Vancouver on Tuesday .A protest organizer told the CBC that the process \" is becoming increasingly less democratic , \" even though many of the people speaking at the hearings oppose any new pipelines .Environmentalists - who are largely determined to halt oil sands production at any cost - have co - oped the process .Of course there are also political roadblocks that need to be overcome before any shovels can hit the ground : Namely , Ms. Clark 's demand that B.C. receive its \" fair share \" of the profits from the new line .However , fear that Adrian Dix , who is opposed to the new pipeline , and the NDP could displace the Liberals in the May 14 provincial election has given Ms. Clark some unlikely allies .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"114.53946"}
