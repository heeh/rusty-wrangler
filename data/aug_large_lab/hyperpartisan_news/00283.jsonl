{"text":"When Weinstein is unhappy , he does n't hide his emotions ; as a result , the Miramax staff suffers from something akin to battered - spouse syndrome .He will hear you .\" Staff members at Miramax often rise through the ranks and are encouraged to speak their minds and shout back ; many think of themselves as part of a family .But it is a decidedly patriarchal family .Weinstein was spending more time with Tina Brown and Talk , which had yet to generate much talk .This created strains among the Miramax staff , who often found themselves waiting for meetings while Weinstein was distracted by the magazine .There was also evidence of business friction between Bob and Harvey .Although the brothers insist that the shift was unrelated to Harvey 's outside activities , in 2001 Bob moved his office to another floor .He began to concentrate more on Dimension Films , which generated sixty - five per cent of Miramax 's profits that year .Bob told Time last spring that for the past six years Dimension had been the major breadwinner , adding , \" I 'm very focussed on the movie business , \" and implying that his brother was not .Often , staff members noticed Bob rolling his eyes at a Harvey project , though he never spoke badly of his brother .Bob challenged Harvey 's decision to cooeperate on this story .At a test screening of \" Confessions of a Dangerous Mind , \" in Edgewater , New Jersey , Bob looked at his brother and at me , and said , \" This is crazy ! , \" before walking away .( \" Confessions , \" directed by George Clooney , is based on a book by the game - show creator Chuck Barris . )Although I made regular requests to Bob Weinstein through his brother and through his spokesman , it took about three months to arrange an interview -- and he finally agreed because I 'd asked about the company 's finances .When the hour arrived , Bob said that he would talk only off the record and only about Miramax 's business .When I objected to these ground rules , he threatened to leave ; Harvey was called in , and eventually persuaded Bob to chat .After twenty minutes or so , I asked about Max Weinstein .Bob erupted , screaming at Harvey for talking to me about their father , and insisting that Harvey knew he was writing an essay of his own about Max Weinstein .He calmed down , politely apologized , and left .Weeks later , Bob -- who Harvey said had submitted his essay to Vanity Fair , where it will be published -- was still yelling at his brother for betraying him , and Harvey was pleading with me to avoid mentioning their father .No one believes that the brothers are going their separate ways .Not a chance , according to Michael Eisner .\" They are extremely loyal to each other , \" Eisner told me .\" They may fight , but if someone comes in between they close ranks .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"73.0581"}
{"text":"It 's unfortunate that he feels the need to publicly tear down Harvey whose history of a bad temper makes him an easy target .In script meetings , Harvey always wanted the heroes to have flaws .As a public figure and more importantly as a father , he realizes how important the example he sets is .I want to thank Mark , though , for bringing to everyone 's attention the correlation between BULLY and Harvey .Although his points are not at all true nor deserved by Harvey , he opened the door to give me this chance to speak on behalf of all of the Weinstein 's longtime employees about one of Harvey 's many intentions with the film BULLY .When Harvey took on BULLY , he told the filmmakers and the children about his own bad temper and history of taking it out on other people -- he even opened his argument to the MPAA with this fact .He told the filmmakers that while his main intention with the film is to produce an unprecedented amount of progress and forward thinking on what 's become a social crisis for children everywhere , he feels BULLY is a step towards his own redemption .He 's made a valiant effort for a significant amount of change in himself over the last 10 to 15 years .He looks at this film as one of the great causes of his life and hopes it will have the same effect on the audience .I hardly see Mark 's point in feeling the need to put this unnecessary negativity out in such a public way about a man who 's known for raising millions for the Robin Hood Foundation , AMFAR , 9/11 victims , schools , libraries , the list goes on .Aside from charitable work , he has a huge heart and values family more than anything .I personally have been the beneficiary at times of his generous counsel and support - something he provides to those in need more than anyone knows .In script meetings , Harvey always said he liked heroes that are n't too good , he liked flawed heroes .Well , Harvey is certainly flawed , but he is also a hero .Mark , we hope you read this and would love to hear about all of the positive things you have been doing to better those around you and charities you are involved in .As Harvey says : stop criticizing , start doing .Utah families grapple with rare disease , hope for progress .Glycogen storage disease , a rare , life - threatening illness that is more common in Utah than any other state .\" You would n't know that his life hangs in the balance every four hours . \" Bethany Cruz .\" Unfortunately , there 's still many children in this country who are not making it because of the lack of knowledge about GSD , \" Weinstein said .Cruz said she encourages parents to trust their instincts and pay attention to the symptoms - delayed growth , enlarged bellies , and restless sleep - to prevent a late diagnosis . \"","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"73.25612"}

{"text":"In fact , the only \" side effect \" I 've experienced while using PrEP is frustration over the anti - PrEP propaganda efforts of Michael Weinstein and his AIDS Healthcare Foundation .I 've read a great deal of the material issued by Mr. Weinstein , and I recently participated with him in a public forum on the use of PrEP , along with several committed advocates of HIV prevention .Where experts presented factual data regarding PrEP , Mr. Weinstein attempted to inspire fear of PrEP , and advocate against the makers of Truvada .Mr. Weinstein 's fear - mongering should come as no surprise , given that he previously attempted to sue the makers of Viagra , claiming that the erectile dysfunction drug contributed to the spread of HIV .Mr. Weinstein consistently misrepresents the study data .First , he claims that PrEP only proved to be 44 % effective in preventing HIV infection .He avoids stating that closer examination of the study results shows that those in the study group who became infected with HIV were found to have no Truvada in their bloodstream , or only trace levels .In other words , the infected individuals failed to actually take Truvada daily as directed .None of the men who were found to actually be taking Truvada on a daily basis throughout the study became infected with HIV .Second , Mr. Weinstein complains that the study was n't \" real world , \" because those enrolled received monthly prevention counseling and health monitoring .To Mr. Weinstein , it was really the counseling that prevented infection , rather than PrEP .What Mr. Weinstein fails to recognize is that all study participants , including those taking a placebo , were given the same counseling and monitoring .In other words , the controlled study took this factor into account , so that the use of PrEP would truly be the only difference between the groups .When the study reports that PrEP was effective in reducing HIV infections , it reflects a situation in which all other factors were equal .For the men taking a placebo , counseling alone did n't protect them from HIV infection .Perhaps knowing that consistent , daily use of PrEP really did prevent HIV infection , Mr. Weinstein insists that gay men can not be relied upon to take Truvada daily .Mr. Weinstein does n't explain why he believes that the same men who ca n't be trusted to take a pill every day can be expected to use a condom every time they have sex ( the only prevention method he seems to approve ) .My own anecdotal experience contradicts Mr. Weinstein 's theory .I take my Truvada every night before bed .In the five months I 've been taking the drug , I 've forgotten only once , and I took it the following morning , making it a \" late \" dose , rather than a \" missed \" dose .I 'm not always the most responsible person on the planet , but I take my medication as directed because I realize that as part of a serodiscordant relationship , I have a comparatively high risk of infection .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"112.091064"}
