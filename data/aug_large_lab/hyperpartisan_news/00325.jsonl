{"text":"Several members advised the Pentagon 's 2010 DADT working group , and one member led the team that drafted the Defense Department 's plan for implementing DADT repeal .The findings of the 51-page study outline an outcome that repeal supporters expected would occur .Namely , that not much would change and that open service would not affect our military 's ability to defend the nation .Here 's a brief rundown of the findings : .No overall negative impact on military readiness or its component dimensions was noted ; .Recruitment was unaffected and remained robust ; .Retention was unaffected with no mass exodus ; two verifiable resignations of military chaplains were reported ; .Repeal has not been responsible for any new wave of violence or physical abuse among Servicemembers ; .No wave of mass disclosures of sexual orientation occurred and ; .Repeal has in fact enhanced the military 's ability to pursue its mission .CONCLUSION .Over the course of the year , SVV has seen the nation 's military take on repeal and flourish .As it turns out , the contribution to national defense by lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender Servicemembers has not diminished the military 's efforts to secure the country .With repeal turning one - year old , SVV looks forward to seeing what other milestones we will surpass as more proof that open service works comes to fruition .The work is not done though .To date , our Transgender Servicemembers still face a path of uncertainty before , during , and after military service .The progress is slow - going and we can not back down .Likewise with same - sex marriage within the ranks , military members who have married still can not extend benefits to their spouses .To this , it appears there is some progress being made : \" The Defense Department says it is studying the possibility of extending marital benefits to same - sex couples , but has announced no time frame .\" We 've heard this before .It only makes sense to gear up and be ready to engage in the effort for military equality as time passes .SVV plans to spread the word on Transgender service in November .It must also be noted that many of these issues affect our LGBT Veterans who now number over one million across the United States .That number is growing and , with it , significant issues as post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , military sexual trauma ( MST ) , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , and suicide .While many may not see these as LGBT - specific issues , they are signifiant byproducts of our military service and they do not discriminate .Sacramento Valley Veterans ( SVV ) is proud to have engaged in the fight for DADT repeal and to see how the year has pass with little incident .We have our Veterans , Servicemembers , Supporters , and Allies to thank for bringing us this significant milestone .Now , it 's time to celebrate .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"80.05501"}

Truman issued an executive order in 1948 that desegregated troops , banned racial discrimination in the military , and established an equal opportunity program .The current program has been expanded to provide recourse for service members facing discrimination on the basis of race , color , national origin , religion , and gender , and could easily incorporate sexual orientation as well .In the event that advocates can not secure an executive order from President Obama , it is imperative that members of Congress remove the Fleming Amendment from the FY 2014 National Defense Authorization Act .This would merely preserve the status quo for gay and lesbian service members but it would actively prevent opponents from giving individual service members a license to discriminate and tying the hands of commanders who wish to prevent such conduct .Congress should remove consensual sodomy as an offense .The Senate version of the 2014 NDAA bill includes a provision authored by Sen.
