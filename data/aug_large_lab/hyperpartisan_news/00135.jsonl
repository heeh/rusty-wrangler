Ross is believed to have shot and killed 19-year - old Deshawn Boykin during an Oct. 17 drug robbery .Rather than murder , though , Ross was charged only with unlawful gun possession as prosecutors believe Ross was attacked by Boykin and others during the robbery attempt .As a convicted felon , Ross , a 35-year - old Renton man , can not legally possess a firearm .Ross was indicted earlier this month , as was 19-year - old Lenny Brikn , Jr. , who is alleged to have robbed Ross with Boykin .According to state charging papers , Ross was preparing to sell 2 ounces of marijuana to Boykin shortly before 11 p.m. , when shots rang out at the Greystone Meadows apartment complex , located at 31500 First Avenue South .Writing the court , a Federal Way detective said Boykin and others arrived at the apartment complex to buy marijuana from Ross and an associate .Boykin and Brikn drew pistols and attempted to rob Ross 's associate , the detective continued .According to the detective 's statement , Ross then shouted that he was a police officer - he 's not - and opened fire as they attempted to run away .Boykin 's brother drove him to Saint Francis Medical Center in Federal Way , where he died from two gunshot wounds to the torso .During the investigation , police listened to a phone call during which Ross explained he shot at the young men to get them to run away , the detective told the court .The day after the deadly shooting , Ross was shot by police as they attempted to arrest him at a Renton parking lot .According to charging papers , Ross was finally arrested following the shooting after attempting to run away .Initially hospitalized , Ross was transferred on Oct. 22 to the Norm Maleng Regional Justice Center in Kent .Prosecutors contend Ross admitted to firing a pistol during the robbery .The fatal shooting came at a time when Washington 's marijuana law is almost entirely in flux .While no state law currently prohibits marijuana smoking or user - level possession , there is currently no legal way to buy or sell pot for recreational use .The state is currently crafting a legal framework through which marijuana can be bought , sold and grown , though all marijuana possession remains illegal under federal law .Federal prosecutors have brought charges against several marijuana dealers caught using firearms to defend themselves .In a statement Wednesday , U.S. Attorney for Western Washington Jenny Durkan described guns and marijuana as a \" deadly mix and an appropriate target for federal prosecution . \"\" The violent conduct in this case could have resulted in injuries or death to innocent bystanders , \" Durkan said in the statement .Ross has been charged with discharging a firearm during a drug crime , which carries a mandatory minimum term of 10 years in prison .Brikn has been charged with brandishing a gun during a drug crime , which carries a seven - year minimum term .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"65.838615"}
