Nazarbayev .Within days of the visit , Mr. Giustra 's fledgling company , UrAsia Energy Ltd. , signed a preliminary deal giving it stakes in three uranium mines controlled by the state - run uranium agency Kazatomprom .It also reported that several months later , Mr. Giustra had donated $ 31.3 million to Mr. Clinton 's foundation .[ ... ] [ T]he ultimate authority to approve or reject the Russian acquisition rested with the cabinet officials on the foreign investment committee , including Mrs. Clinton - whose husband was collecting millions of dollars in donations from people associated with Uranium One .Romney , in his interview with Hugh Hewitt , explained that because Bill and Hillary are married , their assets are co - mingled .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"48.974014"}

{"text":"Why I chuckle ?I ca n't stand moderates .I 'm not kidding .Our political spectrum is exceedingly narrow as it is .If someone ca n't find their way to one end or the other , then they 're complete milktoast .Of course talking of a ' spectrum ' is inaccurate at best - we 're dealing with multiple orthogonal facets , not a single linear space .Extreme left ( talking way off our current spectrum ) leads to small government and strong individual liberties ( think classical liberalism ) .Extreme right leads to small government and strong individual liberties ( think social libertarianism ) .Coincidently , this ' extreme ' location at both ends is where this country started out .All 3 candidates mentioned are 180 degrees from this starting point - the peak of statism .The reason all 3 are fighting to differentiate themselves is because they are all cramped in the minuscule universe of modern US politics and consciousness - and any moderate is simply standing on tiptoe at the peak .This is an issue in all caucus states .( Texas it seems is combo primary / caucus situation ) .Case in point : A friend just attended his county convention ( caucus state ) .His county elected delegates to go the state convention - 27 % of those delegates were Ron Paul supporters .This county only reported about 15 % Ron Paul supporters in all the precinct caucuses - based on the presidential preference polls .This has turned out to be true in many caucus states - Ron Paul will get roughly twice the delegates that the MSM has projected .Not enough to make a real difference in the end result , but enough difference to potentially make a statement at the national convention - not to mention the potential to effect the party platform via the convention resolution process .So I concur - the actual delegate count for a given candidate as reported by the media is simply mapped from the preferential polls numbers .How those delegates map out in the real world has a lot to do with the veracity of the folks backing the candidates .In the example given , Ron Paul supporters are much more likely to be elected as delegates than their opponents backers at the caucuses and conventions .The caucus process in general is very complicated - and each state can be different .The mass media simply has no interest in attempting to inform the public - they would lose their audience in the first paragraph .I know - I 've seen lots of blank looks as I explain this to folks .I think you 've hit on a big part of the problem .We need reporters to explain what 's happening and they either wo n't , because they think we 're too dumb to pay attention or they ca n't because they do n't know what they 're talking about .The people \" vetting \" our election have n't been \" vetted \" themselves .Try this thought on for size ... .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"78.656204"}

{"text":"Actually , it 's a very interesting Russian phenomenon why all friends of Vladimir Putin who wants to be in business they became billionaires so soon .My third example also comes from the world 's energy resources .In Russia , a company called Trasneft has a monopoly on the transportation of oil .According to the official records , Transeft not only a transportation monopoly but also the biggest charitable donor in Russia .They give half - a - billion dollars in charity over to U.S. Sounds good , indeed , but the problem is that no one knows who received the gifts .After exhausting considerable efforts we were able to locate just two recipients of these mysterious charities .One of them is Kremlin Line Foundation ( ph ) .Kremlin Line was created by the former secret service officials and we have uncovered sufficient ground to allege that this so - called charity is just a fraud through which Transneft pays bribe to secret service - ( inaudible ) - when Transeft want to squelch an investigation .This strategy is works for them - works for them .In our case we spent two years pressing the interior ministry to investigate this classified charity .After several months when the ministry had a deadline to announce the result of the investigation the representative came to the hearing and said , oops , we lost the file .There is no case anymore .And of course it was a huge scandal , we sued them successfully and we forced them to start an investigation again .A couple of weeks ago when another deadline came and they were supposed to announce the result of investigation the representative came to the hearing and said , sorry , we lost the file again .Of course , this will set up a huge scandal so our work at least accomplished that .Transneft still operates in shadows and is still hiding the identity of the recipient of the so called charity .But our litigation drew attention to the cover ups so the government was pressured into reinforcing our rules of transparency for Transneft .The company has been forced to disclose their own incrimination - even more incrimination information about their work .So we managed to use the system against the system to protect investors ' interests efficiently .I described just three , very typical , examples of the corruption among the dozens we are investigating .So why does it matter for you ?Corruption in Russia effects share pricing for shareholders around the world which hurts corporate portfolios and the retirement funds of little American guy .It also made a hit to your tax base and your economy because U.S. funds have invested billions of dollars in Russian companies .Not only do we fight to reduce the damage suffered by American and other investors but our work , also , draws attention to human - rights violations .When we expose corruption officials try to hide their tracks .At times some of them have resorted to violence and degradation to protect their careers .","label":"true","metadata":{},"score":"79.50824"}
