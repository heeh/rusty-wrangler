{"text":"Do I need to even explain this ?You are all familiar with the constant bitching by vile progs about FOX News .You are all well aware of the slap - fight Trump had with Megyn Kelly .And I dare say you all are already aware that he won that stand off when he refused to attend the debate .He drew 2.7 million viewers away from the debate , and had every single inch of other media covering him for 48 hours surrounding the debate .He even managed to make FOX sympathetic to the left for a minute , a chit he 's sure to call in later .One of the common misperceptions about the 2008 campaign is that Hillary Clinton gacked the nomination like a kicker pushing a 30-yard field goal into the sidelines .This is not quite right .She made a critical miscalculation in not spending enough to organize several small - state caucuses .That hurt her dearly .But she also suffered from several factors beyond her control : the left 's continuing rejection of the Iraq war , the media 's complicity in keeping John Edwards viable until he could wound her in Iowa , and the total solidarity of African - American voters with Barack Obama .Because of these developments , the Democratic party establishment abandoned her at the first opportunity , taking with it superdelegates , endorsements , and a giant pile of money , all of which it eagerly transferred to Obama .And despite all of this , Clinton still won more Democratic primary votes than Obama did- only to find out that the party of Al Gore was suddenly obsessed with procedural technicalities and no longer cared about raw vote totals .The fact that she was able to win more votes than Obama in the face of such adversity is testament to her political grit .Clinton began that race as a soft , liberal feminist .But when it became clear that this coalition was no longer enough to win the nomination , she went out and assembled a new one on the fly .Always remember : When Barack Obama mocked Americans who bitterly cling to their guns and religion , he was talking about Clinton 's voters .If I had the chance to do it over again I would not have voted for Hillary .I would not have voted for any of the Democrats .But that does not change the fact that I DID vote for Hillary and that my vote was STOLEN by a corrupt Democrat party .A black high school student spent the day volunteering at a Donald Trump campaign office to put to rest any doubt that he is free to criticize Trump and his supporters of being racist .Or at least , from high school Junior James Patterson 's questionable description about his experience , that 's what it appears .Despite admitting that his fellow \" white \" volunteers were \" very friendly \" and \" normal , \" he made the stretch to fit them into his narrow prism of progressive ideology .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"66.8994"}
