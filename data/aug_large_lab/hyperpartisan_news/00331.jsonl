Sanders has described Leopold as so close a friend as to be considered \" family . \"He reportedly discouraged Sanders ' socialist impulses early in their careers .Efforts to reach Leopold were unsuccessful .Shortly after Leopold 's son , also named Jonathan , purchased the resort , Burlington College began writing it large checks for all - inclusive stays for its study abroad students .The younger Leopold later said during a deposition related to a lawsuit filed by a student who was injured at the rest that he conducted boat tours and snorkeling trips \" on behalf of Burlington College .\" From 2009 through 2011 , when O'Meara Sanders stepped down as president of the school , it paid the resort about $ 68,000 , according to annual tax filings .The payments stopped the year after she left the position .Her departure was a source of controversy .She reportedly overstated pledged contributions to the school in order to secure a loan from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington .The diocese lost between $ 1.5 million and $ 2 million on the deal , according to local reports .By that time , the school had paid huge sums to the Vermont Woodworking School , which is run by Driscoll .The college eventually paid the school more than $ 500,000 for classes at its Fairfax , Vt . , campus , about 30 miles from Burlington .Burlington College even established a Master of Fine Arts program in woodworking with leased space at the school as its major facility .A survey released late Saturday afternoon by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics finds that Sanders , the fiery progressive senator from Vermont , trails Clinton 37 % to 30 % .The former secretary of state has lost one - third of her supporters since May.Sanders ' support owes more to voters ' enthusiasm for his candidacy than opposition to Clinton , the poll found .A whopping 96 % of his backers say they support him and his ideas , with just 2 % saying their vote is motivated by a desire to stop a Clinton candidacy .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"61.028973"}

{"text":"Indeed , some of Portmann 's alleged tricks have surprised even veteran watchers of the nation 's mortgage meltdown .The former Pierce Commercial co - worker says that Portmann would not only conjure up imaginary jobs , but fake W-2s as well .And if borrowers did n't have enough cash on hand to qualify for a mortgage - well , that was not a problem , either .Portmann , according to authorities , would \" season \" his clients ' bank accounts with his own money , some of which he kept stashed in a home safe for just that purpose .\" I 've never heard of that deception before , \" says Alan Hess , a professor of finance at the University of Washington .The 38-year - old Portmann is now under investigation by the FBI .The U.S. Attorney 's office wo n't comment on the case in advance of an indictment , which sources expect to be imminent .In a business where every new mortgage brings in fees , Portmann would do whatever was necessary to close as many loans as possible .He was extraordinarily successful .From the time he started at Pierce Commercial , in 2004 , until he left four years later , Portmann generated more than 5,200 loans .That accounted for nearly half of the $ 2.2 billion loan business done by his entire division , which by one account employed some 80 loan officers .On average , Portmann was closing roughly 120 loans a month .By way of contrast , an average hard - working mortgage broker might close between 10 and 15 loans a month , according to Brad Williamson , head of the banking division of the state Department of Financial Institutions .\" I believe he personally was the largest single loan producer in the state , \" Williamson says .Indeed , from the small burg of Puyallup , best known for its roller coasters and animal exhibits during its annual state fair , Portmann turned himself into a national powerhouse .In fact , the trade publication Mortgage Originator repeatedly ranked him among the top 10 loan brokers in the country .Given the percentage of his loans that were allegedly fraudulent , Portmann may also have set another kind of personal record .David Leen , a prominent Seattle real - estate lawyer , says , \" That 's a staggering number of defective loans . \"Ultimately , the bad loans brought down the 13-year - old Pierce Commercial Bank , once a respected community institution that specialized in small - business loans .On November 5 , DFI closed the bank , following mortgage - related losses and more than a year of investigations conducted by its own agency as well as the FBI and the Federal Housing Administration .Heritage Bank acquired the failed bank 's assets .If Portmann is indicted , he will be one of the first banking officials in the country to face criminal responsibility for the shady loan practices that have brought the financial industry - and the entire national economy - to its knees .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"92.821304"}
{"text":"The Rawsons had questions about how it would work . \"He 'd brush you off , \" Dina says . \"He was very condescending , \" adds Matt .He recalls dropping off some paperwork to Portmann , who was camped out at the Toscanos bar .Matt broached some concerns he had .\" You 're thinking too much , \" Matt says Portmann told him . \"He 's beyond narcissist , \" volunteers another borrower , a real - estate investor named John Alderson , who received a mortgage through Portmann for an $ 8 million home in Bonney Lake .Despite the large sum involved , Alderson says Portmann would spare literally only a few minutes to talk to him .\" We 're done , goodbye , \" Portmann would say .Other borrowers , meanwhile , felt deceived by Portmann .A Pierce County real - estate agent , who spoke on condition of anonymity , says that Portmann would often tell his clients one thing when making a good - faith estimate for a loan . \"And then they 'd get to closing , and there would be a different interest rate , a different down payment .My clients would be panicking .\" One couple working with Portmann reported that someone forged their signatures on documents that required them to pay penalties if they paid off their loan early .Another borrower said Portmann swore at him when he asked for help with his loan .Another claims that Portmann \" pushed him into signing a contract under dire duress , \" according to a summary provided by DFI .The borrower wanted to get out of the loan after he found out that the monthly payments were much higher than stated in the estimate , but said Portmann told him that to do so would cost $ 10,000 .Yet despite such treatment , borrowers , real - estate agents , and builders continued to work with Portmann .Sanders says real - estate professionals had a particular reason to do so : Portmann would shower them with new cars and trips to Vegas so that they would refer home buyers to him .Portmann treated himself well too . \"He was known for changing his cars every year , \" Sanders says .\" When the FJ Cruiser came out , he had to be one of the first ones who had one .\" But professionals and borrowers alike had a more basic reason for using Portmann : He was the guy who could get a mortgage for anyone , anytime . \"Absolutely always , \" says Paul Pohlreich , a Pierce County developer who worked often with Portmann .\" I do n't know how .There was no other lender who could do that . \"According to Sanders , it helped that Portmann owned various rental properties and had begun to develop housing .So when a borrower was unemployed , Portmann would sometimes indicate on applications that the person worked for one of the several companies he had formed to manage his properties .And he could use the names of his companies on those fake W-2 forms Sanders says he created .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"95.61513"}

Sanders has started is competently followed through , the results should be far more penetrating and objective than the rather superficial effort of the FCIC ( Financial Crisis Investigation Commission ) headed by Philip Angelides which was published in January of 2011 .Serious criticism of that panel and its reports have been written by , among others , Yves Smith of Naked Capitalism and by the aforementioned William K.
