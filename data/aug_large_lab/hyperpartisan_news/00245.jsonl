{"text":"I 'm so sorry for your friend 's result .There are two possible reasons for why she has not seen outward signs ( a common result on scans as many who go to the club scanning programmes will confirm ! )People who have neuropathic pain will confirm that this is often the case , you just get on with things .Dr Marino said that of the syrinxes had come on suddenly , say as the result of an impact , the dog would probably have died of pain -- it would have been intolerable .But they simply learn to live with it .That is why many SM dogs get scoliosis when younger -- where their neck bends in a C -- which is a reaction to the pain of a syrinx .They curve their neck to relieve the pain from the syrinx .But typically , scoliosis gradually goes away .The reason is most likely that the dog learns to live with that level of discomfort .The other reason is that as Dr Rusrbidge 's and Nick Jeffrie 's work has shown , pain is correlated to the width and position of the syrinx .Large syrinxes that are lopsided and close or against the walls of the spinal cord cause pain .Smaller or more centralised syrinxes tend not to .Also CSF flow seems to be very elevant .Some dogs seem to have different flow patterns that cause less pain .This is known in humans -- there is published work on it .The problem is that dogs with syrinxes tend to be a lot more likely to eventually show signs of pain .That is why it can show in older dogs who showed no signs for most of their life .They may just have adjusted to the pain .My Leo has one large , short but wide syrinx in his spine .It is fairly central so we seem lucky that it has not caused more pain that it has .His scratching has gradually become more pronounced to the extent that he has scratched off the darker outer layer of hair on his ears , but to an onlooker he is a happy outgoing dog .Only occasionally is he sensitive to touch in certain areas .But he also has balance problems that would never be noticed by most people .Most owners might just joke that their dog is a bit clumsy .I know this is due to some limb weakness .Neurologists can do some clinical tests of a dog 's reactions etc to see whether there are signs and sensitivities an owner can easily miss .This is oftem the case -- the signs are there but they are what specialists spot , not what owners notice .It would IMHO be smart to start a dog with syrinxes on something like frusemide or cimetidine .There is some evidence that this slows or even halts syrinx development if started early enough -- and can not do much harm .One of the real problems with SM is that it manifests itself in so many different ways ( which can also be symptoms of other unrelated conditions ) and is so unpredictable .","label":"false","metadata":{},"score":"110.42399"}
