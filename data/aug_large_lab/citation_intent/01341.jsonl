{"text":"In recent work , we introduced N - fold Templated Piped Correction , or NTPC ( ' ' nitpick ' ' ) , an intriguing error corrector that is designed to work in these extreme operating conditions .Despite its simplicity , it consistently and robustly improves the accuracy of existing highly accurate base models .","label":"Uses","metadata":{},"score":"79.28389"}
{"text":"The robustness experiments were conducted across various data sets following NIST MetricsMaTr protocols , showing higher Kendall correlation with human adequacy judgments against BLEU , METEOR ( with and without synsets ) , WER , PER , TER and CDER .The Jaccard coefficient is shown to be more discriminative and robust than cosine similarity , the Min / Max metric with mutual information , Jensen Shannon divergence , or the Dice 's coefficient .","label":"Uses","metadata":{},"score":"79.33559"}
